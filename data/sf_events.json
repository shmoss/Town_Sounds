Warning is UK based doom metal band. Warning flagged the rise of post-2000 wave of traditional doom metal. They were formed by Patrick Walker in 1994 in Harlow, Essex. The band is notable for its down-tempo, progressive, melodic and heavy doom-laden sound; the idiosyncratic and poignant vocals of Patrick Walker; and his introspective, darkly-confessional lyrical themes of acute pain, love, and melancholy nostalgia. The band released two demo tapes, \"Revelation Looms\" in Feb 1996 and \"Blessed By Sabbath\" in March 1997. They debuted 1999 with \"The Strength To Dream\". With this album, Warning gained a cult status within doom metal circles, but they soon disbanded after their 2001 European tour with Jack Frost. They regrouped in 2005 to perform at The Doom Shall Rise festival in Germany, and released second album \"Watching From A Distance\" in 2006 to much wide acclaim. Both albums were re-issued on CD in 2008 by the label Cyclone Empire, \"The Strength To Dream\" being re-packaged in new sleeve artwork. At the same time \"Watching From A Distance\" was released by the Metal Supremacy label as a LTD edition gatefold double-vinyl. 2. Power metal band from Poland (active). 3.
