Like an aircraft\u2019s black box for which the album is titled, Black Radio holds the truth and is indestructible. Rapper yasiin bey (Mos Def) illuminates the metaphor on the title track: Big bird falling down on a mountain pass Only thing to survive the crash Black Radio You wanna fly free go far and fast Built to last We made this craft From Black Radio Robert Glasper has long kept one foot planted firmly in jazz and the other in hip-hop and R&B. He\u2019s worked extensively with Q-Tip, playing keyboards on the rapper\u2019s 2008 album The Renaissance and co-writing the album single \u201cLife Is Better\u201d which featured his label mate Norah Jones. Glasper also serves as the music director in yasiin bey\u2019s touring band, and has toured with the multi-platinum R&B singer Maxwell. The Los Angeles Times once wrote that \u201cit's a short list of jazz pianists who have the wherewithal to drop a J Dilla reference into a Thelonious Monk cover, but not many jazz pianists are Robert Glasper,\u201d adding that \u201che's equally comfortable in the worlds of hip-hop and jazz,\u201d and praising the organic way in which he \u201cbuilds a bridge between his two musical touchstones.\u201d Glasper drove that point home with his last album, 2009\u2019s Double-Booked, which was split neatly in half. The first part featured his acoustic Trio, which had gathered a great deal of acclaim in the jazz world and beyond over the course of two previous Blue Note albums (2005\u2019s Canvas and 2007\u2019s In My Element). The second part featured his electric Experiment band and hinted at things to come, even earning the keyboardist his first GRAMMY nomination for \u201cAll Matter,\u201d a collaboration with the singer Bilal that was among the contenders in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category in 2010. With Black Radio, the Experiment band has fully arrived. Featuring Glasper on piano and Fender Rhodes, Casey Benjamin on vocoder and saxophone, Derrick Hodge on electric bass, and Chris Dave on drums, the band is plugged in and open source. Each of the band members is prodigiously talented and lives naturally in multiple musical worlds, distilling countless influences into a singular voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this band unique,\u201d says Glasper. \u201cWe can go anywhere, literally anywhere, we want to go. We all have musical ADD and we love it.\u201d Black Radio also features many of Glasper\u2019s famous friends from across the spectrum of urban music, seamlessly incorporating appearances from a jaw-dropping roll call of special guests including Erykah Badu, Bilal, Lupe Fiasco, Lalah Hathaway, Shafiq Husayn (Sa-Ra), KING, Ledisi, Chrisette Michele, Musiq Soulchild, Meshell Ndegeocello, Stokley Williams (Mint Condition), and yasiin bey. \u201cI wanted to do a record that showcased the fact that we play with artists in other genres,\u201d explains Glasper, adding that the album has \u201cmore of an urban, hip-hop, soul kind of vibe, but the spine of it all is still a jazz spine.\u201d What may be most remarkable about Black Radio is how Glasper (who also produced the record) was able to weave all these different voices into a cohesive album, avoiding the random patchwork feel that many \u201cspecial guest\u201d projects suffer from. \u201cThe record doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a special guest record because of the relationships we all have,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are all friends. All the guests on the album have musical similarities.\u201d That common ground and comfort level is what created the spontaneous spirit of adventure and experimentation that permeated the recording sessions, which all the band members describe as being more fun than work. Friends would drop by the studio in Los Angeles to hang out, listen to the band, get inspired, and jump into the vocal booth to lay down a track. \u201cThese are all people who are known for being in another genre,\u201d says Glasper, \u201cbut at heart they\u2019re jazz musicians, so they\u2019re like \u2018Let\u2019s hit it. We don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen but let\u2019s go for it and see what happens.\u2019 We all have that in common, which is why I chose the people I chose.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t pigeonhole what we\u2019re going to do or how we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Glasper declares. The Experiment wears its eclecticism on its sleeve throughout Black Radio, presenting new collaborative originals and surprising cover songs. They transform the Afro-Cuban standard \u201cAfro Blue\u201d with Badu, Sade\u2019s \u201cCherish the Day\u201d with Hathaway, David Bowie\u2019s \u201cLetter to Hermione\u201d with Bilal, and Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d with Benjamin\u2019s vocoder vocal. Glasper and Lupe Fiasco (whose recent gig together at the Blue Note Club in New York became a freestyle jam session when Kanye West and yasiin bey crashed the stage) co-wrote \u201cAlways Shine\u201d which features Fiasco\u2019s lyrical flow as well as a searing chorus sung by Bilal. On \u201cGonna Be Alright,\u201d the R&B singer Ledisi highlights Glasper\u2019s bright melodicism by writing new lyrics for his instrumental \u201cF.T.B.\u201d from the In My Element album. The track \u201cAh Yeah\u201d (a co-production with Glasper\u2019s high school friend, the GRAMMY-winning producer Bryan-Michael Cox) is illustrative of the good fate that hung over the sessions. Glasper went to Atlanta to record with Musiq Soulchild at Cox\u2019s studio. At a show the night before the session Glasper ran into singer Chrisette Michele and asked her to come by the studio as well the next day. The resulting duet is one of the album\u2019s highlights. Reflecting back, Glasper is rightly proud of Black Radio, but also humbled and grateful for the outpouring of support and talent that it took to bring the album into being. \u201cEveryone just said yes, period, we\u2019ll do it. It was smoother than I ever thought it would be to get all these great, amazing artists to come together and do this project.\u201d Career-wise, this creates a constant balancing act, and on occasion literally being double-booked, appearing with the Trio and the Experiment on the same night. Such is the storyline that emerges on Double-Booked, with conflicting voicemail messages from Terence Blanchard and Roots drummer Ahmir ?uestlove Thompson, each pulling for a different Glasper band. \u201cMost people, if they have different bands, they do separate albums,\u201d says Glasper. \u201cBut I felt I\u2019d be making more of a statement if I put it all on one joint.\u201d The result, in essence, is a snapshot of Glasper\u2019s life. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I play jazz but I also play hip-hop now and then. I\u2019m in it, for real, both sides of the spectrum. That\u2019s my life. A lot of people go in stages\u2014they might focus on trio for a long time, then they change or whatever. My thing is both, all the time.\u201d The first six tracks on Double-Booked feature Glasper in Trio setting with longtime bassist Vicente Archer as well as drummer Chris Dave, who plays in Glasper\u2019s Experiment band but recently came on board the Trio as well. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find that common thread in one cat,\u201d Glasper enthuses. \u201cVery few cats out there are extremely convincing in all genres of music. There\u2019s always a wink-wink somewhere, like they play jazz really good but the hip-hop\u2019s a little strange, or vice versa. Chris has both sides down on an even level, and he keeps on creating. He and Vicente used to play together with Kenny Garrett, so they have a history that made the linkup a lot easier. He knows the Chris-isms and Chris knows the Vicente-isms.\u201d As on In My Element, Glasper underlines the Trio\u2019s hip-hop leanings with short fade-in interludes (\u201clittle Pete Rock-isms,\u201d Glasper says) that function as short codas to some of the tunes. From the outset, with the lyrical flow and supple interaction of \u201cNo Worries,\u201d one hears what Nate Chinen of The New York Times describes as \u201cspongey, changeable adaptations of hip-hop rhythm tracks\u2026Glasper himself plays as if he\u2019s a living sample\u2026in a kind of real-time loop.\u201d \u201cThis is a little ditty I came up with when I was in London at a soundcheck,\u201d Glasper recalls. \u201cWe played it that night at the show. I kept hearing people in London say \u2018no worries,\u2019 and that seemed like the title. It has a real positive, bright, \u2018It\u2019s ok\u2019 vibe.\u201d \u201cDowntime,\u201d set mainly in 7/4, evokes a memory of Glasper looking out the window at the rain\u2014\u201ckind of like the \u2018F.T.B.\u2019 of this record, if you will,\u201d Glasper says, referencing a standout track from In My Element. Both \u201cYes I\u2019m Country (And That\u2019s OK)\u201d and \u201c59 South,\u201d meanwhile, touch upon Glasper\u2019s hometown environment in Texas. The latter references a heavily trafficked highway in Houston, a cultural reference not unlike the Brooklyn Bridge in Glasper\u2019s current home base, New York. \u201cYes I\u2019m Country\u201d prompts Glasper to explain: \u201cI have a country swing when I play sometimes, and I like playing that way.\u201d The vamp of the tune, an intriguing five-bar phrase, exemplifies the sort of off-kilter rapport that sets the Glasper Trio apart. \u201cI love odd phrases that vamp,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt brings a whole different feeling than a regular vamp.\u201d The Trio portion of Double-Booked culminates with an astonishing treatment of Thelonious Monk\u2019s \u201cThink of One.\u201d In an ingenious and totally natural overlay, Glasper seizes an opportunity in last A section to quote Ahmad Jamal\u2019s \u201cSwahililand,\u201d the chord progression that formed the basis of De La Soul\u2019s 1996 hip-hop classic \u201cStakes Is High,\u201d co-written by Glasper\u2019s hero and friend, the late beatmaster J Dilla. \u201cMonk and Dilla are both passed away, so when I play live I sometimes say they\u2019re both probably in heaven, chillin\u2019. Maybe they\u2019re talking about this arrangement! I always wanted to mix a jazz joint with a hip-hop joint but make it dope, not contrived. Chris\u2019s drumbeat is so crazy at the end, the hi-hat with the placement of the bass drum\u2014you don\u2019t get this on a jazz record, ever. That\u2019s why I made it the last Trio tune, because it\u2019s a perfect segue.\u201d From that point forward, we are firmly in Experiment-land, with Chris Dave remaining on drums\u2014although the drum sound on this half of the album can be markedly different from the first. \u201c4Eva,\u201d a live excerpt featuring rap icon Mos Def, leads us straight into another world. \u201cButterfly\u201d is originally from Thrust, Herbie Hancock\u2019s 1974 landmark album. Hancock, as both a pianist and a genre-crossing innovator, is of course a huge influence on Glasper. \u201cIt just happens that every one of my records has a Herbie tune\u2014it seems like I\u2019m doing it on purpose,\u201d Glasper says. \u201cI\u2019m not. But I had to put this on the record because it\u2019s dope.\u201d Casey Benjamin\u2019s vocoder effects heighten the mystery of the melody, and a J Dilla beat called \u201cF--- the Police\u201d serves as a rhythmic foundation. Benjamin\u2019s arsenal of sonic effects is at the fore of \u201cFestival,\u201d colored by Glasper\u2019s Fender Rhodes, taking wild, digressive turns over the course of 10 minutes\u2014the Experiment sound at its most representative and expansive. \u201cCasey has so many pedals, it\u2019s a whole thing when he sets up, he has to go to the gig before us,\u201d says Glasper with a laugh, noting that Benjamin is playing only alto saxophone and \u201cnothing\u2019s overdubbed.\u201d A short transitional piece, \u201cFor You\u201d by Benjamin and drummer Sameer Gupta, leads into \u201cAll Matter,\u201d a striking, unclassifiable original by vocalist Bilal Oliver. Glasper offers: \u201cYou can really do this song in any situation, and it does stick with you. So pretty.\u201d Derrick Hodge, the Experiment\u2019s bassist, an accomplished composer as well as a top-shelf jazz and hip-hop sideman, contributes the final track, \u201cOpen Mind,\u201d also featuring Bilal. It\u2019s \u201ca spiritual tune\u201d in Glasper\u2019s words, with additional textures and voice elements from turntablist Jahi Sundance, the son of alto saxophone great Oliver Lake. Hailed by listeners and critics, Glasper has also garnered the respect of the toughest audience of all: musicians from across the jazz spectrum. In a May 2008 Blindfold Test for Down Beat magazine, a fellow pianist instantly identified Glasper and praised him as \u201ca fantastic musician,\u201d pinpointing characteristics of his unique style: \u201ca harmonic maze, but also an insistent rhythm, certain turns and filigrees and ornaments, some of them sort of gospelish.\u201d With Double-Booked, Glasper further develops all these elements and pulls them together in a new synthesis, continuing his ascent to the top ranks of modern jazz artistry.", "otherInfo": "A collaboration between two longtime friends, Dinner Party brings together keyboardist and composer Robert Glasper and saxophonist / producer Terrace Martin for a project..."}, {"Address": "915 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133", "Artist": "Grant Lyon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6188983.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.8029233, -122.4142026], "Date": "2021-07-15", "EventDate": "Jul. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Cobb's Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
