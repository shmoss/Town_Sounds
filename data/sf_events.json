The brainchild of the group's founder, lead writer and rapper Rafael Vargas, Fulanito is the first group known to combine \"perico ripiao\" - traditional accordion-based merengue sounds from the hills of the Dominican Republic - with modern hip-hop and rap. While industry leaders initially questioned the commercial potential of such an unusual mix of sounds, Fulanito proved them wrong, becoming a party favorite in the U.S., the top-selling act in Colombia, and one of the most recognizable and adored Latin acts from Chile to Switzerland to Japan. With their 1997 debut album, \"El Hombre Mas Famoso de la Tierra\" \"(The Most Famous Man in the Land,)\" Fulanito fast gained international fame with the hit singles \"Guallando\" (\"Grinding\") and \"La Novela\" (\"The Soap Opera.\") The album sold 500,000 copies, shocking even Vargas, who says he expected it to sell no more than 10,000, and hoped it would simply \"help us get gigs\". \"Guallando\" featured 61-year-old accordionist Arsenio de la Rosa's lightening chops, and was a surprise hit, co-opted for jingles spun endlessly in nightclubs across the hemisphere. According to Miami-based music writer Karl Ross, \"Guallando\" marked the first time U.S.-born Dominican performers began to mine their musical roots for inspiration. The addictive, resulting sound appeals as readily to rap fans and world music aficionados - and to many in between. Boston Globe music writer Elijah Wald called Fulanito's sound \"fresh and hip, completely different from the mechanical beat of most house fusions\". The word \"Fulanito\" means, roughly, \"Little John Doe\" in Spanish slang. The roots of the word lie in West Africa, where Spaniards kidnapped men and women to be brought to Spanish colonies in the New World. Among the people brought to the Spanish Caribbean were those of the Fulani nation, known in Africa as great merchants. They brought their skills of commerce with them, and eventually it was known in the Caribbean that if you wanted something done, you went to the Fulani, or business guy. Vargas, who is proud of his African lineage, was born in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, one year after his parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and grew up in a home saturated with tradition Latin sounds, including his mother's favorites: merengue and bolero. In the early 1990s Vargas scored an international dance/house music hit in English with \"Wiggle It\", recorded by his first organized group, 2 in a Room. The single sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. Vargas formed a follow-up group, the 740 Boyz, with Winston de la Rosa - Arsenio de la Rosa's son. While hanging out at the de la Rosa household, Vargas was treated to many impromptu concerts by the elder de la Rosa, and was reminded of how excited Dominicans got when they heard the traditional old merengue sounds. Having shunned his parents' music for most of his life, Vargas suddenly became intrigued by the idea of combining rap, hip-hop and perico ripiao. He asked the elder de la Rosa if he would mind experimenting a bit. Soon, the accordionist and the rappers were recording \"Guallando\". The song was completed in 1996, and Vargas played it for friends and family to test the waters. \"They loved it\", he says. \"They went nuts\". He approached several large Latin labels, and was rejected by all. \"They said they didn't think it would sell anywhere outside of New York and the D.R.\" Finally, Vargas convinced his house/dance label, Cutting Records, to press a Fulanito CD in 1997. The resulting half million in sales astounded everyone in the Latin music industry, where a mere 50,000 sold represents a gold album. Fulanito's second album, \"El Padrino\" \"(The Godfather)\", was released in 1999. On it, the group experimented even more, incorporating the sounds of samba and other Latin rhythms. Vargas raps about his life, about people he has known, and about having a good time. He was sorry to see the title cut from \"El Padrino\" misinterpreted by some as glorifying gangster life, saying his intention was just the opposite. \"The gangster dies at the end\", he says. \"Sure, he had a lot of money, cars, women, but none of it mattered because he was dead\". Vargas says he wrote it with some of the young men he'd grown up with in mind. Another song on the album, \"Mother's Day,\" shows a softer side of Vargas, as he pays tribute to his mom. The group's third album, The Remixes, was released in March of 2001, and contains three new songs. Their fourth album is expected in the fall of 2001. With a solid tour schedule that takes the group from North Carolina to Japan in the span of a month, Fulanito shows no signs of slowing down. In the coming months, Vargas and others hope to more people on the West Coast and in the mainstream U.S. market to their music.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3395 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94110", "Artist": "Atrevido ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.7423116, -122.4217291], "Date": "2021-07-18", "EventDate": "Jul. 18th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Club Malibu", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1511 Haight St, San Francisco, CA 94117-2912", "Artist": "Junk Parlor ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11524815.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.76976860000001, -122.4471395], "Date": "2021-07-19", "EventDate": "Jul. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Junk, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Junk Parlor@Club Deluxe", "moreBioInfo": "JUNK PARLOR Biography A galvanizing force on the Bay Area indie rock scene since launching serendipitously in 2013, Junk Parlor is that crazy-rare band whose vibe is so driven by joyful schizophrenia that it transcends easy genre trappings. Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "BIT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6373397.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-19", "EventDate": "Jul. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Psy Trance, Electronic, Goa Trance", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DEATH GUILD\nMain Room:\n Decay\n Joe Radio\n Melting Girl\nLounge:\n Sage\n Bit\nDeath Guild is the oldest weekly goth/industrial dance night in the world!

Patti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others. Tuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz. In 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day. In 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan. That's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "Feinsteins at the Nikko is thrilled to welcome back legendary jazz duo Tuck & Patti. For 42 years this unique, genre-crossing vocal/guitar jazz duo has cast its passionate musical spell worldwide, capturing the hearts of lovers, the respect of jazz buffs and the jaw-dropping awe of guitarists and singers. To understand Tuck and Patti, start with the wellspring of love within them, then their music begins to make perfect sense. Married 39 years, Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart continue to stoke the fires, not only of their own love, but also of their love of life and their passion for making music together. They have a long-standing tradition: minimalist arrangements featuring Tuck's extraordinary virtuosity and Pattis rich mezzo soprano. Patti, renowned for her remarkable ability to touch hearts directly with her voice, exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he'll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger and producer.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium. McKee\u2019s tour dates have taken him through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, including tours with legendary acts from Dream Theater to Tommy Emmanuel.", "otherInfo": "This is Andy McKee's Guitar Camp featuring Yvette Young, Guitaro 5000, Trevor Gordon Hall, and special guest Michael Manring. its 4 days of workshops, lessons, and intimate performances.

The highly engaging four-piece dynamically performs around one microphone, where each instrument and voice crafts a specific part of each story; creating intimate, savory folk music that warms the heart and feeds the soul.\u201d -Nicholas Edward Williams, Earthtone Booking- The Riverside originated in Southern California where founding member, Jacob Jeanson (songwriter & guitar), was attending Westmont College in 2012. In his senior year, the band formed in hopes of winning Santa Barbara\u2019s battle of the bands. As an energetic and engaging folk band with foot stomping musical companions, the group was able to win the competition and release their first album with the winnings. In the following years, Jake got to play with many talented friends and personalities which helped mold the band\u2019s vision and created time to grow in tasteful and intentional songwriting; a nostalgic yet refreshing charm that leads listeners across a grand frontier of warm and beautiful scenery. However, the band was able to make the jump to full time when his wife Lorien Jeanson (mandolin & harmony) was added to the lineup. Lorien is originally from the redwood forest and farmlands of Northern California, but ended up attending the same college as Jake, where they met and fell in love. The duo swiftly began touring with a rotating cast of friends; playing in theatres, venues, festivals, and living room concerts across the United States. Regardless of their current friend lineup, the group aims to create a magical and organic vibe which translates into the feeling of the music, often singing and playing around a single old fashioned microphone, seamlessly blending the musical composition of their harmonies and instruments. Since 2012, the band has released 4 homegrown records and an EP, with more songs and albums in the works. Growing up and being raised listening to the likes of The Eagles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Jake and Lorien grew an appreciation and aim for group harmonies and heartfelt authenticity , while also striving to be amazing live performers like their modern influences , a few being Fleet Foxes, Mandolin Orange, and The Head and the Heart.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1 Paseo De San Antonio, San Jose, CA 95113", "Artist": "Ren Geisick, Vocalist ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11541563.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.3324831, -121.8892829], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Plaza de C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez", "moreBioInfo": "Bay Area-based vocalist Ren Geisick sings with radiant energy and a passion for storytelling.

Patti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others. Tuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz. In 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day. In 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan. That's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "Feinsteins at the Nikko is thrilled to welcome back legendary jazz duo, Tuck & Patti.

To understand Tuck and Patti, start with the wellspring of love within them, then their music begins to make perfect sense. Married 39 years, Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart continue to stoke the fires, not only of their own love, but also of their love of life and their passion for making music together. They have a long-standing tradition: minimalist arrangements featuring Tucks extraordinary virtuosity and Pattis rich mezzo soprano. Patti, renowned for her remarkable ability to touch hearts directly with her voice, exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he'll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger and producer. Without even blinking, Tuck-the-problem-solver brags, \"Patti writes and arranges; I am just the orchestra.\""}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Stu Allen ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [38.4011362, -122.8226923], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Hardstyle", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern Sebastopol", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Basement Tapes Live featuring Casual Coalition w/ Stu Al"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "John Elliott ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11502415.jpeg", "Coordinates": [38.08854600000001, -122.5534481], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.thehereafterishere.com", "otherInfo": "Opening for the great Bob Schneider!"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Ponyskull ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Performing Live:\n GREAT HIGHWAY -- https://www.takegreathighway.com/\n RYAN FLYNN -- https://www.ryanflynnmusic.com/\n PONYSKULL -- https://www.ponyskull.com/\nWith DJs:\n Vice Reine\nLive Visuals by: Fetz\nPlus a special screening of a new music video by Le Fomo!\nNow reinitializing the cosmic collision...

In the early 1990's, as Green on Red faded to black, Prophet began performing with his future wife Stefanie Finch and releasing independent records on a variety of small labels. Prophet released his solo debut Brother Aldo in 1990 on Fire records,(later reissued in the late 1990's on Walter Yetnikoff's Velvel imprint. His immediate career path took him through mostly European touring markets and his followup \"Balinese Dancer\" came out in 1993 & later the Steve Berlin produced \"Feast of Hearts\" came out in Europe only through the Fire imprint. After a decade long bout with substance abuse, Prophet resurfaced refreshed and renewed on the critical breakthroughs 1998's \"Homemade Blood\", 2000's \"The Hurting Business\" and 2002's live \"Turn The Pigeons Loose\" (all available via Cooking Vinyl in UK). By 2000 he'd recorded a side project with his wife Stefanie called Go Go Market and begun incorporating electronic influences into his traditional roots rock formula, resulting in some mainstream radio play and expanded exposure, culminating in the wider distribution of albums \"No Other Love\" from 2002 and 2004's \"Age of Miracles\" on New West Records. Chuck signed a new arrangement in the US with North Carolina based Yep Roc for 2007's \"Soap and Water\", an album that saw the musician invited to play twice on National Public Radio, as well as on televison talk shows like Late Night With David Letterman, and The Carson Daly Show. Over the years he also began collaborating with other songwriters like Kelly Willis, Steve Yerkey and contributing as a guitarist/musician to studio efforts from folks like Jonathan Richman, Warren Zevon, Kim Carnes, Cake, Tom Heyman and Jewel. Alejandro Escovedo's upcoming 2008 release produced by Tony Visconti entitled Real Animal was co-written and recorded with Prophet. In addition to having his songs recorded by artists like Solomon Burke, Heart & Cyndi Thomson he has also recorded with men who started out as his influences like Jim Dickinson, Dan Penn and the late Warren Zevon. www.chuckprophet.com. www.myspace.com/chuckprophetofficial.", "otherInfo": "The Basement Tapes Live featuring Casual Coalition w/ Stu Al"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Ryan Flynn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11242494.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Computer Music, Indie Pop, Electro Pop, Pop, Synth Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Originally begun as an experimental side project while in film school, ryan flynn has since evolved into a perpetual orb-praising space pop venture.
