How can a producer live up to that name some two decades after he was first bowled over by the newness and innovation of rave music? How, in short, does DJ Fresh stay fresh? Dan first became interested in 'Rave' music after older kids played him tapes from raves they had sneaked out of school to go to. Hearing tales of the early Acid house scene, Dan was captivated by the fledgling sound of Jungle Hardcore. Meeting one of Kingston\u2019s 'Scandal FM' DJs at university he was offered a regular set, and word got around of his production skills. Introduced to Vegas by MC moose and later Dbridge and Maldini, Bad Company was born. Their first track 'The Nine' (later voted the biggest drum and bass track of all time) began an onslaught of game changing beats that captivated the young imaginations of acts like Pendulum, Chase and Status, Sigma, Futurebound, Bassline Smith, Camo and Krooked and the Brookes Brothers. All of whom would soon sign records to Dan's new label venture 'Breakbeat Kaos' with Adam F. Dan's quest to spread the sound he loved finally started to break down doors at MTV and Radio 1. His website 'Dogs on Acid' (the biggest music forum in the world in 2003) spread the word of drum and bass worldwide, as some of the first ever playlisted drum and bass tracks tore their way onto the airwaves via the Breakbeat Kaos imprint. Pendulum became a sell-out Wembley arena act releasing the double platinum 'Hold your Colour' with Dan's guidance and a&r savvy. And the scene was set for the forthcoming invasion of the British mainstream charts. After Pendulum left Breakbeat Kaos to chase the major label dream, Dan changed focus back to working on his own music. His first collaboration with Ministry of Sound 'Gold Dust' graced the top forty for 18 weeks, becoming the highest selling track of the year not to make the top 10. Lucozade wanted a \u2018Gold Dust\u2019 of their own and commissioned Dan to attempt another collab with Video Director Ben Newman resulting in the award winning campaign, and the UK and worlds first Dubstep no.1 record with 'Louder'. The follow up to this, The first ever drum and bass no.1 'Hot Right Now' launched Rita Ora and paved the way for a string of top ten hits as Dan began a transition from producer to producer/writer. The support of Radio 1's Zane Lowe and Annie Mac placed his tracks at the heart of the new eclecticism, and he began to expand his tempo range. Inspired by newcomers like Flux Pavilion, Jack Beats and Dillon Francis, he took on jump-up dubstep, electro, Dutch house and even moombahton rhythms, which provided the foundations for his top 3 hit \u2018Dibby Dibby Sound', and Top 5 smashes 'Earthquake' with Diplo, and 'The Power' with Dizzy Rascal \u201cNow I can begin with the song and the vocal instead of the beat,\u201d he said, \u201cand let it take the tempo that suits it... but always keeping the energy of drum'n'bass underlying it.\u201d 2015 saw Dan add another hit to his already burgeoning back catalogue, working with MOBO and Brit award singing songstress Ella Eyre. \u2018Gravity\u2019 stormed into the official singles charts in February, peaking at number 4 and has gone on to sell over 400k records to date, plus has stacked up over 14 million views on the official video. Following this we saw the release of single \u2018Believer\u2019 with acclaimed DJ/producer Adam F, and subsequently \u2018How Love Begins\u2019, his second collaboration with legendary MC Dizzee Rascal. With over 3 million record sales, two number 1 singles and a further two top 6 singles to his name, he is infectiously optimistic about the next phase of his career, seeing the current climate as being \u201cas open-minded as those very first days of rave, back in 1990 or whenever, when I started to get what it was really about\u201d. Refusing as ever to fit anyone's expectations, and always driven by that idea of diverse minds uniting under a musical banner, he's not resting on his reputation but still pushing forward \u2013 still Fresh after all these years.", "otherInfo": "Murs + The Grouch + Eligh with DJ Fresh"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "Eligh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11488610.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.866356550000006, -122.26720543808051], "Date": "2021-07-08", "EventDate": "Jul. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Genre Bending,Hip Hop,,", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "Eligh, a self-described \u201cgenre-breaking, obsessive bass fiend\u201d has continued to sustain himself as a salient figure for over fifteen years within the increasingly fickle and rapidly revolving world of hip-hop. The Los Angeles native has maintained his respected status by fearlessly veering from a the traditional trajectory which is often limited to beats and rhymes. Instead, Eligh has chosen to fabricate projects that incorporate the gritty sounds of the UK dub scene, the unorthodox styling of indie rock, the lush guitars and honesty of folk music, and the complexity of jazz, all without losing the listener in a musically esoteric composition. 2018 will mark the release of Eligh's 10th official solo album. His last self produced album, Grey Crow, was a testament to his resilience against a drug addiction that nearly took his life 12 years ago. Grey Crow was the first official solo release from Eligh since 2003\u2019s Poltergeist. Even with the seven-year gap between solo projects Eligh continued to contribute to a plethora of projects within that time frame which, most notably include, Living Legends albums, \u201cClassic\u201d and \u201cThe Gathering\u201d; The Grouch & Eligh, \u201cNo More Greener Grasses\u201d and \u201cSay G&E!\u201d; Eligh & Jo Wilkinson, \u201cOn Sacred Ground: Mother & Son\u201d, and many more. Eligh\u2019s musical interest was piqued as middle schooler, and along with some friends formed the now defunct, yet legendary Log Cabin crew. That same crew would ultimately end up producing many of Los Angeles\u2019s prominent hip-hop figures, including future crewmates, Murs and Scarub. After a stint in the Bay Area, which lead to a serendipitous gathering of minds, ideas and styles that formed the now world famous Living Legends crew, Eligh returned home to Los Angeles. Since returning home, Eligh has tirelessly produced classic material, being the main contributor to what many would dub the trademark, \u201cLiving Legends sound\u201d. Outside of being a studio musician and rapper, Eligh has relentlessly toured and has performed on stages across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and continues to deliver a captivating live show with his trademark rapid fire delivery, whether as a solo act or with his Legendary brethren. As a producer, Eligh has provided music for notable acts such as Living Legends, Murs, Rass Kass, El-P, wrestler John Cena, and continues to be a sought after producer by his peers. In 2016, \"Grand Tapestry\" was released. A group formed by Eligh, Alam Khan, and Salar Nader, Grand Tapestry is a unique mix of classical Indian music, and hip hop, in line with Eligh's \"Genre breaker\" moniker. That journey is just beginning, and he see's the groups potential as limitless. His goal to score film had always been apart of his story, and Eligh hopes to speak it into existence in the coming months.", "otherInfo": "Murs + The Grouch + Eligh with DJ Fresh"}, {"Address": "2367 Shattuck Ave,, Berkeley, CA 94704", "Artist": "The Grouch & Eligh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6374551.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.866356550000006, -122.26720543808051], "Date": "2021-07-08", "EventDate": "Jul. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip-hop,Hip Hop,,", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cornerstone", "moreBioInfo": "\"Eligh\" & \"The Grouch\" are both members of the underground hip hop group Living Legends.

The group became friends with Mystik Journeymen, and joined them in the Living Legends collective in 1996. His solo debut album, F'Real, was released on Veritech in 1997. Alongside Slug, Murs has been part of the group Felt since 2002. The End of the Beginning, his debut album on Definitive Jux, was released in 2003. Murs released Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition, an album entirely produced by 9th Wonder, in 2004. Taking a more thoughtful approach than gangster rappers, it prompted Andy Gill of The Independent to say \"eschewing bogus glamour for emotional realism, Murs manages to say more about the corrosive cancer of hip-hop's gun culture than all the thousands of column inches lavished on 50 Cent's bullet wounds\". After another collaborative album with 9th Wonder, Murray's Revenge, in 2006, Murs signed a contract with Warner Bros., his debut album for the label being Murs for President. It was preceded by Sweet Lord which was given away free to fans. Murs released Varsity Blues 2, a follow-up to his Varsity Blues EP, with production duties handled by Aesop Rock, Terrace Martin and Droop-E in 2011. He released This Generation, a collaborative album with Fashawn, in 2012. Murs was invited by Sacha Jenkins, a hip hop journalist, to join the group The White Mandingos, a collaboration between Jenkins and Bad Brains bassist Daryl Jenifer. They released their first album, The Ghetto is Tryna Kill Me, on June 11, 2013 under the Fat Beats record label. Murs has stated that the recording is a loose concept album about a man from the hood who struggles to maintain his identity while recording as a rock artist. The band members have acknowledged that the album is partially based on their own experiences. On February 7, 2014, it was announced via Tech N9ne's Facebook page that Murs was signed to his record label Strange Music. Later that year, Murs teamed up with fellow Strange Music members Mayday! to drop the !Mursday\u00a1 album as his first release on the label. He then released Have a Nice Life on May 18, 2015, Captain California on March 10, 2017 and A Strange Journey into the Unimaginable on his birthday in 2018 all through Strange Music.

Around '91/'92 Del tha Funkee Homosapien and the Hieroglyphics crew were first starting to make noise in the bay and it was then that he felt he could really make something out of this music thing. He had a friend who rapped who convinced The Grouch to start writing/rapping in '94. He met the Mystik Journeymen soon after and they schooled him on the independent hustle. It was on. The Grouch's first show as an MC was in 1995, it was at one the Journeymen's \"Broke Ass Summer Jam\" shows in East Oakland. At that time he performed under his real name and the crowd showed him much love, which he says is the main reason he stuck with making music. The Grouch's music influences include all the hip-hop greats from LL Cool J to the Beastie Boys along with the Bay Area classics and jazz, rock, and soul music.

This national touring act, blends Country, Folk, Blues, Honky-Tonk & Rock into his own upbeat & tongue-in-cheek \"JonEmery Style\" of Roots Americana Music with stories of Highways, Heartaches and Hangovers!  The Story Born by redneck hippies, JonEmery has spent his whole life as a music enthusiast. His passion for the Americana Roots Movement of Johnny Cash, Ryan Adams, Fred Eaglesmith, The Mother Hips and countless others paved the way of his inspiration but, it wasn't until he heard Two Dollar Pistol's \"Step Right Up\" did he find his voice, style and direction. Honky-Tonk! In it's most raw form. From there, JonEmery adopted the wordsmith stylings of Hank Thompson & Jerry Reed and blended it with the classic 70's sound of George Jones & Johnny Paycheck. For a decade, he charged forward, not just as a solid entertainer with a toothy smile but, as a prolific and clever song writer. JonEmery would perform 3 hour shows of nothing but fun, engaging, original material to roaring and appreciative crowds from 1 to 1000; opening for, and performing along with, some of the biggest national and regional names in the Independent Country Music Scene. Now, JonEmery has struck out on his own, re-branding and revisiting his Americana roots. He has found a new voice, created his own - up beat & tongue-in-cheek- \"JonEmery Style\" in the direction and tradition of Country/Folk&Blues, without abandoning his Honky-Tonk foundation. JonEmery is, without a shadow of a doubt, a maverick in the Independent Music Industry of epic proportions. The History JonEmery began his career in Sonoma County with the CowPunk Band \"JonEmery & The Heartbroken\" but after a near fatal gall stone surgery, he found himself back in Sacramento, Ca. The place he spent his high school years and young adult life. Hopped up on pain meds and broke, JonEmery found opportunity in the form of ex-Ghost Of Wyoming members J-Lee Lewis, Russell Ryan and Harley Lee Walker. Dry County Drinkers were born and taking the Sacramento Valley, Sonoma County and Seattle by storm. In its 5 year inception, \"The Drinkers\" found themselves opening up for Country Music Legends David Allan Coe, Reckless Kelly, Whitey Morgan and Chuck Mead and teaming up with Regional Icons Red Meat, The Pine Box Boys, Miss Lonely Hearts and The Ganges River Band . Earned respect from Outlaw Uprisers Outlaw Bob Wayne, Hellbound Glory and Joe Buck Yourself. They even found themselves on some unsuspecting and surprising bills with The Supersuckers, Moonshine Bandits,Josh Gracin and Alien Ant Farm. Dry County Drinkers had quite a revolving door of musicians and a few DEMO CDs after the original members, one by one, went back to their more respectable and responsible lives. The \"If You Aint Drunk...\" EP found some moderate success with the single \"If You Ain't Drunk (You're With The Terrorists) supported and played by Mojo Nixon on Sirius Outlaw Country. One Drink, One Smoke, One Song - The self produced sophomore effort with more heart than heat, spawned internet radio single\"Jukebox & A Drink\" and crowd-pleaser \"Britney Spears & Beers\". You Gotta Lotta Nerve found the original Drinker line-up in the studio with 8 tracks written by J-Lee that features \"Don't Call Me Up When You're Drunk\", \"Francine\" and \"Take My Wife (please)\" and the final release, From Wine To The Whiskey which is a collection of songs from the fore mentioned releases that also includes 5 tracks from the shelved \"Leavin' Whiskey In The Bottle\" CD \"Baby, I Aint Your Ticket\", \"From Wine To The Whiskey\", \"Bar Fight\", \"Leavin Whiskey In The Bottle\" and \"Shit Kickin Blues\". In the end, JonEmery was the \"Last Drinker Standing\" as he struck out performing more solo shows with the likes of Billy Don Burns and Duane Mark which led to the Dry County Drinker brand to its end. May 1st 1015 marked Dry County Drinkers 5 Year Anniversary and \"Drinker Nation\" came to a close with all 4 original members reuniting for one final show together in Sacramento, Ca. at The Hideaway with special guests and great friends The Ganges River Band and Duane Mark. JonEmery has since been touring the NorthWest scratching and scraping every penny to release \"Americana\"with up and coming country band Way Out West and Joe Carlson from The California Stars. \"Americana\" has a target release date of February 2016 with Mid-West, North West and East Coast tour legs to follow as well as homecoming full band shows. The deck is stacked and the cards are on the table for JonEmery but his perseverance, determination and unsettled will to succeed will surely see him through.

His warm vocals and authentic writing style combined with a bold grit give Chris James and the Showdowns that classic-infused deep-rooted Americana rock sound. Beginning as a local performer in Portland, Maine, James knew that he had to get his name heard in bigger cities. He left for San Francisco with nothing more than a guitar in hand to find work. Eventually, he joined forces with The Showdowns, a Bay Area-based group comprised of Matt Berg (drums), AJ Leighton (bass), John Paterson (keys), and Whitt Vicena (lead guitar). The unity amongst the band can be felt at every show through their synergized performances. Songs from their debut album, Lucky Breaks, and music from James\u2019 solo work have been played generously on SiriusXM Radio, radio stations throughout California, and placed in TV commercial promos. Chris James and the Showdowns\u2019 second album, Somewhere out in California, is authentic, dance-driven, heartfelt, and has been getting loads of attention from various media outlets. They have a packed tour schedule for the rest of the year, including full band and solo performances. Driving down the open road can get us lost in our thoughts when surrounded by the right views and accompanied by the right music. The title track off the album, \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d begins with an acoustic guitar solo then joined by elegant piano keys. The intimate video is characterized by the natural beauty of California: the views, the ocean, and the forests. \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d is the narration of a restless heart, reminiscing on all the possible \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. Every day we are forced to make hundreds of choices, big and small. After making a decision we sometimes have afterthoughts, imagining how life would be if different decisions were made and if different things were said. The lyric, \u201cDid you ever feel like we missed the bus\u201d is the metaphorical concern of making the wrong choices in the past and missing prime opportunities or possible new adventures. It is essential to remind ourselves to take risks: if not, we will regret all the possibilities that could\u2019ve been. --\"James' style of writing is hard to deny as it rings of times and life situations we can all relate to.

Joy & Madness brings a modern classic pop sensibility to a new age of joyous funk and soul reaching audiences in a way that few live performers can. As true believers in music as a shared experience that can simultaneously allow escape and connection, Joy and Madness brings a live performance which leaves everybody inspired, sweaty, and full of joy. Joy & Madness began with 5 core members who met in a previous Sacramento project with roots in funk and soul music. With the addition of three more members, the band began experimenting with the beginnings of what would become the Joy & Madness sound; a raucous mix of raw stonesy energy, pulsing groove, and juicy horn lines coloring tightly crafted songs. Since then, they\u2019ve shared the stage with performers as prolific as Tower of Power, Trombone Shorty, and Collective Soul. Front man and vocalist Hans Eberbach brings so much freewheeling energy to the stage, he has literally broken right through the floorboards. His raw, open connection with the audience breaks down barriers and pulls everyone together into the excitement of the experience. The band\u2019s EP, Little Bright World was released to broad critical acclaim in 2015, winning an Independent Music Award among many others and receiving play-time on terrestrial and internet radio stations around the world.

It\u2019s with that spirit that they debut \u201cHeart Shaped Box,\u201d the first new music from the band since 2017, and the first single off their upcoming full-length, Explorer. The song began as a fun cover the band put together on a whim, on a rare day off on tour, according to bassist Jonathan Kirchner. But the track soon took on a life of its own \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find time to write on the road, and we were fighting a bit of a lull creatively,\u201d says Kirchner. \u201cI figured arranging a cover would be a fun exercise and a nice reminder that, yes, we are good at this \u2014 we just needed to get out of our own way.\u201d Choosing a Nirvana song was a no-brainer, says singer Ziek McCarter. The band had been experimenting with grunge for while, incorporating Soundgarden\u2019s \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d into their live shows, and loved the feeling of working with something out of their usual soul-funk-R&B wheelhouse. \u201cWe were reflecting on how many musicians we\u2019d lost from that era, this scene that inspired so many of us,\u201d says McCarter. \u201cAnd we wanted to honor them.\u201d As a playful yet potent tribute to Kurt Cobain, the song builds on a sexy, spacious bass and electric guitar rhythm, building to a blast of horns and a smart, slinky synth line, all topped by McCarter\u2019s powerful falsetto. It only took a couple hours to arrange, but within weeks \u201cHeart Shaped Box\u201d had become one of the most exciting, crowd-pleasing moments in the band\u2019s live show. Plus, it worked: \u201cIt really did kickstart things,\u201d says Kirchner. \u201cWithin a month we had two more new songs, and we were on our way to a full-length.\u201d Explorer, out July 6th, is Con Brio\u2019s hotly anticipated sophomore LP, a follow-up to their critically acclaimed 2016 debut Paradise. Showcasing a newly layered, contemporary production style, the record represents an impressive leap for the group PopMatters calls \u201cthe best new live band in America.\u201d Con Brio will tour the U.S. and Europe in support of Explorer throughout the remainder of 2018", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}]
