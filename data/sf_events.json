This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor. She encourages them to follow their dreams to sing freely and wholeheartedly. -Written by Elle K. Productions 9x award-winning R&B/Soul music artist.

Made from years of traveling the world and honing his craft and moving effortlessly through several musical genres without a single tune sounding the same. Seriously good songwriting that\u2019s augmented by what many are calling the best seven piece band in New York. All led by Chapell - Mephistopheles outfitted in a well-tailored white linen suit. Growing up on the \u201cmean streets\u201d of Stamford, Connecticut, Alan Chapell was something of a musical wunderkind - playing piano and trumpet before the age of six. He recorded with the legendary Jimmy Ienner at age 15, and more recently with Talking Head Jerry Harrison. He\u2019s played to jam-packed houses around the world from Mumbai to Managua. It took Chapell a while to get here, but audiences across the U.S. are starting to take notice in a big way. Chapell\u2019s band includes Lorenza Ponce on violin, Ann Klein on guitar, Ali Culotta on piano, Malcom Gold on bass and Rodney Howard on drums. Ponce plays a variety of delicious retro-synth lines which both play off of and play with Klein\u2019s guitar work. There are multiple moving parts that all go together a bit differently depending on the song (and Chapell\u2019s mood.) Chapell\u2019s live show is a cacophony of juxtapositions. His set moves seamless from genre to genre and from topic to topic. From songs about love to songs about more heady topics such as gun violence and human rights. And finally, to a parody of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent Congressional testimony. With all that, Chapell somehow manages to keep things fun \u2013 not to mention you are guaranteed to leave the night with at least a few of Chapell\u2019s melodies stuck in your head. On making music in 2019 Chapell now says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m discovering myself as an artist in a way I never could have earlier in my life. For too long, I bought into the notion that I couldn\u2019t become a successful artist in my 30\u2019s \u2013 and it was liberating to recognize how foolish that was. The most invigorating thing is that I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve written my best song yet. I know who I am now and I am excited that I am nowhere close to my peak.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Alan Chapell plays a special solo concert at Live Bait in Sausalito (next to the world famous Fish Restaurant)"}, {"Address": "350 Harbor Drive, Sausalito, CA 94965", "Artist": "Alan Chapell ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.8680978, -122.4976978], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bait in Sausalito", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "San Mateo, CA", "Artist": "John Elliott ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11502415.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.5629917, -122.3255254], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Back Forty", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.thehereafterishere.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "Gravenstein Hwy S, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Anna Moss & the Nightshades ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11433452.jpeg", "Coordinates": [38.3921302, -122.8175568], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "New Family Farm", "moreBioInfo": "New Orleans, bedroom pop.

His warm vocals and authentic writing style combined with a bold grit give Chris James and the Showdowns that classic-infused deep-rooted Americana rock sound. Beginning as a local performer in Portland, Maine, James knew that he had to get his name heard in bigger cities. He left for San Francisco with nothing more than a guitar in hand to find work. Eventually, he joined forces with The Showdowns, a Bay Area-based group comprised of Matt Berg (drums), AJ Leighton (bass), John Paterson (keys), and Whitt Vicena (lead guitar). The unity amongst the band can be felt at every show through their synergized performances. Songs from their debut album, Lucky Breaks, and music from James\u2019 solo work have been played generously on SiriusXM Radio, radio stations throughout California, and placed in TV commercial promos. Chris James and the Showdowns\u2019 second album, Somewhere out in California, is authentic, dance-driven, heartfelt, and has been getting loads of attention from various media outlets. They have a packed tour schedule for the rest of the year, including full band and solo performances. Driving down the open road can get us lost in our thoughts when surrounded by the right views and accompanied by the right music. The title track off the album, \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d begins with an acoustic guitar solo then joined by elegant piano keys. The intimate video is characterized by the natural beauty of California: the views, the ocean, and the forests. \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d is the narration of a restless heart, reminiscing on all the possible \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. Every day we are forced to make hundreds of choices, big and small. After making a decision we sometimes have afterthoughts, imagining how life would be if different decisions were made and if different things were said. The lyric, \u201cDid you ever feel like we missed the bus\u201d is the metaphorical concern of making the wrong choices in the past and missing prime opportunities or possible new adventures. It is essential to remind ourselves to take risks: if not, we will regret all the possibilities that could\u2019ve been. --\"James' style of writing is hard to deny as it rings of times and life situations we can all relate to. It's nice to see an artist and band like the Showdowns hold true to Americana roots while still giving you a rock and roll kick in the ass!\" -Starita (Producer - Trevor Hall, Tribe Called Quest) --\"Chris is a singer-songwriter with an honest approach and style that really speaks to everyday people...\" - J.

In its five-year existence, the band has released one previous full length, one EP, and toured nationally and internationally, selling out venues along the West Coast and throughout the United Kingdom. Select career live performance highlights include performing at Outsidelands Festival, Bottlerock, and the Maverick Festival, where despite being at the bottom of the bill, the group managed to sell more CDs than any other artist in the festival's history. They\u2019ve opened for such diverse artists as Shakey Graves, Deer Tick, Martin Sexton, and Kaki King. In addition, they\u2019ve been featured on NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition, and the band\u2019s beloved track, \"Cold Canary Gaslight,\" from its 2014 studio debut album, Pray for Rain, has currently surpassed passed one million Spotify listens. Marty\u2019s blues epiphany came from a somewhat hilarious turn of events when, as a teenager, he tried to download a hip hop track on Napster, but accidently downloaded Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s \u201cLet Your Light Shine On Me.\u201d It was indeed a fateful mistake. Marty saw an avenue of expression for his teen angst in the simple 3-chord structures and earthy melodies of the blues, and dove headfirst into the tradition. \u201cI was dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally at the time, and I would sit in my bedroom, play guitar, and listen to old blues for hours. My parents would leave food for me outside my door,\u201d Marty recalls, laughing. \u201cThere was something both angry and calming about that music that resonated with me. That music was my place to get away from all my troubles.\u201d Later, Marty\u2019s father, a voracious music lover, hipped him to John Fahey\u2019s The Yellow Princess (Vanguard Records, 1968), and that record illuminated the possibilities one could explore with roots music. \u201cI felt like that record had one foot in blues and American folk music, and one foot somewhere else,\u201d Marty explains. That John Fahey record\u2019s lesson would play a part in the evolution of the Old Soul Orchestra from reverent traditionalists to Americana adventurers, as evidenced by Stereoscope. The album represents the maturation of artists shedding hero worship and embracing the creativity within. These new frontiers are characterized by a heartfelt purity in Marty\u2019s vocals, the tracks\u2019 unique and richly expressive chord structures and progressions, a shift in narrative perspectives to a more observational bend, and emotionally dynamic arrangements that are beautifully arresting, often beginning with sparse simplicity and then reaching lush and fully orchestrated climaxes with sensitive group interplay. The 11-song album opens with \u201cFirmament,\u201d which eases in with delicately eerie ambience and sparse musical accompaniment, revealing all the soulful nuances and inflections in Marty\u2019s voice. The song soars forward with an impactful arrangement as the full band joins in with rich and varied musicality, including a dazzling drum and percussive break and a violin solo as brilliantly fractured as a cubist painting. The album\u2019s third track, the haunting \u201cGhost,\u201d is a swampy ambient blues that uses the phenomena of sleep paralysis as an intriguing metaphor for vulnerability. The standout album single \u201cOff and On Again\u201d offers sweet yearning for a d\u00e9tente after a lover\u2019s quarrel. Other album highlights include a rendition of Skip James\u2019 blues classic \u201cHard Time Killing Floor\u201d with chillingly beautiful new music to accompany the haunting traditional lyrics, and the three stirring, but challenging, instrumentally-driven songs that conclude the album and recall fringe jazz guitarist\u2019s Bill Frisell\u2019s evocations of dustbowl Americana with futuristic ambience. Stereoscope is no doubt a milestone entry for Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra, offering forth the band\u2019s most assured and mature release to date. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into this album,\u201d shares Marty. \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make\u2014one that ten years later I can still be proud of. Making it has made me feel whole, and brought me a lot of joy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4100 Monterey Hwy, San Jose, CA 95122", "Artist": "Los Morros del Norte ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.2794835, -121.8341096], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Event Center La Ceiba", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "44 Race St, San Jose, CA 95126", "Artist": "Starover Blue ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11421667.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.3305076, -121.9116715], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Experimental, Experimental Alternative, Shoegaze, Indie, Dream Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Starover Blue Live Online Concert from Art Boutiki", "moreBioInfo": "The nostalgic tones of a Juno 106 combine with ambient layers, sparkling guitars, and airy, bittersweet vocals to define Portland experimental dream pop band Starover Blue.

Diez a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, las ventas millonarias de discos tales como: \u201cRAMA SECA\u201d, \u201cTU MIRADA\u201d, \u201cDE DURANGO A CHICAGO\u201d, \u201cEN VIVO DESDE CHICAGO\u201d, \u201cY SIGUE LA MATA DANDO\u201d entre otros, respaldan el impresionante \u00e9xito de MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO que ha impuesto un estilo en la m\u00fasica, la manera de bailar y vestir. El tema \u201cRama Seca\u201d es el que les abre las puertas de la disquera BMG, la cual los firma y les produce su primer disco del mismo nombre. \u201cTU MIRADA\u201d es el t\u00edtulo de su segunda producci\u00f3n que tambi\u00e9n es grabada bajo el sello de BMG. Su tercer disco titulado \u201cLA AUSENCIA\u201d fue el primero que grabaron para su propio sello Terrazas Records, marcando con \u00e9ste, lo que ser\u00eda el inicio de sus m\u00faltiples \u00e9xitos. Posteriormente, para cuando grabaron el disco \u201cLOS PRIMOS DE BALTAZAR\u201d; el grupo ya empezaba a figurar como un fen\u00f3meno musical, rompiendo r\u00e9cords de taquilla en sus presentaciones. \u201cCON SABOR A TAMBORAZO\u201d, fue su quinta producci\u00f3n con la que inmediatamente acapararon la atenci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico, anim\u00e1ndose a grabar su sexto disco totalmente en vivo. Despu\u00e9s de 6 producciones, Jos\u00e9 Luis Terrazas acepta la invitaci\u00f3n que la disquera transnacional Disa Latin Music le hace para formar parte de su elenco, grabando de inmediato el primer disco para este sello titulado \u201cEL SUBE Y BAJA\u201d. Demostrando que el pasito duranguense no era exclusivo de la ciudad de los vientos, se lanz\u00f3 en octubre del 2003, el disco \u201cDE DURANGO A CHICAGO\u201d, s\u00f3lo superado en las listas de Billboard por el \u00e1lbum \u201c33\u201d de Luis Miguel. Para el a\u00f1o 2004, en agradecimiento a la ciudad que los vio formarse musicalmente, grabaron el disco titulado \u201cEN VIVO DESDE CHICAGO\u201d, el cual debut\u00f3 en la posici\u00f3n n\u00famero uno de Billboard. Tanto es el auge de la onda duranguense, que Disa decidi\u00f3 realizar un producto especial con varios artistas del g\u00e9nero, sin embargo; la peculiaridad de esta producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cQUE CHIDO! EL PASITO DURANGUENSE\u201d es la magistral participaci\u00f3n que tiene MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO. Previo a lanzar en el 2005 su producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO particip\u00f3 de manera especial en un disco titulado \u201cLAS MAS BAILABLES DEL PASITO DURANGUENSE.

M\u00e1s vivos que nunca y disfrutando de un \u00e9xito sin precedente en cada presentaci\u00f3n, MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO decide lanzar tambi\u00e9n en el 2005, otras dos producciones discogr\u00e1ficas de \u00e9xitos, la primera titulada \u201cVIVE\u201d y la segunda que sali\u00f3 para cerrar el a\u00f1o con el nombre de \u201cLOS S\u00daPER \u00c9XITOS LAGRIMILLAS TONTAS\u201d, en el que incluyen como bonus track el \u00e9xito \u201cLagrimillas tontas\u201d. En el 2006, la agrupaci\u00f3n sigui\u00f3 cosechando triunfos y es as\u00ed que su casa disquera saca a la venta varias producciones, la primera de ellas denominada \u201c500 NOVILLOS\u201d, un disco que caus\u00f3 furor a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, pero lo presentan de una manera totalmente fresca y renovada, aprovechando los nuevos avances tecnol\u00f3gicos de la actualidad. Este \u00e1lbum le da paso a los \u201c\u00c9XITOS EN VIVO\u201d, producci\u00f3n que recopila los grandes \u00e9xitos que la agrupaci\u00f3n ha tenido a lo largo de su carrera, sigui\u00e9ndole tambi\u00e9n \u201cGRUPO MONT\u00c9Z E INVITADOS\u201d y \u201cLOS S\u00daPER \u00c9XITOS 2 ADI\u00d3S A MI AMANTE\u201d.

La sorpresa musical fue sin lugar a dudas, la incursi\u00f3n de la agrupaci\u00f3n al g\u00e9nero Pop, ya que aparte de sobresalir con el tema \u201cMe duele escuchar tu nombre\u201d en la versi\u00f3n duranguense, se arriesgaron a grabar la versi\u00f3n Pop de esta melod\u00eda consiguiendo de inmediato, resultados inimaginables.

The Avengers were formed in San Francisco, in the first wave of American Punk. Penelope Houston was the lead singer, primary songwriter, and her persona was a large part of the draw for the act. The other band members were James Wilsey (bass), D. Furious (drums), and Greg Ingraham (guitar). Critic Greil Marcus once said The Avengers were, \"...San Francisco's best punk band - in their moments, they were, you knew, better than any other band playing that night anywhere in the world.\" The Avengers gained much publicity when they opened for the Sex Pistols in San Francisco, for their legendary final show at Winterland. The Avengers' 4-song EP was also produced by Steve Jones (of the Sex Pistols) in 1979 on White Noise Records. Their discography also contains an earlier 3-song EP (on Dangerhouse Records) from 1977, a full album called \"The Avengers\" from 1981, a compilation of unreleased tracks and outtakes called \"The Avengers Died for Your Sins\" in 1999 on Lookout! Records, and a second compilation titled \"The American in Me\" on DBK Works (2004). Houston and Ingraham have reunited and currently perform as The Avengers with bassist Joel Reader (MXT, Pansy Division) and drummer Luis Illades (Pansy Division) touring the US and Europe. 2. Perhaps the first band to be called The Avengers was an American group from Bakersfield, California. The first incarnation came together in 1964, as a surf six-piece. Where the name came from is unknown, but the hip British TV series 'The Avengers' had started running on the BBC two years earlier. The group soon latched on to the new sound of the British Invasion and bands like The Beatles, but also American acts like Paul Revere & the Raiders and The Music Machine. Between 1965 and 1967 The Avengers released five 45s and played support slots for the likes of The Beach Boys, The Animals, The Seeds and The Music Machine. They didn't have a hit, but their song \"Be a Caveman\" has become legendary in garage circuits for having the sort of lyric you'd think everyone would write but never really did. Other songs that have turned up on garage compilations are \"It's Hard to Hide\" and its b-side \"Open Your Eyes\". The Avengers had unusually short hair, because they were still in school and were afraid to get suspended. 3. Another early band named The Avengers were based in Wellington, New Zealand and were active from 1966 until 1969. They had a string of top ten hits on the New Zealand charts, with the most successful, \"Love, Hate, Revenge\", reaching #2 in August 1968. Overseas, however, they had considerably less success and they broke up after their second tour of Australia. During their career, they released two albums, Electric Recording in 1968 and Medallion in 1969, as well as a live album in 1968. In 2001, almost all of their studio material was collected on one compilation that also appeared under the name Electric Recording.", "otherInfo": "Ivy Room Presents \n**MASKS REQUIRED**"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Ryan Andrews ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "BOOTIE MASHUP: BOOTIE-CON\nMain Room:\n Adriana A\n DJ Tyme\nGeek-inspired pole dance show by:\n Flux Vertical Theatre\nLounge:\n Ryan Andrews\nThis week is virtual Comic-Con International, so Adriana A and DJ Tyme are geeking out with mashups from our favorite sci-fi and fantasy films, TV shows, and videogames, including a special geektastic pole dance show at 11:11 from Flux Vertical Theatre.

It was her passion and her sensitivity through her vocals that he learned the subtleties and nuance that could be expressed through song. By the age of 7, he displayed great acumen as a musician by mastering the ancient Persian Percussion instrument, the Tombac. However even more fascinating than his prodigious instrumentation, was the way in which he began to sing at such a range of octaves that he had almost absorbed the subtleties and power of the Tombac used for centuries as a storytelling device. Indeed, it was rare to hear a male voice that had such distinct high and low octaves usually reserved for those rare voices. Upon seeing him perform he was invited to learn the ancient musical techniques from a group of dedicated musicians who mentored him for several years. By the age of 12, he added violin to his repertoire and with an unquenchable thirst and natural talent it wasn\u2019t long before he embraced the piano and the guitar. His sense of ownership of the instruments he played and his unusual vocal abilities led to composing music tailored to his own sensibilities as a musician and artist. Performing has taken on new hues recently and he through acting he was recently featured in the lead role in a short film directed by Yancey Arias, appropriately entitled, \"Success Driven\u201d. The film which was written by Scott J. Foster also features actors, Steven Bauer and Serena Scott Thomas. The charming story while fictional is based on a character not unlike Mohammad and explores a young man\u2019s journey from Iran to Hollywood on his quest to find success and fame as a singer in Hollywood. With a Fall 2012 release, the producers are confident to platform the film through Sundance, Cannes and other prestigious competitions and festivals world-wide. To coincide with the film, Mr. Molaei will release his first single produced by Elan Morrisson, in which he wrote the music and provides the vocals with lyrics by Scott J. Foster. The single is feathered through the film as the soundtrack. Couturier Lloyd Klein most recently encouraged Mr. Molaei to model for his new Menswear Campaign also set to launch in Fall of 2012 and has been photographed by the very talented lens man Robert Voltaire for that campaign.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium. McKee\u2019s tour dates have taken him through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, including tours with legendary acts from Dream Theater to Tommy Emmanuel.", "otherInfo": "This is Andy McKee's Guitar Camp featuring Yvette Young, Guitaro 5000, Trevor Gordon Hall, and special guest Michael Manring. its 4 days of workshops, lessons, and intimate performances.

He moved continuously until his teenage years, where he settled in Sonoma County. Presti played in a hardcore band, releasing several albums and touring extensively until they broke up. His identity shifted as he rediscovered his love for acoustic guitar and eventually moved to San Francisco. He\u2019s gone on several west coast tours, and played shows at the Lagunitas Brewery, Napa City Winery, HopMonk Tavern and Brick and Mortar Music Hall and has shared the stage with national artists like Grammy Nominated Gretchen Peters, Little Tybee, The Deer and Elliott Peck.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family filled with performers. Toree's musical style embodies elements of her influences, ranging from the soulful country sounds of The Judds and Bonnie Raitt, to the rock of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Aerosmith, and especially the engrossing vocals of Janis Joplin. McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. McGee recorded tracks for the EP in 2014 at Ronnie's Place in Nashville, alongside seasoned musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d Toree's first single, \"Amen\" gained airplay on radio stations in California, the midwest, and Canada, and climbed to the #1 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment for several days in a row. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which have featured her music and story. She most recently co-wrote and recorded brand new songs with hard hitting guitar riffs and tons of girl power attitude, and released her first full-length album on Valentine\u2019s Day 2020 . Her first single from the project, named \u201cLipstick\u201d is currently in rotation at KRTY as well as on Sirius/XM\u2019s station \u2018The Pulse\u2019.

Her first full EP was officially released in 2015, and her first full-length album was released in February 2020.

Formed in 2013, the band is headed by front man Chris Crabb and supported by Alex Palazzo, David Maemone - Keys, Frank Ojeda-bass, and Jay Tibbitts-drums. The Strike released their debut album \"Faint of Heart\" in June of 2017, which was met with great enthusiasm nationally. The success of the record allowed them to expand their presence into Los Angeles and the greater Mountain West region and has put them on the radar as one of the up and coming bands to watch for. On August 17th 2018, their song \u201cHuman Right\u201d from the album was featured in Netflix\u2019s original movie \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d In less than one month, the song was streamed over 1 million times on Spotify alone, and well over a million times across all platforms. It was \u201cShazamed\u201d over 20k times in the month following the release of the movie. Among those who saved Human Right to their library, it is listened to at an average of 10+ times. It was featured on Spotify\u2019s New Alt Playlist (700k+ subscribers), as well as the US Viral Top 50 Chart. In the summer of 2017, they were selected to play at the 27th annual Qingdao Beer Festival in China where they performed to thousands of festival goers for a month and a half. Their music is now being circulated across Asia. In early 2018 The Strike was hand selected by Quincy Jones to play a three month residency at Q's Bar and Lounge in Dubai. There they were able to win over fans from all over the globe. They played 60 shows in 82 days while in the UAE. The Strike is known for their captivating live performances. In an age of musical minimalism, The Strike is reminiscent of rock bands from the 70's and 80's. They feature true showmanship in an age where the art of performance has been forgotten.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium. McKee\u2019s tour dates have taken him through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, including tours with legendary acts from Dream Theater to Tommy Emmanuel.", "otherInfo": "This is Andy McKee's Guitar Camp featuring Andy along with Mike Dawes, Antoine Dufour, Calum Graham, Trevor Gordon Hall, Muriel Anderson, and Michael Manring."}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "BIT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6373397.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-26", "EventDate": "Jul. 26th, 2021", "Genre": "Psy Trance, Goa Trance, Electronic", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DEATH GUILD\nMain Room:\n Decay\n Joe Radio\n Melting Girl\nLounge:\n Sage\n Bit\nDeath Guild is the oldest weekly goth/industrial dance night in the world!

But at the age of 14, Jake Shimabukuro realized that he was doing something a little different with the four-stringed instrument \u2013 OK, a lot different. Shimabukuro\u2019s wholly unique approach to the ukulele started early. As a youngster growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii, Shimabukuro started playing the instrument at the age of four, learning the basics from his mother, Carol, and then developing his craft further by studying the likes of musical masters such as Eddie Kamae, Ohta-San and Peter Moon. As he matured, Shimabukuro also found inspiration from guitar players, drummers, pianists, and singers. Even athletes helped fuel the intensity of his artistic fire. In 2005, Shimabukuro\u2019s touring career really came to life with a video on YouTube. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was at the time, so I was totally surprised when people started telling me they\u2019d seen a video of me playing \u2018While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBefore I got a chance to check it out myself, the video had gone viral and a lot of music industry folks seemed to know about it.

Shimabukuro\u2019s records have topped the Billboard World Music Charts on numerous occasions, and as a live performer he has become one of the hottest tickets around. He\u2019s played with world-renowned orchestras and at prestigious venues such as the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center and the Sydney Opera House, and has dazzled audiences at music festivals including Bonnaroo, SXSW, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Fuji Rock Festival. He even performed for that rarest of audiences: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Not too shabby for a humble young man from Hawaii and his trusty ukulele. Even with the constant demands on his time \u2013 Shimabukuro tours roughly half the year and makes frequent appearances on media outlets such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien, A Prairie Home Companion and NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2013 Shimabukuro\u2019s album output hasn\u2019t slowed. In 2016, he recorded the all-original Nashville Sessions at Music City\u2019s famed Ronnie\u2019s Place studio with producer R.S. Field (Steve Earle, Webb Wilder) and the ace rhythm section of bassist Nolan Verner and drummer Evan Hutchings. And now he\u2019s returned to the same city and studio \u2013 and with the same gang, too (augmented by guitarist Dave Preston) \u2013 for his newest record, The Greatest Day, which will be released on August 31, 2018. \u201cI had such a great time working with R.S. Field on Nashville Sessions,\u201d Shimabukuro explains, \u201cand I knew I wanted to continue working with him on The Greatest Day. On the last record, it was pretty much the sound of a live trio, which sounded fresh, raw and organic. We were basically writing and improvising in the studio. Now we\u2019ve expanded to a quartet, which has added more colors and variety to the overall production. Once we recorded the live takes, we experimented with overdubs, and added horns, strings and keys, and other funky sounds. There are even some vocals on a few cuts.\u201d The 12 tracks that comprise The Greatest Day feature some of Shimabukuro\u2019s most imaginative and adventuresome playing yet. Half of the album is devoted to originals, on which the instrumentalist reaches new heights of compositional distinction. And on the covers, Shimabukuro\u2019s prodigious skills allow him to achieve the impossible, transcending his material \u2013 no mean feat considering some of the classics and standards he\u2019s tackling. Among the self-penned tunes, there\u2019s the blissed-out title track, so effervescent and airy that it transports the listener into the clouds. Shimabukuro wrote the song the night before going into the studio. Shimabukuro, Verner and Hutchings recorded their parts first. Later, Dave Preston added a joyous, Edge-like guitar riff that really finished the tune. \u201cIt came together so quickly,\u201d Shimabukuro says, \u201cand when I heard the final mix, I just thought, \u2018Wow, this has been the greatest day!\u2019\u201d \u201cPangram\u201d has already turned heads in concert. Titled after a sentence that uses all the letters in the alphabet (\u201clike \u2018the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog\u2019\u201d), it\u2019s based on a chromatic scale that utilizes all the notes in the Western music scale. But even non-musicologists will ride happily along its rivers of cascading melodies and its pumping, rock-soul rhythms. Another treasure is \u201cStraight A\u2019s,\u201d a carefree and vibrant ride guaranteed to lift spirits, on which Shimabukuro\u2019s soulful soloing recalls one of his influences, Carlos Santana. The song was inspired by the A string on the ukulele. \u201cI wanted to write something where the \u2018A\u2019 note could ring out through the entire song.\u201d \u201cMahalo John Wayne\u201d is a flat-out stunner, a delicate melody that transforms into a grand-scale cinematic symphony. Discussing its origins, Shimabukuro explains that his father\u2019s favorite actor is John Wayne (\u201cHe named me Jake after one of the Duke\u2019s characters, in the movie \u2018Big Jake\u2019\u201d), and that the two of them would often watch Westerns together. \u201cThose are some great memories of mine,\u201d he says, \u201cso, I\u2019m saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to John Wayne for my name in this song. In Hawaiian, \u2018mahalo\u2019 means \u2018thank you.\u2019\u201d As always, Shimabukuro\u2019s playing has a wonderful quality to it \u2013 there\u2019s an innocence, as if each phrase feels new to him. This sense of discovery is abundant on his astonishing reinterpretations of songs such as the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d now re-imagined as a driving and insistent ballad, brimming with furious jazz chords and a spirited back-and-forth between Shimabukuro and dobro legend Jerry Douglas. \u201cIt was such an honor to have Jerry guest on the record,\u201d Shimabukuro says. \u201cHe was only going to play on one tune, but we had such a great time that he stayed and played on two more tracks. I hope we can do more together one day.\u201d The two go toe to toe on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s freak-flag classic \u201cIf 6 Was 9,\u201d spiraling off into a spacey, jazz-rock odyssey that manages to be reverential to the original while simultaneously distinguishing itself as a bold new tour de force. Shimabukuro\u2019s wild wah-wah lines form transfixing sheets of sound, and he even pulls off a neat trick, varying some of his melodies to recall another Hendrix standard, \u201cLittle Wing.\u201d \u201cI wanted to throw in something unexpected, because that\u2019s what I felt like Hendrix would do.\u201d The Zombies\u2019 psychedelic rock nugget \u201cTime of the Season\u201d was one Shimabukuro often heard in his house growing up, and on The Greatest Day he trips into nostalgia with an elegant rendition that features some of his smoothest, Wes Montgomery-like phrases. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play this one for my parents,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they heard it, they were like, \u2018Oh, wow! You covered the Zombies!\u2019 They thought that was pretty cool.\u201d The Greatest Day concludes on a stately note, with a sparse yet exquisite reading of Leonard Cohen\u2019s iconic hymn \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Each line that Shimabukuro plays seeps into one\u2019s heart and soul, proving that music is indeed the universal balm. \u201cI had recorded it before, but after Cohen passed I wanted to re-record it \u2013 I felt a new emotional response to it. It seemed like the perfect way to end the album.\u201d Only he didn\u2019t end it there: Shimabukuro was particularly excited about his playing on a recent round of dates with bassist Nolan Verner and guitarist Dave Preston. The addition of a guitarist allowed him to solo more expressively than ever before. The digital edition of The Greatest Day includes a beautiful live version of \u201cBlue Roses Falling\u201d that features Shimabukuro dueting with cellist Meena Cho as well as a concert recording of \u201cKawika\u201d (originally made famous by the Sunday Manoa). The CD and vinyl versions of the album include both tracks along with three more cuts including immersive takes on \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d and Shimabukuro\u2019s own \u201cDragon,\u201d. There\u2019s even a slinky, ultra-funky interpretation of Bill Withers\u2019 hit single \u201cUse Me\u201d that sees Preston showing off his soulful vocal chops. They were recorded live with no overdubs at various venues by engineer Brett Lind and mixed by Jack Clarke (who engineered Nashville Sessions and The Greatest Day). Shimabukuro has already been performing some of the material from The Greatest Day live, and he\u2019ll soon work more songs into his set. In mid-July, he embarks on an extensive tour of the U.S and a fall tour of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to play the new songs in my shows,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking this record was one of the highlights I\u2019ve had in the studio. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sounds and arrangements. But most of all, we had a ton of fun making it.\u201d Along with his tremendous professional achievements, Shimabukuro\u2019s personal life is filled with riches: He\u2019s a loving husband and proud father of two boys. While balancing career with family, he also remains firmly rooted in his commitment to community, frequently performing at schools in Hawaii and overseas, urging youngsters to find their passion and live drug-free.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Eva Noblezada ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.7860081, -122.4092959], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "444 Battery St, San Francisco, CA 94111", "Artist": "Phil Hanley ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.795486, -122.4001359], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Punch Line Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "This show is 18 & over with valid, government-issued photo ID.
