Born from the wild musical wanderings of Jason Vanderford, renowned for his five years recording and touring with gypsy jazz sensation The Hot Club of San Francisco, their energizing musical collage includes 50\u2019s rock and roll rumbling atop gypsy rhythms, a bit of Gipsy Rhumba, tango, Eastern Euro/Hungarian music, bellydance, punk\u2026Vanderford was raised on \u201crock and roll and punk and everything under the sun,\u201d so other sounds are certain to appear as the hybrid junk rockers continue their jam. The songs on their mostly vocal 2013 debut Wild Tones and predominantly instrumental follow-up Melusina (2015) have earned them comparisons to Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen, Gogol Bordello, Dead Kennedys and Tom Waits. One fan called it \u201cCrooner Punk\u201d because of Vanderford\u2019s beckoning, low range vocals \u2013 but those are just the centerpiece of a vibe that includes the singer\u2019s acoustic banjo and rhythm guitar, the polyrhythmic grooves of drummer, cajon player and group cofounder Rt Goodrich, Laela Peterson-Stolen\u2019s soaring violin and viola and the growling electric fretless bass of Tim Bush. At the heart of Junk Parlor\u2019s desire to get their audiences dancing and singing along is Vanderford\u2019s passion for storytelling. He taps into an offbeat influence for their latest single, the haunting rockabilly heartbreak tune \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart.\u201d Drawing thematic inspiration from The Rolling Stones\u2019 countrified ballad \u201cDear Doctor\u201d (which appeared on Beggar\u2019s Banquet), the band creates a fresh twist on the pain of lost love via the juxtaposition of dark lyrics and bouncy rhythms. Vanderford artfully describes the piece as what happens \u201cwhen the heartache of Leonard Cohen decides to lament under the sun amidst the California surf\u2026The moment of goodbye\u2026the lingering sigh that begs to turn back time\u2026Doctor won\u2019t you please\u2026tear it out.\u201d The compelling, gut punchingly beautiful video for the track by Jeannie Jo uses scenes of San Francisco cityscapes as a metaphor for heartbreak. Building a solid, ever expanding West Coast fan base, Junk Parlor has played several hundred gigs these past few years. Beyond a batch of hotspots in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area, the band has headlined numerous times in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Los Angeles and Reno. Aiming each time out to capture a room for a few hours, and aware of today\u2019s short musical attention spans, Vanderford always creates fresh set lists using previous tunes to frame or set the mood for the next, building waves of energy in an arc like fashion. Not surprisingly, Junk Parlor\u2019s fan base is as demographically eclectic as their music. Remembering a certain trip to Seattle, the singer says, \u201cOne night we played a punk club in Bremerton, with people wearing Mohawks and going crazy in a mosh pit, and the next we were at the Triple Door jazz club, with an older audience in suits and ties, drinking fancy martinis. The sonic shift reminds us a lot of the MTV Unplugged era, when heavy rockers gained new popularity by playing softer acoustic music.\u201d As Vanderford tells it, Junk Parlor began almost by accident. In the years since his stint with The Hot Club of San Francisco, he had emerged as one of the region\u2019s \u201cgo-to\u201d musicians for his rhythm guitar and gypsy jazz expertise. In early 2013, his uncle, Tim Bush, asked him to come play his acoustic at a wine bar in Petaluma that he tended bar at. Vanderford agreed, but only if Bush played bass. \u201cHe\u2019s been a professional bassist for 30 years and took me to buy my first guitar when I was 14,\u201d says the singer. As he got into his once a month residency, Robin Goodrich showed up, telling Vanderford he wanted to put a group together. \u201cI had never met him before, but he said he knew who I was,\u201d Vanderford says. \u201cI was hesitant but asked him to sit in with me for a few months. Then he shows up one day saying he booked the band. I told him we didn\u2019t have a name and he said we better get one. So then I took it seriously.\u201d As the idea of a larger ensemble took shape, Vanderford decided he wanted an original, more experimental band rather than another traditional gypsy jazz outfit. He began pulling out songs he had never shown anyone. The clever band name came from his younger days, when his bedroom stored his collection of vintage furniture and pictures he\u2019d bought at antique stores. He vowed then that if he ever had a band of his own, he would call it what he called that space: Junk Parlor. Adding Bush on bass, the band played their first gig that May and five months later they made their debut album Wild Tones and started touring. While the singer writes all the original songs, the band works together on the arrangements and each member writes their own parts. Vanderford and Goodrich are financial partners in the band who do everything DIY, including booking, social media, poster making and promotion. Junk Parlor's members have played the gamut of festivals and prestigious venues including Outside Lands, Kate Wolfe Fest, Djangofest, Gaia Fest and SXSW. Vanderford has played, recorded and toured with the Americano Social Club, The Hot Club of San Francisco, Clint Bakers New Orleans Jazz Band, Little Charlie's Caravan, Avatar Ensemble and Seth Ford Young Quartet. Rt Goodrich has laid down rhythms and toured with Staggerwing, Beso Negro and Standing Room Only. Bush has played extensively with Danny Montana, Sweetie Pie and the Doughboys, Chuck Day, Sam Andrew, Jim Martin, and Freddie Roulette. Wild Tones included two instrumentals that resonated with the local bellydance community. The band started getting videos of dance troupes from all over, dancing to these tracks. Kami Liddle from the Gold Star Dane Company asked Vanderford if he wanted to collaborate, and he dove into a fresh project, aiming to create an album for dancers to choreograph to. They put together a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to make Junk Parlor\u2019s instrumental dominated Melusina and go on tour with the Gold Star girls. He had been collecting vintage bellydance records for years, so he started picking out the ones he loved to learn. He recorded two covers among the originals, \u201cGold Star Dance Academy\u201d and \u201cProcession.\u201d Looking ahead, Vanderford says that the new album, which will include \u201cMick Jagger\u2019s Heart,\u201d will build upon what Junk Parlor has been doing since day one. \u201cOur first two records are simply two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cI am looking forward to our next project as we already have all the songs and have been playing them out and getting a wonderful response. This one will include a few instrumentals, but have more of an emphasis on vocals. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning through all of these recording and performing experiences is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a jazz musician, singer or dancer, the goal is always telling a great story. I love getting out there and hearing people\u2019s stories and then transforming those into songs that can be interpreted in unique ways by the band, dancers and everyone in the audience that it touches.\u201d \"A dream falling off the edge of a cliff.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "BIT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6373397.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-19", "EventDate": "Jul. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Psy Trance, Goa Trance", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "DEATH GUILD\nMain Room:\n Decay\n Joe Radio\n Melting Girl\nLounge:\n Sage\n Bit\nDeath Guild is the oldest weekly goth/industrial dance night in the world!

He moved continuously until his teenage years, where he settled in Sonoma County. Presti played in a hardcore band, releasing several albums and touring extensively until they broke up. His identity shifted as he rediscovered his love for acoustic guitar and eventually moved to San Francisco. He\u2019s gone on several west coast tours, and played shows at the Lagunitas Brewery, Napa City Winery, HopMonk Tavern and Brick and Mortar Music Hall and has shared the stage with national artists like Grammy Nominated Gretchen Peters, Little Tybee, The Deer and Elliott Peck.

Eventually, the Navarrete family moved to South San Francisco, California where he spent the rest of his childhood. He started his career in 1989 with a performance at University of California Santa Cruz.

Patti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others. Tuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz. In 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day. In 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan. That's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "Feinsteins at the Nikko is thrilled to welcome back legendary jazz duo Tuck & Patti. For 42 years this unique, genre-crossing vocal/guitar jazz duo has cast its passionate musical spell worldwide, capturing the hearts of lovers, the respect of jazz buffs and the jaw-dropping awe of guitarists and singers. To understand Tuck and Patti, start with the wellspring of love within them, then their music begins to make perfect sense. Married 39 years, Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart continue to stoke the fires, not only of their own love, but also of their love of life and their passion for making music together. They have a long-standing tradition: minimalist arrangements featuring Tuck's extraordinary virtuosity and Pattis rich mezzo soprano. Patti, renowned for her remarkable ability to touch hearts directly with her voice, exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he'll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger and producer. Without even blinking, Tuck-the-problem-solver brags, 'Patti writes and arranges; I am just the orchestra.\""}, {"Address": "510 Embarcadero W, Oakland, CA 94607", "Artist": "Mark Hummel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11359488.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7962494, -122.2785582], "Date": "2021-07-21", "EventDate": "Jul. 21st, 2021", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Yoshi's Oakland", "moreBioInfo": "Mark Hummel is a Grammy nominated Blues Music Award winning American blues harmonica player, vocalist, songwriter, and long-time bandleader of The Blues Survivors.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium. McKee\u2019s tour dates have taken him through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, including tours with legendary acts from Dream Theater to Tommy Emmanuel.", "otherInfo": "This is Andy McKee's Guitar Camp featuring Yvette Young, Guitaro 5000, Trevor Gordon Hall, and special guest Michael Manring. its 4 days of workshops, lessons, and intimate performances.

As an energetic and engaging folk band with foot stomping musical companions, the group was able to win the competition and release their first album with the winnings. In the following years, Jake got to play with many talented friends and personalities which helped mold the band\u2019s vision and created time to grow in tasteful and intentional songwriting; a nostalgic yet refreshing charm that leads listeners across a grand frontier of warm and beautiful scenery. However, the band was able to make the jump to full time when his wife Lorien Jeanson (mandolin & harmony) was added to the lineup. Lorien is originally from the redwood forest and farmlands of Northern California, but ended up attending the same college as Jake, where they met and fell in love. The duo swiftly began touring with a rotating cast of friends; playing in theatres, venues, festivals, and living room concerts across the United States. Regardless of their current friend lineup, the group aims to create a magical and organic vibe which translates into the feeling of the music, often singing and playing around a single old fashioned microphone, seamlessly blending the musical composition of their harmonies and instruments. Since 2012, the band has released 4 homegrown records and an EP, with more songs and albums in the works. Growing up and being raised listening to the likes of The Eagles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Jake and Lorien grew an appreciation and aim for group harmonies and heartfelt authenticity , while also striving to be amazing live performers like their modern influences , a few being Fleet Foxes, Mandolin Orange, and The Head and the Heart.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Alex Jordan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11058051.jpeg", "Coordinates": [38.4011362, -122.8226923], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Psychedelic Rock, Alt-country, Rock, California Country, Folk, Honky Tonk, Americana", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Basement Tapes", "moreBioInfo": "Alex is a singer and multi-instrumentalist who has been surrounded by music his whole life.

In the early 1990's, as Green on Red faded to black, Prophet began performing with his future wife Stefanie Finch and releasing independent records on a variety of small labels. Prophet released his solo debut Brother Aldo in 1990 on Fire records,(later reissued in the late 1990's on Walter Yetnikoff's Velvel imprint. His immediate career path took him through mostly European touring markets and his followup \"Balinese Dancer\" came out in 1993 & later the Steve Berlin produced \"Feast of Hearts\" came out in Europe only through the Fire imprint. After a decade long bout with substance abuse, Prophet resurfaced refreshed and renewed on the critical breakthroughs 1998's \"Homemade Blood\", 2000's \"The Hurting Business\" and 2002's live \"Turn The Pigeons Loose\" (all available via Cooking Vinyl in UK). By 2000 he'd recorded a side project with his wife Stefanie called Go Go Market and begun incorporating electronic influences into his traditional roots rock formula, resulting in some mainstream radio play and expanded exposure, culminating in the wider distribution of albums \"No Other Love\" from 2002 and 2004's \"Age of Miracles\" on New West Records. Chuck signed a new arrangement in the US with North Carolina based Yep Roc for 2007's \"Soap and Water\", an album that saw the musician invited to play twice on National Public Radio, as well as on televison talk shows like Late Night With David Letterman, and The Carson Daly Show. Over the years he also began collaborating with other songwriters like Kelly Willis, Steve Yerkey and contributing as a guitarist/musician to studio efforts from folks like Jonathan Richman, Warren Zevon, Kim Carnes, Cake, Tom Heyman and Jewel. Alejandro Escovedo's upcoming 2008 release produced by Tony Visconti entitled Real Animal was co-written and recorded with Prophet. In addition to having his songs recorded by artists like Solomon Burke, Heart & Cyndi Thomson he has also recorded with men who started out as his influences like Jim Dickinson, Dan Penn and the late Warren Zevon. www.chuckprophet.com. www.myspace.com/chuckprophetofficial.", "otherInfo": "The Basement Tapes Live featuring Casual Coalition w/ Stu Al"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "S ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [38.4011362, -122.8226923], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "HopMonk Tavern Sebastopol", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Basement Tapes Live w/s/g CHUCK PROPHET & Casual Coalition"}, {"Address": "224 Vintage Wy, Novato, CA 94945", "Artist": "John Elliott ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11502415.jpeg", "Coordinates": [38.08854600000001, -122.5534481], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hopmonk Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "http://www.thehereafterishere.com", "otherInfo": "Opening for the great Bob Schneider!"}, {"Address": "222 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94102", "Artist": "Tuck & Patti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7308627.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7860081, -122.4092959], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Feinstein's at The Nikko", "moreBioInfo": "Tuck & Patti, that's Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart - a couple that have been making music together for over 25 years and who released ten albums flavoured with jazz, pop, rhythm and blues, gospel, folk, rock and Brazilian genres since 1988 as a duo. Patti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others. Tuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz. In 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day. In 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan. That's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "Feinsteins at the Nikko is thrilled to welcome back legendary jazz duo, Tuck & Patti. For 42 years this unique, genre-crossing vocal/guitar jazz duo has cast its passionate musical spell worldwide, capturing the hearts of lovers, the respect of jazz buffs and the jaw-dropping awe of guitarists and singers. To understand Tuck and Patti, start with the wellspring of love within them, then their music begins to make perfect sense. Married 39 years, Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart continue to stoke the fires, not only of their own love, but also of their love of life and their passion for making music together. They have a long-standing tradition: minimalist arrangements featuring Tucks extraordinary virtuosity and Pattis rich mezzo soprano. Patti, renowned for her remarkable ability to touch hearts directly with her voice, exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he'll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger and producer. Without even blinking, Tuck-the-problem-solver brags, \"Patti writes and arranges; I am just the orchestra.\""}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Ryan Flynn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11242494.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Computer Music, Indie Pop, Synth Pop, Electro Pop, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Originally begun as an experimental side project while in film school, ryan flynn has since evolved into a perpetual orb-praising space pop venture.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium.

A 7\" and a few extra songs for a split 7\" were recorded with Fireside\u00b4s mastermind Pelle Gunnerfelt (Fireside, Hives, Breach) in the spring of 1998. In March 1999 Switchblade recorded their groundbreaking and very well received 10\". This time with a newly recruited 2:nd bassplayer/singer. The 10\" was recorded by Breach\u00b4s mastermind Anders Ekstr\u00f6m. The 10\" turned out very chaotic and fast in tempo. A few months later a few more songs were recorded by Anders Ekstr\u00f6m and those songs ended up as the split 7\"\u00b4s with Cult of Luna and The Jam Session. Then in late 1999 Switchblade took the decision to go on as a three-piece. During 2000 and 2001, switchblade recorded 2 albums together once again with Breach\u00b4s Anders Ekstr\u00f6m turning the knobs. Switchblade toured both Sweden (with Cult of Luna) and Europe (twice) in support of the albums. Then in March 2003, Switchblade recorded their third selftitled full length album. The album was a 6 song, 47 minute sonic journey that ranged from subtle ambient soundscapes to monotonous, dark, instrumental passages to full on stoner flirting, yet epic heaviness. All with just sparse use of vocals. Previously having had some problems in truly capturing their sound and dynamics on tape, Switchblade turned to Carl Wikman at EAR Studios who is known for his big and true to nature sounding recordings. The album turned out to be the most powerful and focused material so far, and showcased a huge leap forward in the never ending evolution of Switchblade\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds sound and songwriting. The album received great reveiws both in Europe and in the US, where the album was released by Jake Banon\u00b4s (CONVERGE) Deathwish/Icarus imprint. A 4 week European tour in support of the album took place in early 2004 and a shorter tour took place in the summer of 2004 based around an apperance at the legendary Ieper Festival in Belgium. In May 2004 Switchblade wanted to try out some new song ideas and approaches so they packed the gear and headed down to the Mission Hall studio located in the countryside in the south of Sweden. The weekend worth of recording together with Mattias Old\u00e9n from LOGH resulted in a 2 track 7\" with guestvocals and guitar, on one of the songs, by Mathias Friberg of LOGH. The 2 songs showed, by far, the most dynamic Switchblade material to that date. Come late summer of 2005, Switchblade packed up their gear and headed down to Mission Hall Studio once again. Having felt so relaxed and enjoyed working with Mathias Old\u00e9n, the choice was easy when picking a studio for the recording of the fourth selftitled Switchblade album. The 43+ minutes album consists of 2 long tracks and sees the band more dynamic than ever before. Insted of a constant wall of sound and riffing, every riff and every tone get alot of space and time to \"breathe\". To add further bleakness, beauty and depth to the album there\u00b4s guestvocals by \"E\" of swedish blackmetal band WATAIN and once again, guestvocals and guitar by Mattias Friberg of LOGH. The tempo of the songs has slowed down for each release and the vocals has taken a more subtle place in the music and more instrumental passages has been brought forward to create a very dark and almost instrumental soundtrack to the apocalypse. Switchblade are currently working on their 5th seftitled album to be recorded in the autumn of 2008.", "otherInfo": "Kandi Love & PLUR Alliance present\nSO STOKED: SUMMER OF LOVE\nMain Room:\n Christopher Lawrence\n Tommie Sunshine\n Rob Gee\n Switchblade\n Brizzy\n Smol Beanz\n Just Trees\n Psychic Monkey\n Selecta & Rayne\nLounge:\n Anglerfish\n Curze\n Elevener\n Gypsy Kid\n Roxas\n\u262e\ufe0f \ud83c\udf38 \u270c\ufe0f \ud83c\udf38 In the summer of 1967, hippies converged on San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury to celebrate LOVE and PEACE and created a counterculture movement of freedom and self-expression.

The band began with humble beginnings as childhood friends forging their love of music into their own band, and over the past 16 years they've grown to become a meticulous killing militia primed to join the bigger league and take things to a more international playing field. Forming under the name \"Atrosity\" in 2001, the band recorded their debut 5-song E.P. in early 2005 after many formative years of learning old school metal classic tunes from the likes of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer and Judas Priest. This 5-song EP, appropriately titled \"Fuck Everything\", was the group's first step in their long journey from leaving the confines of Colfax, CA to the world beyond as Atrosity quickly established themselves as the true, young thrash metal band in the Northern California area. 2005 also cemented the young band's reputation further as they opened for thrash metal legends Kreator and Overkill in Sacramento, CA giving them a taste of professional live performances. In 2006, Atrostiy was forced to undergo a name change due to their being an established death metal band from Germany using the proper English spelling of Atrocity. Quickly deciding on the ultra-heavy alternate name of Devastator, the band continued the metal mayhem as the now revamped headbanging force and needed a release with the new name to get the word out to all the ravenous followers as well as potential new fans they would set out to convert. Devastator recorded a 5-song EP, titled \"Crush and Kill\", which was recorded completely live in the studio in two days. Released on Friday, October 13th, \"Crush and Kill\" quickly lived up and passed its predecessor to further spread the band's name and reputation. Devastator spent most of 2007 playing up and down California with fellow up and coming new thrash bands such as Merciless Death, Hatchet, and Warbringer, as well as with national touring acts such as Kreator (twice), Sodom, Three Inches of Blood, Napalm Death, Overkill (twice), Hirax, and Dragonlord. In the fall of 2007, Devastator once again headed off to the studio, this time in Petaluma, CA, to record their follow-up EP, \"Slaughtered Like Pigs\", with the help of the then current drummer of Hatchet and Slave Productions. With their new recording Devastator joined their Bay Area brothers-in-arms Hatchet on a west coast tour blazing a path of destruction. Pushing ever forward, Devastator spent 2008 touring all over the west coast doing random dates alongside notable names like M.O.D., Heathen and Agent Steel, in addition to signing a publishing agreement with Marco Barbieri's Salem Rose Music. In 2009, Devastator geared up to record their next demo recording, the far more professional \"Burn the Beast\" EP sessions at Trident Studios, which was recorded, mixed and mastered in a week by Juan Urteaga (Testament, Machine Head, Sadus). \"Burn the Beast\" received rave press reviews and metal radio airplay across the country and to build upon the momentum the band embarked on a full US tour that summer, dubbed the \"Slaughtering the Masses\" tour, spreading their music and making new fans in over 40 cities. Upon returning home the band realized they had learned a lot from the experience and pulled back making themselves inactive despite a few one-off stints in 2010 from the aggressive live show routine and began making general improvements to their sound, musicianship, vocals and new material. Aiming to join the big leagues Devastator felt the need for another new name that was more unique and original and dubbed themselves Blessed Curse - because being in a band is both a blessing and a curse. In 2011 with an arsenal of new songs the band headed back to Trident Studios with producer Juan Urteaga to record the full-length album of their self-titled Blessed Curse debut. True metal performed with integrity highlighting the band's distinct take on their metal influences and capturing the past, present and future of Blessed Curse. Packaged with a killer original artwork piece from Marc Sasso (Dio, Halford, Cage), Blessed Curse are ready to take it to the next level and have partnered with Cyclone Empire Records to make that next leap possible. Released in the US under Marco Barbieri's record label M-Theory Audio, the Blessed Curse debut album is available world-wide for the metal masses. Since the completion of their debut, the band returned to the live front assaulting audiences with their intense barrage of metal mayhem and sharing stages all over the west coast with bands like Death Angel, Destruction, D.R.I., Evil Dead, Bonded by Blood, Exmortus, Sacrificial Slaughter, and Witchaven. 2016 has brought a new era to the band. Enlisting 6-string shredder Gregg Laubacher on guitar alongside original members Tyler Satterlee on guitar and vocals as well as Derek Bean on drums, B.C. completed the brand new recording titled \"Beware of the Night\" in 2017. Bringing the band back to Trident Studios with the work of Juan Urteaga the recording session marked the third experience of working at Trident and the result was the most punishing, crushing, and pummeling cut of sonic metal music that Blessed Curse has released to date. Bringing five new tracks to life including the first lyric video for the featured song \"Nightbreed\", Beware of the Night was released in the U.S. under the M-Theory Audio label. Pushing forward with new music and an even more fierce determination to bring B.C. to the wider world, countless shows and more headbanging music await the future of Blessed Curse. Bringing a full on metal assault to the USA since 2001.", "otherInfo": "Performing Live:\n EXMORTUS -- https://www.facebook.com/exmortusofficial\n G\u00dcRSCHACH -- https://www.gurschach.com/\n BLESSED CURSE -- https://www.facebook.com/blessedcurseofficial\nWhen you think of Whittier, California, two things come to mind: cruising and Richard Nixon. Now you can add a third thing to that list: metal band Exmortus. The band touches on the many metal sub genres, from death and black metal to technical, with a penchant for thrash. Hard and heavy with non stop aggression, Exmortus has been slinging the thrash for close to two decades. Founded by cousins (guitarist/songwriter) Conan and Mario (drums), the metal band started as a boyhood extracurricular activity. And even as band members came and went, Exmortus grew and changed, eventually releasing four full lengths filled with brutal tunes. These dudes make the kind of music your catholic parents hate, complete with images of flesh-feasting and decay, not to mention pounding drums and song titles like \"Swallow Your Soul\" (you can tell your parents that this metal band covers Beethoven to even things out). Along with the dark imagery and lyrics comes a technical precision and neoclassical flourishes that you don't always hear in thrash - the instrumentals are sharp and on point, and live the band is tight (being together for almost 20 years will do that to a live set). Exmortus is ready to give what every metal head craves: ferocious vocals, shredding guitars, high energy battle anthems, long hair and leather, and all around mayhem.\nmetal.\ndoors @ 7pm;\nshow @ 7:30pm.\nall ages.\n$15 advance;\n$18 day of show.\nBuy tickets: https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2021/07-23d.html\nWatch and listen:\n Exmortus: Metal Is King: http://youtu.be/JT7q4fpxL0U\n Exmortus: Feast of Flesh: http://youtu.be/1XFj6p6PoYo\n G\u00fcrschach: St. Anger: http://youtu.be/urRruX2PrY0"}, {"Address": "41 Wharf Rd, Bolinas, CA 94924", "Artist": "Caitlin Jemma ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11366664.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.9101935, -122.6851545], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Caitlin Jemma's Single Release + Birthday Party ", "moreBioInfo": "Caitlin Jemma is a small-town girl with a big country heart.

Now you can add a third thing to that list: metal band Exmortus. The band touches on the many metal sub genres, from death and black metal to technical, with a penchant for thrash. Hard and heavy with non stop aggression, Exmortus has been slinging the thrash for close to two decades. Founded by cousins (guitarist/songwriter) Conan and Mario (drums), the metal band started as a boyhood extracurricular activity. And even as band members came and went, Exmortus grew and changed, eventually releasing four full lengths filled with brutal tunes. These dudes make the kind of music your catholic parents hate, complete with images of flesh-feasting and decay, not to mention pounding drums and song titles like \"Swallow Your Soul\" (you can tell your parents that this metal band covers Beethoven to even things out). Along with the dark imagery and lyrics comes a technical precision and neoclassical flourishes that you don't always hear in thrash - the instrumentals are sharp and on point, and live the band is tight (being together for almost 20 years will do that to a live set). Exmortus is ready to give what every metal head craves: ferocious vocals, shredding guitars, high energy battle anthems, long hair and leather, and all around mayhem.\nmetal.\ndoors @ 7pm;\nshow @ 7:30pm.\nall ages.\n$15 advance;\n$18 day of show.\nBuy tickets: https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2021/07-23d.html\nWatch and listen:\n Exmortus: Metal Is King: http://youtu.be/JT7q4fpxL0U\n Exmortus: Feast of Flesh: http://youtu.be/1XFj6p6PoYo\n G\u00fcrschach: St. Anger: http://youtu.be/urRruX2PrY0"}, {"Address": "375 11th St, San Francisco, CA 94103", "Artist": "Christopher Lawrence ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8461025.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.7711031, -122.4126145], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Underground Trance, Trance, Electronic, Tech Trance, Psy Trance", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "DNA Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Christopher Lawrence is an American disc jockey and producer specializing in progressive trance music.

He was involved in a number of highly talented musical ensembles, including the UCI Guitar Ensemble, the IVC Guitar Ensemble, the Cal State Fullerton Orchestra, and the Orange Coast Guitar Society, where he traveled regularly and performed in concert halls across the nation. Meanwhile, Fisk maintained a love and commitment to jazz by attending blues and jazz jams around Orange and Stanislaus Counties of California. Since graduating college, Pete has stayed busy as a professional musician, composing works for screen and film, forming the band HIYA, the 21st Century Woody Guthrie Project, the 21st Century Gershwin Project, all the while teaching guitar and music for the South Orange County Community College District.

Holiday doesn\u2019t pull any punches when he offers his take on the current state of R&B. \u201cRhythm and Blues is lacking storytellers right now,\u201d insists the candid 22-year-old singer/songwriter. Holiday then pauses, name checks the late legendary singer Otis Redding as if to show his soul credentials and asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s our generations\u2019 \u2018Sitting on the Dock of the Bay?\u2019 Lately, it seems hip-hop has been birthing all of the great storytellers. It\u2019s time to show that R&B is way more than just dance music. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to convey with my music. I won\u2019t settle for less.\u201d While such a statement may seem like a bold proclamation from the fresh-faced newcomer, the Washington D.C. native more than backs it up with his debut album, Back of My Lac. The buzz-heavy Music Line Group/Capitol Records release spotlights a burgeoning talent whose diverse influences range from the heartfelt soul of Marvin Gaye to the provocative street poetry of rap icon Tupac Shakur. \u201cMy sound is old school soul with a little mix of hip-hop,\u201d explains Holiday. \u201cIf I had to give it a name I would call it \u2018street soul.\u2019 Nowadays the \u2018hood has little to listen to within R&B. I want my music to be the soundtrack to their lives and beyond.\u201d Indeed, an ambitious J. Holiday is poised to live up to such lofty aspirations. The hypnotic first-single \u201cBe with Me,\u201d produced by Rodney Jerkins, finds Holiday offering the age-old tale of a man wanting to be more than just friends with the object of his affections. \u201cYou be giving me the coldest shoulder/\u2018cause you don\u2019t want your emotions taking over,\u201d he croons. \u201cInstead of talking about you looking for a soldier/are you trying to say you don\u2019t see that in me?\u201d On the title track \u201cBack Of My Lac,\u201d J. Holiday gives listeners a glimpse of his life struggles with heartfelt lines like \u201cI grew up in a house with my mother/I didn\u2019t have my punk ass father/because he felt it was time to move on.\u201d \u201cWithout You\u201d builds on a 70\u2019s groove complete with soulful horns and lush strings as Holiday pushes to win back the love of a woman he\u2019s lost. The bass-heavy hardened blues of \u201cCity Boy\u201d (featuring dirty south rhyme royalty 8 Ball & MJG) is a two-fisted anthem of ghetto empowerment. And on \u201cThug Commandments,\u201d Holiday is backed by a swinging, piano-driven break beat as he drops much-needed jewels for the block: \u201cStop cuffing that young girl, let her breathe/Be a father to your kids\u2026no doo-rags in the Lord\u2019s house/Put trust in the Lord, but keep a glock in the house.\u201d For Holiday, such songwriting comes naturally for a young man who has never forgotten his humble beginnings. \u201cI can say that I\u2019ve lived that street life,\u201d he testifies of his time growing up in Washington D.C. \u201cThe streets are not anything to glamorize. I\u2019m trying to let my people back home know that I\u2019m with them. DC has a lot of talent and I\u2019m just trying to show people that we are here.\u201d J. Holiday is a preachers\u2019 son. Raised in the church by a hardworking mother, the pull of secular music was still too much for him to ignore. Fascinated by the early \u201890s R&B vocal groups such as Boyz II Men, H-Town and Jodeci, J. Holiday soon became enamored with hip-hop, marveling in the intricate rhymes of Jay-Z and OutKast. But it was during a high school talent show when a 14-year-old Holiday knew he had a passion for singing. However, local bands were unable to recruit the budding vocalist, whose mother had plans for her son to finish school before seriously pursuing music. Two years later, J. Holiday would discover the music of Marvin Gaye, an experience he calls a \u201crevelation.\u201d \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t really know that much about him,\u201d he says of the late soul icon. \u201cMarvin became my major influence. He opened me up to folks like Donny Hathaway and Al Green. Those artists had a real honest soul about them. I just wanted to mix that feeling with hip-hop.\u201d The gifted vocalist had found his calling. Holiday skipped college and began recording demos in a local studio. He also found himself increasingly caught up in street activities, but music offered a more positive path. Soon, Holiday met up with current manager Corey Green and formed the group 295, named after the D.C. highway. Buzz for 295 was growing but by 2003 the R&B act disbanded. Fortunately for J. Holiday, his vocal prowess and dynamic stage presence was too much of a commodity to pass up. A&R veteran, Anthony \u201cT.A\u201d Tate, of Music Line Group (Ciara, Teairra Marie) quickly set up a meeting with Capitol Records and a deal was made on the spot. \u201cYou just have to stay true to yourself,\u201d Holiday says of his turbulent journey to becoming a recording artist. \u201cA lot of artists nowadays are trying to be something that they are necessarily not. I don\u2019t care how good a song is\u2026if I don\u2019t feel it personally, I\u2019m not going to sing it because it\u2019s not true to me. I feel very personal about my album. There\u2019s nothing fake about it. This is my life. There are a lot of different stories out here and people just need to listen to them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Yoshi's Oakland Presents J.
