Patti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others. Tuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz. In 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day. In 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan. That's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "Feinsteins at the Nikko is thrilled to welcome back legendary jazz duo Tuck & Patti. For 42 years this unique, genre-crossing vocal/guitar jazz duo has cast its passionate musical spell worldwide, capturing the hearts of lovers, the respect of jazz buffs and the jaw-dropping awe of guitarists and singers. To understand Tuck and Patti, start with the wellspring of love within them, then their music begins to make perfect sense. Married 39 years, Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart continue to stoke the fires, not only of their own love, but also of their love of life and their passion for making music together. They have a long-standing tradition: minimalist arrangements featuring Tuck's extraordinary virtuosity and Pattis rich mezzo soprano. Patti, renowned for her remarkable ability to touch hearts directly with her voice, exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he'll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger and producer.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium.

His warm vocals and authentic writing style combined with a bold grit give Chris James and the Showdowns that classic-infused deep-rooted Americana rock sound. Beginning as a local performer in Portland, Maine, James knew that he had to get his name heard in bigger cities. He left for San Francisco with nothing more than a guitar in hand to find work. Eventually, he joined forces with The Showdowns, a Bay Area-based group comprised of Matt Berg (drums), AJ Leighton (bass), John Paterson (keys), and Whitt Vicena (lead guitar). The unity amongst the band can be felt at every show through their synergized performances. Songs from their debut album, Lucky Breaks, and music from James\u2019 solo work have been played generously on SiriusXM Radio, radio stations throughout California, and placed in TV commercial promos. Chris James and the Showdowns\u2019 second album, Somewhere out in California, is authentic, dance-driven, heartfelt, and has been getting loads of attention from various media outlets. They have a packed tour schedule for the rest of the year, including full band and solo performances. Driving down the open road can get us lost in our thoughts when surrounded by the right views and accompanied by the right music. The title track off the album, \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d begins with an acoustic guitar solo then joined by elegant piano keys. The intimate video is characterized by the natural beauty of California: the views, the ocean, and the forests. \u201cSomewhere out in California\u201d is the narration of a restless heart, reminiscing on all the possible \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of life. Every day we are forced to make hundreds of choices, big and small. After making a decision we sometimes have afterthoughts, imagining how life would be if different decisions were made and if different things were said. The lyric, \u201cDid you ever feel like we missed the bus\u201d is the metaphorical concern of making the wrong choices in the past and missing prime opportunities or possible new adventures.

The highly engaging four-piece dynamically performs around one microphone, where each instrument and voice crafts a specific part of each story; creating intimate, savory folk music that warms the heart and feeds the soul.\u201d -Nicholas Edward Williams, Earthtone Booking- The Riverside originated in Southern California where founding member, Jacob Jeanson (songwriter & guitar), was attending Westmont College in 2012. In his senior year, the band formed in hopes of winning Santa Barbara\u2019s battle of the bands. As an energetic and engaging folk band with foot stomping musical companions, the group was able to win the competition and release their first album with the winnings. In the following years, Jake got to play with many talented friends and personalities which helped mold the band\u2019s vision and created time to grow in tasteful and intentional songwriting; a nostalgic yet refreshing charm that leads listeners across a grand frontier of warm and beautiful scenery. However, the band was able to make the jump to full time when his wife Lorien Jeanson (mandolin & harmony) was added to the lineup. Lorien is originally from the redwood forest and farmlands of Northern California, but ended up attending the same college as Jake, where they met and fell in love. The duo swiftly began touring with a rotating cast of friends; playing in theatres, venues, festivals, and living room concerts across the United States. Regardless of their current friend lineup, the group aims to create a magical and organic vibe which translates into the feeling of the music, often singing and playing around a single old fashioned microphone, seamlessly blending the musical composition of their harmonies and instruments. Since 2012, the band has released 4 homegrown records and an EP, with more songs and albums in the works. Growing up and being raised listening to the likes of The Eagles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Jake and Lorien grew an appreciation and aim for group harmonies and heartfelt authenticity , while also striving to be amazing live performers like their modern influences , a few being Fleet Foxes, Mandolin Orange, and The Head and the Heart.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "230 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472", "Artist": "Alex Jordan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11058051.jpeg", "Coordinates": [38.4011362, -122.8226923], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Honky Tonk, Americana, Psychedelic Rock, Alt-country, California Country, Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Basement Tapes", "moreBioInfo": "Alex is a singer and multi-instrumentalist who has been surrounded by music his whole life.

Patti hails from San Francisco and knew from the age of six that she wanted to be a singer. She started to sing in church, directed choirs by the age of 10 and received voice lessons in high school. As she was raised in the Bay Area in the 60s she was influenced by all the styles of music going on and places like The Fillmore were second home to her - even Bill Graham watched out for her. Patti jammed with hundreds of musicians during that time and learned how to improvise in any style. Some might remember that Patti was one of the founding members of Kingfish - featuring Bobby Weir, Matthew Kelly, Dave Torbert, Barry Flast among others. Tuck was influenced by swing and classical music from an early age but it wasn't until the Beatles and Rolling Stones came out that he knew he had to play rock and roll. Because Tuck's sister had taught him how to play the piano he started with that instrument but soon decided that the guitar would be a better choice. Although Tuck was influenced by rock music he started to learn complex jazz chords instead, simply because he had the Mel Chord Book, with 400 Orchestral Chords in the appendix, at hand. When he heard Jimi Hendrix for the first time he was not only blown away, he considered it impossible for him to come up with such a sound himself and he dived even deeper into jazz. In 1970 Tuck enrolled in Stanford where he would later major in music and played in several rock and jazz bands at the same time. He even went to Los Angeles to play in bands and took the guitar position for the Sonny and Cher TV show for some time - but decided to leave the L.A. scene before it could swallow him. Instead he headed to the Bay Area where he would play in top 40, soul and rock bands or practice and listen to music 8 to sometimes 14 hours a day. In 1978 Tuck was playing in a band Patti came to audition for. Once they met they immediately knew they had found their musical soul mate (and partner in life). Since the band didn't happen Tuck and Patti decided to work as a duo and their instant success in the Bay Area proved that their formula that every song had to speak and be played from their hearts worked. Ten years later they would release their first CD Tears of Joy and the rest is history as they say. Tuck & Patti have become a well known act worldwide - especially in Europe and Japan. That's also the reason why their CD A Gift of Love got released. They actually produced this album for their fans in Japan who wanted to hear Tuck & Patti's interpretations of classical love songs. The album turned out to be yet another success, once it was released in Japan it had to be released in Europe as well. Last but not least, 33rd Street Records released the album in July 2004 for the American market. What does this tell us? Simply that good music will always find its way.", "otherInfo": "Feinsteins at the Nikko is thrilled to welcome back legendary jazz duo, Tuck & Patti. For 42 years this unique, genre-crossing vocal/guitar jazz duo has cast its passionate musical spell worldwide, capturing the hearts of lovers, the respect of jazz buffs and the jaw-dropping awe of guitarists and singers. To understand Tuck and Patti, start with the wellspring of love within them, then their music begins to make perfect sense. Married 39 years, Tuck Andress and Patti Cathcart continue to stoke the fires, not only of their own love, but also of their love of life and their passion for making music together. They have a long-standing tradition: minimalist arrangements featuring Tucks extraordinary virtuosity and Pattis rich mezzo soprano. Patti, renowned for her remarkable ability to touch hearts directly with her voice, exudes the soft, centered yet powerful graciousness of a gospel singer; Tuck almost wears his brain on his skin, anticipating the thousands of musical decisions he'll have to send to his ten fingers during the course of a performance. Seeing the virtuosity and complexity of Tuck's guitar work, most are surprised to learn that Patti is the actual writer, arranger and producer.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views.

A 7\" and a few extra songs for a split 7\" were recorded with Fireside\u00b4s mastermind Pelle Gunnerfelt (Fireside, Hives, Breach) in the spring of 1998. In March 1999 Switchblade recorded their groundbreaking and very well received 10\". This time with a newly recruited 2:nd bassplayer/singer. The 10\" was recorded by Breach\u00b4s mastermind Anders Ekstr\u00f6m. The 10\" turned out very chaotic and fast in tempo. A few months later a few more songs were recorded by Anders Ekstr\u00f6m and those songs ended up as the split 7\"\u00b4s with Cult of Luna and The Jam Session. Then in late 1999 Switchblade took the decision to go on as a three-piece. During 2000 and 2001, switchblade recorded 2 albums together once again with Breach\u00b4s Anders Ekstr\u00f6m turning the knobs. Switchblade toured both Sweden (with Cult of Luna) and Europe (twice) in support of the albums. Then in March 2003, Switchblade recorded their third selftitled full length album. The album was a 6 song, 47 minute sonic journey that ranged from subtle ambient soundscapes to monotonous, dark, instrumental passages to full on stoner flirting, yet epic heaviness. All with just sparse use of vocals. Previously having had some problems in truly capturing their sound and dynamics on tape, Switchblade turned to Carl Wikman at EAR Studios who is known for his big and true to nature sounding recordings. The album turned out to be the most powerful and focused material so far, and showcased a huge leap forward in the never ending evolution of Switchblade\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds sound and songwriting. The album received great reveiws both in Europe and in the US, where the album was released by Jake Banon\u00b4s (CONVERGE) Deathwish/Icarus imprint. A 4 week European tour in support of the album took place in early 2004 and a shorter tour took place in the summer of 2004 based around an apperance at the legendary Ieper Festival in Belgium. In May 2004 Switchblade wanted to try out some new song ideas and approaches so they packed the gear and headed down to the Mission Hall studio located in the countryside in the south of Sweden. The weekend worth of recording together with Mattias Old\u00e9n from LOGH resulted in a 2 track 7\" with guestvocals and guitar, on one of the songs, by Mathias Friberg of LOGH. The 2 songs showed, by far, the most dynamic Switchblade material to that date. Come late summer of 2005, Switchblade packed up their gear and headed down to Mission Hall Studio once again. Having felt so relaxed and enjoyed working with Mathias Old\u00e9n, the choice was easy when picking a studio for the recording of the fourth selftitled Switchblade album. The 43+ minutes album consists of 2 long tracks and sees the band more dynamic than ever before. Insted of a constant wall of sound and riffing, every riff and every tone get alot of space and time to \"breathe\". To add further bleakness, beauty and depth to the album there\u00b4s guestvocals by \"E\" of swedish blackmetal band WATAIN and once again, guestvocals and guitar by Mattias Friberg of LOGH. The tempo of the songs has slowed down for each release and the vocals has taken a more subtle place in the music and more instrumental passages has been brought forward to create a very dark and almost instrumental soundtrack to the apocalypse.

The band began with humble beginnings as childhood friends forging their love of music into their own band, and over the past 16 years they've grown to become a meticulous killing militia primed to join the bigger league and take things to a more international playing field. Forming under the name \"Atrosity\" in 2001, the band recorded their debut 5-song E.P. in early 2005 after many formative years of learning old school metal classic tunes from the likes of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer and Judas Priest. This 5-song EP, appropriately titled \"Fuck Everything\", was the group's first step in their long journey from leaving the confines of Colfax, CA to the world beyond as Atrosity quickly established themselves as the true, young thrash metal band in the Northern California area. 2005 also cemented the young band's reputation further as they opened for thrash metal legends Kreator and Overkill in Sacramento, CA giving them a taste of professional live performances. In 2006, Atrostiy was forced to undergo a name change due to their being an established death metal band from Germany using the proper English spelling of Atrocity. Quickly deciding on the ultra-heavy alternate name of Devastator, the band continued the metal mayhem as the now revamped headbanging force and needed a release with the new name to get the word out to all the ravenous followers as well as potential new fans they would set out to convert. Devastator recorded a 5-song EP, titled \"Crush and Kill\", which was recorded completely live in the studio in two days. Released on Friday, October 13th, \"Crush and Kill\" quickly lived up and passed its predecessor to further spread the band's name and reputation. Devastator spent most of 2007 playing up and down California with fellow up and coming new thrash bands such as Merciless Death, Hatchet, and Warbringer, as well as with national touring acts such as Kreator (twice), Sodom, Three Inches of Blood, Napalm Death, Overkill (twice), Hirax, and Dragonlord. In the fall of 2007, Devastator once again headed off to the studio, this time in Petaluma, CA, to record their follow-up EP, \"Slaughtered Like Pigs\", with the help of the then current drummer of Hatchet and Slave Productions. With their new recording Devastator joined their Bay Area brothers-in-arms Hatchet on a west coast tour blazing a path of destruction. Pushing ever forward, Devastator spent 2008 touring all over the west coast doing random dates alongside notable names like M.O.D., Heathen and Agent Steel, in addition to signing a publishing agreement with Marco Barbieri's Salem Rose Music. In 2009, Devastator geared up to record their next demo recording, the far more professional \"Burn the Beast\" EP sessions at Trident Studios, which was recorded, mixed and mastered in a week by Juan Urteaga (Testament, Machine Head, Sadus). \"Burn the Beast\" received rave press reviews and metal radio airplay across the country and to build upon the momentum the band embarked on a full US tour that summer, dubbed the \"Slaughtering the Masses\" tour, spreading their music and making new fans in over 40 cities. Upon returning home the band realized they had learned a lot from the experience and pulled back making themselves inactive despite a few one-off stints in 2010 from the aggressive live show routine and began making general improvements to their sound, musicianship, vocals and new material. Aiming to join the big leagues Devastator felt the need for another new name that was more unique and original and dubbed themselves Blessed Curse - because being in a band is both a blessing and a curse. In 2011 with an arsenal of new songs the band headed back to Trident Studios with producer Juan Urteaga to record the full-length album of their self-titled Blessed Curse debut. True metal performed with integrity highlighting the band's distinct take on their metal influences and capturing the past, present and future of Blessed Curse. Packaged with a killer original artwork piece from Marc Sasso (Dio, Halford, Cage), Blessed Curse are ready to take it to the next level and have partnered with Cyclone Empire Records to make that next leap possible. Released in the US under Marco Barbieri's record label M-Theory Audio, the Blessed Curse debut album is available world-wide for the metal masses. Since the completion of their debut, the band returned to the live front assaulting audiences with their intense barrage of metal mayhem and sharing stages all over the west coast with bands like Death Angel, Destruction, D.R.I., Evil Dead, Bonded by Blood, Exmortus, Sacrificial Slaughter, and Witchaven. 2016 has brought a new era to the band. Enlisting 6-string shredder Gregg Laubacher on guitar alongside original members Tyler Satterlee on guitar and vocals as well as Derek Bean on drums, B.C. completed the brand new recording titled \"Beware of the Night\" in 2017. Bringing the band back to Trident Studios with the work of Juan Urteaga the recording session marked the third experience of working at Trident and the result was the most punishing, crushing, and pummeling cut of sonic metal music that Blessed Curse has released to date. Bringing five new tracks to life including the first lyric video for the featured song \"Nightbreed\", Beware of the Night was released in the U.S. under the M-Theory Audio label. Pushing forward with new music and an even more fierce determination to bring B.C. to the wider world, countless shows and more headbanging music await the future of Blessed Curse.

Holiday doesn\u2019t pull any punches when he offers his take on the current state of R&B. \u201cRhythm and Blues is lacking storytellers right now,\u201d insists the candid 22-year-old singer/songwriter. Holiday then pauses, name checks the late legendary singer Otis Redding as if to show his soul credentials and asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s our generations\u2019 \u2018Sitting on the Dock of the Bay?\u2019 Lately, it seems hip-hop has been birthing all of the great storytellers. It\u2019s time to show that R&B is way more than just dance music. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to convey with my music. I won\u2019t settle for less.\u201d While such a statement may seem like a bold proclamation from the fresh-faced newcomer, the Washington D.C. native more than backs it up with his debut album, Back of My Lac. The buzz-heavy Music Line Group/Capitol Records release spotlights a burgeoning talent whose diverse influences range from the heartfelt soul of Marvin Gaye to the provocative street poetry of rap icon Tupac Shakur. \u201cMy sound is old school soul with a little mix of hip-hop,\u201d explains Holiday. \u201cIf I had to give it a name I would call it \u2018street soul.\u2019 Nowadays the \u2018hood has little to listen to within R&B. I want my music to be the soundtrack to their lives and beyond.\u201d Indeed, an ambitious J. Holiday is poised to live up to such lofty aspirations. The hypnotic first-single \u201cBe with Me,\u201d produced by Rodney Jerkins, finds Holiday offering the age-old tale of a man wanting to be more than just friends with the object of his affections. \u201cYou be giving me the coldest shoulder/\u2018cause you don\u2019t want your emotions taking over,\u201d he croons. \u201cInstead of talking about you looking for a soldier/are you trying to say you don\u2019t see that in me?\u201d On the title track \u201cBack Of My Lac,\u201d J. Holiday gives listeners a glimpse of his life struggles with heartfelt lines like \u201cI grew up in a house with my mother/I didn\u2019t have my punk ass father/because he felt it was time to move on.\u201d \u201cWithout You\u201d builds on a 70\u2019s groove complete with soulful horns and lush strings as Holiday pushes to win back the love of a woman he\u2019s lost. The bass-heavy hardened blues of \u201cCity Boy\u201d (featuring dirty south rhyme royalty 8 Ball & MJG) is a two-fisted anthem of ghetto empowerment. And on \u201cThug Commandments,\u201d Holiday is backed by a swinging, piano-driven break beat as he drops much-needed jewels for the block: \u201cStop cuffing that young girl, let her breathe/Be a father to your kids\u2026no doo-rags in the Lord\u2019s house/Put trust in the Lord, but keep a glock in the house.\u201d For Holiday, such songwriting comes naturally for a young man who has never forgotten his humble beginnings. \u201cI can say that I\u2019ve lived that street life,\u201d he testifies of his time growing up in Washington D.C. \u201cThe streets are not anything to glamorize. I\u2019m trying to let my people back home know that I\u2019m with them. DC has a lot of talent and I\u2019m just trying to show people that we are here.\u201d J. Holiday is a preachers\u2019 son. Raised in the church by a hardworking mother, the pull of secular music was still too much for him to ignore. Fascinated by the early \u201890s R&B vocal groups such as Boyz II Men, H-Town and Jodeci, J. Holiday soon became enamored with hip-hop, marveling in the intricate rhymes of Jay-Z and OutKast. But it was during a high school talent show when a 14-year-old Holiday knew he had a passion for singing. However, local bands were unable to recruit the budding vocalist, whose mother had plans for her son to finish school before seriously pursuing music. Two years later, J. Holiday would discover the music of Marvin Gaye, an experience he calls a \u201crevelation.\u201d \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t really know that much about him,\u201d he says of the late soul icon. \u201cMarvin became my major influence. He opened me up to folks like Donny Hathaway and Al Green. Those artists had a real honest soul about them. I just wanted to mix that feeling with hip-hop.\u201d The gifted vocalist had found his calling. Holiday skipped college and began recording demos in a local studio. He also found himself increasingly caught up in street activities, but music offered a more positive path. Soon, Holiday met up with current manager Corey Green and formed the group 295, named after the D.C. highway. Buzz for 295 was growing but by 2003 the R&B act disbanded. Fortunately for J. Holiday, his vocal prowess and dynamic stage presence was too much of a commodity to pass up. A&R veteran, Anthony \u201cT.A\u201d Tate, of Music Line Group (Ciara, Teairra Marie) quickly set up a meeting with Capitol Records and a deal was made on the spot. \u201cYou just have to stay true to yourself,\u201d Holiday says of his turbulent journey to becoming a recording artist. \u201cA lot of artists nowadays are trying to be something that they are necessarily not. I don\u2019t care how good a song is\u2026if I don\u2019t feel it personally, I\u2019m not going to sing it because it\u2019s not true to me. I feel very personal about my album.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium.

On their new album, \"With All Its Thorns,\" they delve deeper into country music's tradition of storytelling with songs about betrayal (\"Secrets\"), murder (\"In Red\"), and grief (\"Ghostship\"), with a whole lot of heartbreak in between. Their twangy honesty shines through in straightforward arrangements, crystalline harmonies, and spare instrumentation. Beware their catchy hooks and sweet melodies - these stray puppy tunes will follow you home and become your most steadfast companions. Laura Benitez, songwriter, lead singer and founder of Laura Benitez and the Heartache, has been making her mark on stage and screen since 2000. She spent several years appearing in soap operas and commercials in Los Angeles before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2004, diving into the region\u2019s rich Americana and Roots music scenes. Taking her musical cues from the heavily rock influenced Bakersfield sound, and her lyric inspiration from her favorite songwriters Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, Laura began writing songs in 2008. She released her first album, \"For Duty or for Love\" on her own Copperhead Records label in 2010. In 2012 she recruited the multi-talented singer, songwriter, and drummer Michele Kappel-Stone (Kirby Grips/Tippy Canoe/Heartache Sisters) into the band, and was lucky enough to secure the talents of Bob Spector (The Spectones) and Ted O'Connell (The GoldDiggers, Moonshine Maybelline) on twang guitar and bass. These four joined together with Ian Taylor Sutton (The Walcotts, Misisipi Mike, Secret Town) on pedal steel to record their critically acclaimed full length album, \"Heartless Woman,\" which was released in 2014. 2015 saw the band touring to festivals in Southern California and Nashville, but also saw some changes in personnel, with Michele Kappel-Stone and Ted O'Connell turning their full-time attention to other projects. New members of The Heartache include Steve Pearson (Secret Town), Mike Anderson (77 El Deora), Jim Goodkind (Whiskey Pass), Patti Maxine (Island Breeze, Henhouse), and Chris Weinress (Mojo Mix).

In 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of super-group Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene is also a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh\u2019s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows. Musical passion and creative integrity have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. Growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar during his childhood. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement. Still in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike. After graduating from high school, Jackie relocated to Sacramento, where he quickly became a local favorite. His popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal. Greene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. After a five year recording hiatus to focus on touring with Phil Lesh, the Black Crowes, Trigger Hippy, and WRG, Greene\u2019s latest album, Back to Birth, will be released in August 2015. \"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\" Although he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work. \"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1435 Webster St., Alameda, CA 94501", "Artist": "Lucy & The Long Haul ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8953634.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.77253839999999, -122.2770787], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room & Fireside Lounge presents", "moreBioInfo": "Rock and roll from Oakland CA", "otherInfo": "Tiny Towns Outdoor Concert Series"}, {"Address": "1435 Webster St., Alameda, CA 94501", "Artist": "Tarnation ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.77253839999999, -122.2770787], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative Country, Country", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room & Fireside Lounge presents", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tiny Towns Outdoor Concert Series"}, {"Address": "1435 Webster St., Alameda, CA 94501", "Artist": "Paula Frazer ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [37.77253839999999, -122.2770787], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Songwriter, Country, Folk, Alternative Country, Singer", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Ivy Room & Fireside Lounge presents", "moreBioInfo": "lead vocalist for tarnation and now soloist. she has a brilliant, exact country voice capable of yodelling to great effect. the arrangements of her songs are eerie and lovely, inflected with morricone atmospheres. second to singing, she weaves all manner of beautiful things from materials.", "otherInfo": "Tiny Towns Outdoor Concert Series"}, {"Address": "2700 Mitchell Dr, Walnut Creek, CA 94598", "Artist": "Michelle Lambert ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11484263.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.9312178, -122.0256745], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop, Acoustic Folk Pop, Female Vocals", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Michelle at Calicraft Brewing Co.", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cMichelle Lambert is the kind of electric performer whose deep talent reveals itself in sly, knowing bursts.

This vocal powerhouse aims to connect communities with her universal language of love, hope, and happiness. Her unique musical and lyrical blend -- Bay Area urban soul tinged with the influence of her indigenous Filipino roots --has captured the ears of music lovers around the world. Boasting a vocal range that might be bigger than her, Cruz emanates a classic and timeless feel. Two full-length albums (Feel\u2019osophy and Universoul Symphony) and an EP (Illuminate Love) have garnered numerous awards and nominations including two Bay Area Black Music Awards for \"Best CD/Recorded Performance\" and \"Bay Area Rising Star\" as well as Northern California Entertainers Music Award nominations for \"Female Neo Soul Artist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year.\u201d She has supported several established acts including: Kenny Lattimore, Miki Howard, Keke Wyatt, Bilal, and others. The songstress approaches her music unapologetically and freely, staying true to herself, while her stellar band \"Instrumentali-T\" provides a grown and sexy soundtrack for her vocal creations. They completed a 17-venue, 4 month \u201cSOULShine Tour\u201d around California in the summer of 2016. Most recently, she had a SOLD OUT dual CD release concert with R&B/Soul band Feelosophy at Yoshi's in Oakland on 8/22/17. Cruz continues to grow personally and musically, introducing a new chapter into her musical journey. Her newest single, \"Losing in Love\u201d is perhaps her most vulnerable composition to date. It is a prelude to the collection of raw emotions captured on her upcoming EP \u201cH3artifacts.\u201d Paired down to only a piano and vocals, the record conveys the ultimate form of musical vulnerability and fragility. Digging deep into a broken heart, the record explores themes of love, loss, pain, and hope. \u201cI wrote \u2018Losing in Love\u2019 during a very painful time in my life. I felt like my heart was breaking into a million pieces and I was losing everything all at once. I couldn't stop crying so I poured out all of my emotions and wrote a song. It was a cathartic release,\u201d shares Cruz. She is fearlessly exposed as she shares her personal journey of reclaiming self-love, perseverance, humility, resilience, and healing. With her continued success and loyal fan base, this new release will not disappoint. She continues to tour and record as well as remaining a strong presence in her community, working with local youth as a vocal coach and mentor.

Made from years of traveling the world and honing his craft and moving effortlessly through several musical genres without a single tune sounding the same. Seriously good songwriting that\u2019s augmented by what many are calling the best seven piece band in New York. All led by Chapell - Mephistopheles outfitted in a well-tailored white linen suit. Growing up on the \u201cmean streets\u201d of Stamford, Connecticut, Alan Chapell was something of a musical wunderkind - playing piano and trumpet before the age of six. He recorded with the legendary Jimmy Ienner at age 15, and more recently with Talking Head Jerry Harrison. He\u2019s played to jam-packed houses around the world from Mumbai to Managua. It took Chapell a while to get here, but audiences across the U.S. are starting to take notice in a big way. Chapell\u2019s band includes Lorenza Ponce on violin, Ann Klein on guitar, Ali Culotta on piano, Malcom Gold on bass and Rodney Howard on drums. Ponce plays a variety of delicious retro-synth lines which both play off of and play with Klein\u2019s guitar work. There are multiple moving parts that all go together a bit differently depending on the song (and Chapell\u2019s mood.) Chapell\u2019s live show is a cacophony of juxtapositions. His set moves seamless from genre to genre and from topic to topic. From songs about love to songs about more heady topics such as gun violence and human rights. And finally, to a parody of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent Congressional testimony. With all that, Chapell somehow manages to keep things fun \u2013 not to mention you are guaranteed to leave the night with at least a few of Chapell\u2019s melodies stuck in your head. On making music in 2019 Chapell now says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m discovering myself as an artist in a way I never could have earlier in my life. For too long, I bought into the notion that I couldn\u2019t become a successful artist in my 30\u2019s \u2013 and it was liberating to recognize how foolish that was. The most invigorating thing is that I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve written my best song yet.

Take Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra\u2014 passing through tradition, the quartet stumbled upon innovation, proving that old souls can be creatively fresh. The Santa Cruz, California-based quartet\u2019s latest, Stereoscope, out February 9, 2018, marks an evolutionary leap in a journey of artistic identity, songwriting maturity, band friendship and fiery group synergy. Here, Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra homed in on their signature cosmic roots aesthetic, brimming with cinematic songcraft, impressionistic lyrics, clever arrangements, telepathic ensemble interplay, and soulfully world-weary vocals. Imagine the delta blues reprised by psychedelic indie rockers. \u201cMy whole career has been based on better understanding what\u2019s real and important in artistry, and what is bull#$%,\u201d says Marty. \u201cWhen you weed out all the excess, the little thing that is left is you.\u201d Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra features Marty on electrified resonator guitar and vocals, Chris Lynch on violin and keys, Ben Berry on upright bass, and Matt Goff on drums and percussion. The group specializes in roots music with evocative lyrics that are conceptually cryptic, relying on imagery and symbols to convey emotion. Artistic touchstones for the group include John Lee Hooker, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, the darkly cathartic oeuvre of Tom Waits, and the experimental arrangements of Radiohead. In its five-year existence, the band has released one previous full length, one EP, and toured nationally and internationally, selling out venues along the West Coast and throughout the United Kingdom. Select career live performance highlights include performing at Outsidelands Festival, Bottlerock, and the Maverick Festival, where despite being at the bottom of the bill, the group managed to sell more CDs than any other artist in the festival's history. They\u2019ve opened for such diverse artists as Shakey Graves, Deer Tick, Martin Sexton, and Kaki King. In addition, they\u2019ve been featured on NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition, and the band\u2019s beloved track, \"Cold Canary Gaslight,\" from its 2014 studio debut album, Pray for Rain, has currently surpassed passed one million Spotify listens. Marty\u2019s blues epiphany came from a somewhat hilarious turn of events when, as a teenager, he tried to download a hip hop track on Napster, but accidently downloaded Blind Willie Johnson\u2019s \u201cLet Your Light Shine On Me.\u201d It was indeed a fateful mistake. Marty saw an avenue of expression for his teen angst in the simple 3-chord structures and earthy melodies of the blues, and dove headfirst into the tradition. \u201cI was dealing with a lot of stuff emotionally at the time, and I would sit in my bedroom, play guitar, and listen to old blues for hours. My parents would leave food for me outside my door,\u201d Marty recalls, laughing. \u201cThere was something both angry and calming about that music that resonated with me. That music was my place to get away from all my troubles.\u201d Later, Marty\u2019s father, a voracious music lover, hipped him to John Fahey\u2019s The Yellow Princess (Vanguard Records, 1968), and that record illuminated the possibilities one could explore with roots music. \u201cI felt like that record had one foot in blues and American folk music, and one foot somewhere else,\u201d Marty explains. That John Fahey record\u2019s lesson would play a part in the evolution of the Old Soul Orchestra from reverent traditionalists to Americana adventurers, as evidenced by Stereoscope. The album represents the maturation of artists shedding hero worship and embracing the creativity within. These new frontiers are characterized by a heartfelt purity in Marty\u2019s vocals, the tracks\u2019 unique and richly expressive chord structures and progressions, a shift in narrative perspectives to a more observational bend, and emotionally dynamic arrangements that are beautifully arresting, often beginning with sparse simplicity and then reaching lush and fully orchestrated climaxes with sensitive group interplay. The 11-song album opens with \u201cFirmament,\u201d which eases in with delicately eerie ambience and sparse musical accompaniment, revealing all the soulful nuances and inflections in Marty\u2019s voice. The song soars forward with an impactful arrangement as the full band joins in with rich and varied musicality, including a dazzling drum and percussive break and a violin solo as brilliantly fractured as a cubist painting. The album\u2019s third track, the haunting \u201cGhost,\u201d is a swampy ambient blues that uses the phenomena of sleep paralysis as an intriguing metaphor for vulnerability. The standout album single \u201cOff and On Again\u201d offers sweet yearning for a d\u00e9tente after a lover\u2019s quarrel. Other album highlights include a rendition of Skip James\u2019 blues classic \u201cHard Time Killing Floor\u201d with chillingly beautiful new music to accompany the haunting traditional lyrics, and the three stirring, but challenging, instrumentally-driven songs that conclude the album and recall fringe jazz guitarist\u2019s Bill Frisell\u2019s evocations of dustbowl Americana with futuristic ambience. Stereoscope is no doubt a milestone entry for Marty O\u2019Reilly & the Old Soul Orchestra, offering forth the band\u2019s most assured and mature release to date. \u201cWe put our heart and soul into this album,\u201d shares Marty. \u201cIt\u2019s the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make\u2014one that ten years later I can still be proud of. Making it has made me feel whole, and brought me a lot of joy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4100 Monterey Hwy, San Jose, CA 95122", "Artist": "Montez De Durango ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8455004.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.2794835, -121.8341096], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Duranguense, International", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Event Center La Ceiba", "moreBioInfo": "Se forma en la ciudad de Chicago all\u00e1 por 1996, encabezado por su fundador y director musical, Jos\u00e9 Luis Terrazas, quien re\u00fane a un grupo de talentosos m\u00fasicos que al igual que \u00e9l, ten\u00edan un gran deseo de triunfar y dejar huella en la m\u00fasica regional mexicana. Diez a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, las ventas millonarias de discos tales como: \u201cRAMA SECA\u201d, \u201cTU MIRADA\u201d, \u201cDE DURANGO A CHICAGO\u201d, \u201cEN VIVO DESDE CHICAGO\u201d, \u201cY SIGUE LA MATA DANDO\u201d entre otros, respaldan el impresionante \u00e9xito de MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO que ha impuesto un estilo en la m\u00fasica, la manera de bailar y vestir. El tema \u201cRama Seca\u201d es el que les abre las puertas de la disquera BMG, la cual los firma y les produce su primer disco del mismo nombre. \u201cTU MIRADA\u201d es el t\u00edtulo de su segunda producci\u00f3n que tambi\u00e9n es grabada bajo el sello de BMG. Su tercer disco titulado \u201cLA AUSENCIA\u201d fue el primero que grabaron para su propio sello Terrazas Records, marcando con \u00e9ste, lo que ser\u00eda el inicio de sus m\u00faltiples \u00e9xitos. Posteriormente, para cuando grabaron el disco \u201cLOS PRIMOS DE BALTAZAR\u201d; el grupo ya empezaba a figurar como un fen\u00f3meno musical, rompiendo r\u00e9cords de taquilla en sus presentaciones. \u201cCON SABOR A TAMBORAZO\u201d, fue su quinta producci\u00f3n con la que inmediatamente acapararon la atenci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico, anim\u00e1ndose a grabar su sexto disco totalmente en vivo. Despu\u00e9s de 6 producciones, Jos\u00e9 Luis Terrazas acepta la invitaci\u00f3n que la disquera transnacional Disa Latin Music le hace para formar parte de su elenco, grabando de inmediato el primer disco para este sello titulado \u201cEL SUBE Y BAJA\u201d. Demostrando que el pasito duranguense no era exclusivo de la ciudad de los vientos, se lanz\u00f3 en octubre del 2003, el disco \u201cDE DURANGO A CHICAGO\u201d, s\u00f3lo superado en las listas de Billboard por el \u00e1lbum \u201c33\u201d de Luis Miguel. Para el a\u00f1o 2004, en agradecimiento a la ciudad que los vio formarse musicalmente, grabaron el disco titulado \u201cEN VIVO DESDE CHICAGO\u201d, el cual debut\u00f3 en la posici\u00f3n n\u00famero uno de Billboard. Tanto es el auge de la onda duranguense, que Disa decidi\u00f3 realizar un producto especial con varios artistas del g\u00e9nero, sin embargo; la peculiaridad de esta producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cQUE CHIDO! EL PASITO DURANGUENSE\u201d es la magistral participaci\u00f3n que tiene MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO. Previo a lanzar en el 2005 su producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO particip\u00f3 de manera especial en un disco titulado \u201cLAS MAS BAILABLES DEL PASITO DURANGUENSE. En febrero del 2005, sale al mercado el \u00e1lbum \u201cY SIGUE LA MATA DANDO\u201d, una producci\u00f3n muy esperada por el p\u00fablico, que gracias a su apoyo les trajo muchas satisfacciones. M\u00e1s vivos que nunca y disfrutando de un \u00e9xito sin precedente en cada presentaci\u00f3n, MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO decide lanzar tambi\u00e9n en el 2005, otras dos producciones discogr\u00e1ficas de \u00e9xitos, la primera titulada \u201cVIVE\u201d y la segunda que sali\u00f3 para cerrar el a\u00f1o con el nombre de \u201cLOS S\u00daPER \u00c9XITOS LAGRIMILLAS TONTAS\u201d, en el que incluyen como bonus track el \u00e9xito \u201cLagrimillas tontas\u201d. En el 2006, la agrupaci\u00f3n sigui\u00f3 cosechando triunfos y es as\u00ed que su casa disquera saca a la venta varias producciones, la primera de ellas denominada \u201c500 NOVILLOS\u201d, un disco que caus\u00f3 furor a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, pero lo presentan de una manera totalmente fresca y renovada, aprovechando los nuevos avances tecnol\u00f3gicos de la actualidad. Este \u00e1lbum le da paso a los \u201c\u00c9XITOS EN VIVO\u201d, producci\u00f3n que recopila los grandes \u00e9xitos que la agrupaci\u00f3n ha tenido a lo largo de su carrera, sigui\u00e9ndole tambi\u00e9n \u201cGRUPO MONT\u00c9Z E INVITADOS\u201d y \u201cLOS S\u00daPER \u00c9XITOS 2 ADI\u00d3S A MI AMANTE\u201d. Para cerrar con broche de oro el 2006, MONT\u00c9Z DE DURANGO present\u00f3 su disco \u201cBORR\u00d3N Y CUENTA NUEVA\u201d, producci\u00f3n que mostr\u00f3 una gran evoluci\u00f3n en la mezcla de ritmos. Los temas \u201cAdi\u00f3s a mi amante\u201d, \u201cQue vuelva\u201d y \u201cMe duele escuchar tu nombre\u201d, se lograron posicionar como consentidos del p\u00fablico. La sorpresa musical fue sin lugar a dudas, la incursi\u00f3n de la agrupaci\u00f3n al g\u00e9nero Pop, ya que aparte de sobresalir con el tema \u201cMe duele escuchar tu nombre\u201d en la versi\u00f3n duranguense, se arriesgaron a grabar la versi\u00f3n Pop de esta melod\u00eda consiguiendo de inmediato, resultados inimaginables.

El primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n llev\u00f3 por t\u00edtulo \u201cL\u00e1grimas del coraz\u00f3n\u201d; una melod\u00eda que aborda la melanc\u00f3lica situaci\u00f3n que muchos de nuestros paisanos viven en busca del sue\u00f1o americano. Posteriormente la agrupaci\u00f3n promocion\u00f3 el segundo sencillo de esta agrupaci\u00f3n titulado \u201cComo en los buenos tiempos\u201d una ranchera duranguense de la inspiraci\u00f3n del propio Jos\u00e9 Luis Terrazas, adem\u00e1s de Edgar Cort\u00e1zar y Adri\u00e1n Pieragotino.

MONTEZ DE DURANGO, los m\u00e1ximos exponentes de la m\u00fasica duranguense, presentan su m\u00e1s reciente producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica titulada: \u201cNOSOTROS SOMOS\u201d.

When Mike \u2013 previously of Reign and Winter of Torment \u2013 decided he wanted to form something new he turned to an old friend and previous bandmate from Liquefied Skeleton, Chas, the one time base player of Thus Defiled.

Swapping between a detuned 5-string and a punchy 4-string Iki provides the balls and the groove! After some gentle coaxing the band was able to get Stuart Songhurst previously of Epitome and Thus Defiled to bring his massive sound and outrageous double-kick to the party.

The Avengers were formed in San Francisco, in the first wave of American Punk. Penelope Houston was the lead singer, primary songwriter, and her persona was a large part of the draw for the act. The other band members were James Wilsey (bass), D. Furious (drums), and Greg Ingraham (guitar). Critic Greil Marcus once said The Avengers were, \"...San Francisco's best punk band - in their moments, they were, you knew, better than any other band playing that night anywhere in the world.\" The Avengers gained much publicity when they opened for the Sex Pistols in San Francisco, for their legendary final show at Winterland. The Avengers' 4-song EP was also produced by Steve Jones (of the Sex Pistols) in 1979 on White Noise Records. Their discography also contains an earlier 3-song EP (on Dangerhouse Records) from 1977, a full album called \"The Avengers\" from 1981, a compilation of unreleased tracks and outtakes called \"The Avengers Died for Your Sins\" in 1999 on Lookout! Records, and a second compilation titled \"The American in Me\" on DBK Works (2004). Houston and Ingraham have reunited and currently perform as The Avengers with bassist Joel Reader (MXT, Pansy Division) and drummer Luis Illades (Pansy Division) touring the US and Europe. 2. Perhaps the first band to be called The Avengers was an American group from Bakersfield, California. The first incarnation came together in 1964, as a surf six-piece. Where the name came from is unknown, but the hip British TV series 'The Avengers' had started running on the BBC two years earlier. The group soon latched on to the new sound of the British Invasion and bands like The Beatles, but also American acts like Paul Revere & the Raiders and The Music Machine. Between 1965 and 1967 The Avengers released five 45s and played support slots for the likes of The Beach Boys, The Animals, The Seeds and The Music Machine. They didn't have a hit, but their song \"Be a Caveman\" has become legendary in garage circuits for having the sort of lyric you'd think everyone would write but never really did. Other songs that have turned up on garage compilations are \"It's Hard to Hide\" and its b-side \"Open Your Eyes\". The Avengers had unusually short hair, because they were still in school and were afraid to get suspended. 3. Another early band named The Avengers were based in Wellington, New Zealand and were active from 1966 until 1969. They had a string of top ten hits on the New Zealand charts, with the most successful, \"Love, Hate, Revenge\", reaching #2 in August 1968. Overseas, however, they had considerably less success and they broke up after their second tour of Australia. During their career, they released two albums, Electric Recording in 1968 and Medallion in 1969, as well as a live album in 1968. In 2001, almost all of their studio material was collected on one compilation that also appeared under the name Electric Recording.", "otherInfo": "Ivy Room Presents \n**MASKS REQUIRED**"}, {"Address": "90 Old Courthouse Square, Santa Rosa, CA 95404", "Artist": "DJ Cal ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11542649.jpeg", "Coordinates": [38.4404749, -122.713083], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Edm, Open Format, Top40, Trap, Hip Hop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "DJ CAL at Perch + Plow", "moreBioInfo": "A native of Sonoma County, DJ CAL is from Bay Area / North Bay.

It was her passion and her sensitivity through her vocals that he learned the subtleties and nuance that could be expressed through song. By the age of 7, he displayed great acumen as a musician by mastering the ancient Persian Percussion instrument, the Tombac. However even more fascinating than his prodigious instrumentation, was the way in which he began to sing at such a range of octaves that he had almost absorbed the subtleties and power of the Tombac used for centuries as a storytelling device. Indeed, it was rare to hear a male voice that had such distinct high and low octaves usually reserved for those rare voices. Upon seeing him perform he was invited to learn the ancient musical techniques from a group of dedicated musicians who mentored him for several years. By the age of 12, he added violin to his repertoire and with an unquenchable thirst and natural talent it wasn\u2019t long before he embraced the piano and the guitar. His sense of ownership of the instruments he played and his unusual vocal abilities led to composing music tailored to his own sensibilities as a musician and artist. Performing has taken on new hues recently and he through acting he was recently featured in the lead role in a short film directed by Yancey Arias, appropriately entitled, \"Success Driven\u201d. The film which was written by Scott J. Foster also features actors, Steven Bauer and Serena Scott Thomas. The charming story while fictional is based on a character not unlike Mohammad and explores a young man\u2019s journey from Iran to Hollywood on his quest to find success and fame as a singer in Hollywood. With a Fall 2012 release, the producers are confident to platform the film through Sundance, Cannes and other prestigious competitions and festivals world-wide. To coincide with the film, Mr. Molaei will release his first single produced by Elan Morrisson, in which he wrote the music and provides the vocals with lyrics by Scott J. Foster. The single is feathered through the film as the soundtrack. Couturier Lloyd Klein most recently encouraged Mr. Molaei to model for his new Menswear Campaign also set to launch in Fall of 2012 and has been photographed by the very talented lens man Robert Voltaire for that campaign.

It\u2019s his youthful energy, attention to song structure and melodic content that elevates him above the rest. After nearly a decade without releasing new studio recordings, McKee returns with his six-track EP, Symbol, out Friday, September 17 on Mythmaker Records in conjunction with Cruzen Street Records. \u201cThese are my interpretations of tunes that really inspired me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI wanted to give listeners a chance to hear what I hear when I listen to this music. I also wanted to branch out a bit and include music that isn\u2019t originally for acoustic guitar.\u201d While Symbol is a collection of inspired renditions, they are important song choices; artists that deeply influence McKee and song\u2019s that connect to his musical past. He pulls from the catalogues of greats like Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, Billy McLaughlin and Prince. There\u2019s \u201cRagamuffin,\u201d the EP\u2019s lead single, which is a nod to one of McKee\u2019s biggest influences, Michael Hedges. McKee notes that \u201cMichael was not only a revolutionary guitarist on the technical side, his ability to compose for solo guitar was also genius. Most importantly though, he was able to search inside of himself and consistently pull up very human and evocative themes that made him a true artist. I\u2019ll always be grateful for his music.\u201d One track that might catch fans by surprise on Symbol is McKee\u2019s gorgeous rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d In 2012, McKee played alongside Prince in his band on the \u201cWelcome 2 Australia\u201d tour with the song being one of the setlist highlights. \u201cI had originally come up with the \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 arrangement to open the shows with while I was on tour with Prince in Australia,\u201d recalls McKee. \u201cI have played it occasionally since then while touring and figured I should finally get a recording of it down. One thing that I learned from Prince while we were on the road is that we both really admire Joni Mitchell. I used that as a reference when trying to describe what I do. Although some of what I do on the guitar is technically demanding, I don\u2019t ever really want that to overshadow the music.\u201d Another standout from Symbol is Mckee\u2019s take on \u201cChattanooga\u201d by acclaimed guitarist Preston Reed. \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018Chattanooga\u2019 by Preston Reed is one of the finest fingerstyle guitar pieces ever written,\u201d says McKee. \u201cIt\u2019s just loaded with texture, harmony, percussion, and melody. I love the key changes and chromaticism between some of the chords. This tune really inspired me a lot.\u201d McKee, like many, was infatuated with the Rocky IV soundtrack, specifically the Vince DiCola compositions \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage.\u201d For Symbol, McKee and DiCola joined forces to craft \u201cRocky IV Medley.\u201d \u201cThat was about as surreal as it gets for me,\u201d says McKee. \u201cI became a fan of Vince\u2019s work when I was six years old and I bought the soundtrack to the film on cassette. I used to listen to it all the time on my Sony Walkman and I really found that my favorite tunes were the instrumental tracks which were \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cTraining Montage\u201d from Vince. Those tunes awakened my mind to the possibility of being moved by music with no words. To be able to recreate those tunes with the electric guitar and play with Vince is really something I could never have dreamed of.\u201d Andy McKee entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique. McKee\u2019s crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today\u2019s most unique and influential artists. His song \u201cDrifting\u201d became one of the first YouTube viral videos with almost 60 million views. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK. He also curates his own annual guitar retreat called Musicarium.

Behind the northern California native\u2019s powerful, edgy vocals is a candid, bubbly personality, along with a natural, effervescent stage personality inherited from a family filled with performers.

McGee began writing songs and soliciting material for her six-song EP, perfecting her sound into a unique fusion of country, soul and rock that would reflect her edgy roots and support her powerhouse vocals. \u201cRun Right Back To You,\u201d which boasts McGee as the sole writer, is among the standouts on the project. McGee recorded tracks for the EP in 2014 at Ronnie's Place in Nashville, alongside seasoned musicians who have performed with Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan, among others. \u201cI wanted to blend my love of hard rock and country together,\u201d McGee says of the project. \u201cI have this heavy-hitting, gravelly tone in my voice, and I didn\u2019t want to lose that side of me. But country has always been my favorite genre of music. That\u2019s where I want to be, but I want to bring a bit of that old style of rock with me.\u201d Toree's first single, \"Amen\" gained airplay on radio stations in California, the midwest, and Canada, and climbed to the #1 slot on 95.3 KRTY's 'Hot 9 @ 9' segment for several days in a row. It has also gained the attention of Sirius/XM radio, as well as local news stations which have featured her music and story.

Formed in 2013, the band is headed by front man Chris Crabb and supported by Alex Palazzo, David Maemone - Keys, Frank Ojeda-bass, and Jay Tibbitts-drums. The Strike released their debut album \"Faint of Heart\" in June of 2017, which was met with great enthusiasm nationally. The success of the record allowed them to expand their presence into Los Angeles and the greater Mountain West region and has put them on the radar as one of the up and coming bands to watch for. On August 17th 2018, their song \u201cHuman Right\u201d from the album was featured in Netflix\u2019s original movie \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d In less than one month, the song was streamed over 1 million times on Spotify alone, and well over a million times across all platforms. It was \u201cShazamed\u201d over 20k times in the month following the release of the movie. Among those who saved Human Right to their library, it is listened to at an average of 10+ times. It was featured on Spotify\u2019s New Alt Playlist (700k+ subscribers), as well as the US Viral Top 50 Chart. In the summer of 2017, they were selected to play at the 27th annual Qingdao Beer Festival in China where they performed to thousands of festival goers for a month and a half. Their music is now being circulated across Asia. In early 2018 The Strike was hand selected by Quincy Jones to play a three month residency at Q's Bar and Lounge in Dubai. There they were able to win over fans from all over the globe. They played 60 shows in 82 days while in the UAE. The Strike is known for their captivating live performances.
