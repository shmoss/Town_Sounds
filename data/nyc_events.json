He\u2019s been a staple in the NY/NJ club scene going on 20 years. For a DJ-Producer, that\u2019s a lifetime. But for Louie DeVito, it is simply his life. On any given weekend night, he can be found playing sets to packed rooms, wall-to-wall bodies writhing on the dance floor. That is when DeVito is his happiest. \u201cI love feeling the vibe of the room,\u201d he explains. Big or small, domestic or international, he loves them all. \u201cI\u2019ve played rooms of 350 to rooms of thousands. Playing good music, reading the crowd, giving them what they want \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d That ideology of \u201cgiving them what they want\u201d has made him seem like a \u201csellout\u201d to some of his fellow DJs. His compilation \u201cN.Y.C. Underground Party,\u201d released on his own independent label Elastik, has sold more than 500,000 copies to date \u2013 enough to land him in the Guinness Book of World Records for all-time best-selling DJ mix compilation. Ironically, there\u2019s nothing \u201cunderground\u201d about the mix. DeVito admits this himself, laughing about it. \u201cFor the hardcore, serious clubber, there is nothing \u2018underground\u2019 about it. But it depends on who you\u2019re asking. For the average mainstream clubber, it\u2019s very underground \u2013 no dance remixes of pop hits here.\u201d DeVito\u2019s bread and butter comes from catering to a crowd craving an indulgent blend of radio-friendly club smashes. Big dance anthems with soaring vocals and huge stadium-sizes synths and riffs, with the requisite massive build-up and break. \u201cThis big room sound is what I\u2019m into playing these days,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely popular. It also sounds good on any and every sound system. I want to see hands in the air, people dancing and going crazy. This sound makes it happen.\u201d DeVito recently released a remix of Sweet Rains feat. Reina \u201cForever\u201d on indie label Lafayette Street Records. \u201cReina\u2019s big vocals on this track leant itself to a big-room, anthemic remix. I worked with my partner Alessandro Calemme. I\u2019m proud of this remix and love the response it gets.\u201d DeVito\u2019s weekly podcast iluvhouse is currently getting thousands of downloads weekly and is in the Top 50 on iTunes in the genre.

However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are, in fact, a few fucks the guys do give when it comes to their music. Which they have no problem showing.In the studio, Sedz and Fish channel their unabashed, fuck-all attitudes into tracks like their sultry debut single \u201cFace Down\u201d, and the lush vocal cut \u201cEcho\u201d. The guys coin an atmospheric and deep-leaning sound that\u2019s suited to no one particular environment. As Fish tells it, \u201cyou should be able to enjoy it everywhere.\u201d Mates since childhood, Cut Snake grew up on the Gold Coast of Australia; surfing professionally and competing against each other from the time they were 12. In this time, they developed the hilarious banter and incredible dynamic that is still prevalent in interviews and on stage. The guys got into dance music while they were touring the world for surf contests and quickly grew passionate about the underground scenes from each country they visited. With plenty of time waiting for waves, they fine-tuned their production skills from beachfront bungalows, giving their music a fresh feel and their live show a vibe like no other. Outside of their wildly successful surf careers, Sedz channeled his passion and focus for the sport into his music production, and for that he\u2019s known as the \u201cmad scientist\u201d of the duo. Fish is known for his web series, Followthefish.tv. His wild personality and contagious laugh have made him one of the biggest personalities in the surfing industry to date. Now that Cut Snake has relocated stateside and inked a deal with Three Six Zero / Warner Bros. Records, the guys flout the seriousness of the scene in every way possible. Their crazy video antics have amassed a cult following in their home country of Australia and given the guys an edge on US turf.

At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium.

She was born Karen Michelle Johnston on February 24, 1962, in Dallas, Texas, the daughter of a carpenter and a woman who would end up committing her to a psychiatric hospital twenty-something years later. She graduated from high school in Gilmer, Texas and received her bachelor's degree in the Oral Interpretation of Poetry from the University of Texas in Austin. She was raised in a strict Mormon household and worked her way through college to pay for tuition. Michelle's stage name dates back to the name she gave when arrested in 1984 at a protest for fair housing during the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, California. Her nickname was 'Chel, so Michelle Shocked was a play on words intended to resemble the phrase \"shell shocked\". The front cover of her (arguably) best-known album, Short Sharp Shocked, shows her restrained by the chokehold of a San Francisco policeman in a supposedly authentic photograph of this incident. However, some indie music critics of the time observed that the style of this image showed a strong similarity to a photo that appeared on an album cover from British punk band Chaos UK. This led some to assert that she plagiarized the concept, but the accusation was never answered nor seriously pursued.

There is a vine, Liana, which grows from tree to tree, holding the forest together through all of nature\u2019s changing moods. These vines form a net, which hovers 20 or so feet above ground level. Monkeys and other adventurous life forms often jump from great heights only to land comfortably in this net of vines. Liana can become so heavy, that it pulls down older and weaker trees, constantly catalyzing new life in the rain forest. For the Ghanaian people, Liana has been a symbol of strength and unity, across a great network of life. Joe Galeota brought me to Ghana in 2003 as part of his annual trip to experience Ewe music, dance and culture. We studied at the Dagbe Cultural Center with the Agbeli family in Kopeiya, a village in the southeastern Volta region. We were introduced to the ancestors of the Agbeli family and their land. We studied with master drummer Emmanuel Agbeli and lead dancer Victor Agbeli. While in Ghana we also had the privilege to study at the Dargara Bewaa Cultural Center, outside of Accra. This is the house of master xylophonist Bernard Woma. We studied the Gyil, a fourteen keyed balafon made from completely organic materials. The Gyil appears once on this record in the \u201cTodjo Suite\u201d. It was at Bernard\u2019s house where I began to arrange traditional Gyil music for the guitar. Upon returning to Philadelphia I continued to study and arrange what I had learned. In the blossoming Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia, I began to teach this music, holding weekly workshops for free. This naturally grew into a bi-weekly happening where the communal traditions of Ewe social music were performed. This ensemble became the group Leana Song. The way we spell Leana, was the way I pictured the word. Though traditionally spelled \u2018Liana\u2019, \u2018Leana\u2019 has meaning when you split the letters apart. Le, a term used for the raffia leggings worn by adjogbo (adzohu) dancers, and A\u00f1a, coming from the bat\u00e1 tradition and referring to the spirit within the drum. This works well because Ewe music brought Leana Song together and bat\u00e1 music has sustained us. This first volume of Orisha Love Songs, primarily has arrangements of Cuban Lucum\u00ed songs, with three arrangements of Ewe music. We look forward to creating the next volume of Orisha Love Songs, and we thank you for your support of our work. Ashe Moyuba.

Blues Music Magazine calls them \u201cthe best little big band in the blues.\u201d On record and on stage, Roomful of Blues\u2014led by master guitarist Chris Vachon for the past 22 years\u2014continues to deliver its bone-shaking mix of original songs and carefully chosen covers ranging from jump, swing and proto rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to funky, contemporary blues. Their impeccable musicianship and larger-than-life vocals have earned Roomful of Blues five Grammy Award nominations and a slew of other accolades, including seven Blues Music Awards. Twice, the prestigious DownBeat International Critics\u2019 Poll has selected them as Best Blues Band. And now, even after 18 previous releases and thousands of live shows, Roomful of Blues continues to evolve, as they return with In A Roomful Of Blues, their first new studio album since 2011. In A Roomful Of Blues, the band\u2019s sixth release on Alligator Records, was produced by Vachon and features 13 wide-ranging songs, including nine band-composed originals\u2014more than on any previous Roomful album. Eight songs were written or co-written by Vachon (including one authored with vocalist Phil Pemberton) plus one each by sax player Alek Razdan and keyboardist Rusty Scott. From the rocking We\u2019d Have A Love Sublime to the funkified You Move Me to the closing-time lament She Quit Me Again to the up-to-the-minute Phone Zombies, In A Roomful Of Blues is filled with soaring blues, zydeco twists, late-night ballads, Latin-tinged funk and a touch of vintage, fifth-gear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Roomful of Blues guitarist Chris Vachon first joined Roomful in 1990, and has been leading the band since 1998. Guitar Player says Vachon\u2019s guitar playing \u201cburns with explosive solos and a delightfully greasy sense of rhythm.\u201d The band has maintained its signature sound through great musicianship and a stellar horn section\u2014featuring tenor and alto saxophonist Rich Lataille, who first joined the band in 1970. Lataille\u2019s masterful playing can evoke either the fat-toned, honking sax of the glory days of early rock or the cool elegance of big band swing jazz. While Roomful of Blues has always been one of the tightest, most joyful blues ensembles in the world, they have never sounded fresher or stronger than with the current line-up. Along with Vachon and Lataille, the band includes vocalist Phil Pemberton, baritone and tenor saxophonist Alek Razdan, trumpeter Carl \u201cGeerz\u201d Gerhard, bassist John Turner, drummer Chris Anzalone and keyboardist Rusty Scott. The long and winding road which leads to the Roomful of Blues of today can be followed all the way back to 1967 when a group of southern Rhode Island teenagers with a shared passion for the blues formed a straight-ahead Chicago-style electric blues band to explore the music of their heroes. They added a horn section (including Rich Lataille) in 1970 and released their self-titled debut album in 1977 on Island Records (reissued on Hyena Records), which brought them to the attention of fans and critics from coast to coast. Recording for Rounder Records\u2019 Bullseye Blues and Varrick labels between 1980 and 2001, the band cut nine albums that won them international fame and major rock radio airplay. They\u2019ve gigged with stars ranging from bluesmen B.B. King, Otis Rush and Stevie Ray Vaughan to rockers Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana. The band has performed in cities from coast to coast, and traveled abroad to 22 countries including Lebanon, Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and Russia. Since Roomful joined the Alligator Records family in 2003, their popularity has continued to increase.

His earliest exposure to music came at home, thanks to an extended family of musicians and ready access to a wealth of Colombian genres. By the age of 12, Torres was performing with various Bogot\u00e1 ensembles, developing techniques that allowed him to quickly adapt to the demands of jazz, pop music, and salsa. A classically trained percussionist, he earned a degree in Music Composition from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s esteemed Universidad Javeriana. Before departing for the U.S. in 1999, the resourceful young artist had become an established figure on Colombia\u2019s fertile music scene, backing leading Colombian performers while serving as an arranger and music director for his country\u2019s highly regarded telenovelas (TV soap operas) and films.\nShortly after arriving in the U.S., his career took a dramatic turn when he was tapped by famed trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval to join his group. Torres spent four years touring the world and recording with the jazz great, polishing his ever-expanding talents while attracting the attention of a long list of renowned artists with whom he would eventually collaborate. Over time, he would perform with a veritable \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the jazz, Latin pop, and salsa world, including such luminaries as Tito Puente, Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker, Don Byron, Claudio Roditi, Richard Bona, Poncho Sanchez, Lila Downs, Marc Anthony, Thal\u00eda, and his country\u2019s own international superstar, Shakira. His talents have also been featured in concerts with the Boston Pops, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Nashville Symphony and at a host of music festivals around the world.\nMore recently Torres was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Classical Album with the production \"Regreso,\" an incredible project done in collaboration with the Nueva Filarmon\u00eda of Bogot\u00e1."}, {"Address": "975 Main St, Holbrook, NY 11741", "Artist": "Nate Charlie Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8983203.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.80815459999999, -73.0741117], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie Pop, Soft Rock, Reggae, Rock, Acoustic, Acoustic Alternative, Indie Rock, Alternative, Pop Punk, Folk, Classic Rock, Indie Folk, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Irish Times Pub", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102563761-nate-charlie-music-at-the-irish-times-pub?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Nate Charlie is an acoustic singer/songwriter act that performs a variety of cover songs (from the 60's to now) in his own unique way.

Stephen's new album titled \"Said & Done\" was released on February 27, 2016. The new LP draws on inspiration from his time in the southern United States as well as pop and Americana styles. Stephen began his musical career as a drummer, and his transition to a songwriter has weaved a percussive element into his guitar playing and singing. Since humble beginnings as a solo act around Central New York, Stephen has since finely tuned the performance and arrangement of his songs to compliment both bold full band shows and intimate acoustic events. Stephen\u2019s live shows distinctly blend singer-songwriter charm and comedic wit, leaving listeners wanting more. Encore Magazine says, \u201cWhether his lyrics flourish with optimism or heartache, Stephen Babcock\u2019s music infuses the listener with an all-encompassing positive feeling\u201d. With influences ranging from John Mayer to Otis Redding, Stephen has a sound that is relatable and enjoyable to all fans of pop music. Critics agree, stating that \u201cHis youthful vocals parallel those of Jason Mraz, as does the cadence of his songs\u201d (Encore Magazine). Stephen\u2019s debut album, entitled \u201cDreams, Schemes & Childhood Memories,\u201d was released on August 31, 2011. It was followed shortly after by the EP \u201cLost,\u201d released July 19, 2013. Stephen went on a touring frenzy during that period, playing up and down the east coast of the US as well as the United Kingdom and hitting numerous singer-songwriter festivals. Stephen\u2019s EP, \u201cWishful Thinking,\u201d was written and recorded upon returning home from touring and was released in May 2014. After taking the following winter to write and record, Stephen took another full tour of the southern US in the summer of 2015. Now with his new album \"Said & Done\" ready for release, things are on the rise. Already drawing comparisons to Brett Dennen, Dawes, and John Mayer, the album is sure to be an indie pop favorite in 2016.", "otherInfo": "Stephen Babcock"}, {"Address": "34 Indian Head Rd, Kings Park, NY 11754", "Artist": "Karen Bella ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11071143.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.8832816, -73.253937], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Legends Bar & Grill", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102499928-karen-bella-at-legends-bar-and-grill?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "New York-based Karen Bella, is one of the hardest working singer-songwriters in the business, and after enduring a 2020 filled with set-backs, many may say she is also one of the most resilient. Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

The quartet of Horvath, guitarist Dave Whitehead, drummer Chris Ryan and bassist Christopher Rousseau enthralls listeners with irresistible hooks and captivates them with intelligent layers of sound. In 2001, The Council released its debut album Coloursound (The Sinclair Recording Co.). Coloursound made its radio debut on Little Steven\u2019s internationally syndicated radio show \u201cUnderground Garage\" and the first single \u201cSitting on a Cloud\u201d, was named the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d in April 2002. In 2006 the band released its second full-length album, The Fall Parade (Groove Disques Records), which was nominated for \u201cBest New Release\u201d and \u201cBest Album\u201d by the Asbury Park Music Awards. The album quickly made its way to the Billboard Garage Rock charts on the strength of its first single \u201cPinkerton\u2019s Assorted Colours\u201d which entered at number one and propelled the The Fall Parade to number nine. Both the single and album remained in the Top 10 charting for three months straight. The second single \u201cStrawberry Smell\u201d, which is featured on the soundtrack of award-winning film I\u2019m Reed Fish (2007), continues to spin regularly on Underground Garage and radio stations across North America. In 2012 The Anderson Council completed and released their 3rd full length album, Looking at the Stars. Recorded in Highland Park, New Jersey by Kurt Reil (leader of the Grip Weeds, and producer of Mark Lindsey and The Smithereens) on Sinclair Records, \u201cLooking at the Stars\u201d featured 13 new songs ranging from high-energy 60\u2019s power pop to 70\u2019s Mod Revival to 00\u2019s British re-invasion. Their video for the single and lead off track \"Don't You Think\" received extensive views online on YouTube and in the blogosphere. The single also appeared in the Canadian film The Right Kind of Wrong (2013). The record continued to surge, behind the support Little Steven Van Zandt, who deemed a deeper cut, \"Gardening Man\" the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d on his Underground Garage Sirius XM radio (channel 21) and syndicated radio show. Combine that with a public endorsement from Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, annual appearances at multiple metro area music festivals and all was looking good in the power pop world for The Anderson Council. Over the next two years, the band stayed busy and productive playing shows and kept their name in the public eye. They made appearances on several tribute records, recording their versions of songs by Elvis Costello, Bobby Sutliff, The Posies, New Jersey\u2019s own, The Critters and most recently, the Canadian rock band, Sloan. In 2014 Christopher Rousseau joined the fold, taking over bass duties from long time member Rob Farrell. Energized, the band brought Christopher up to speed, and later that year, the band embarked on writing and demoing new material. The result is 2015\u2019s Listening Party!, a six song EP which gave their fans some well deserved tracks to spin while awaiting the next album. The EP tracklisting was unique in that each member contributed one original and chose one cover. In 2016, fresh from signing with Marty Scott\u2019s JEM Records, the band re entered The House of Vibes to cut some tracks. Scott\u2019s intention was to introduce the rest of the world to the sounds of The Anderson Council without having to purchase their catalog. Thus the idea behind Assorted Colours, an aural history of The Anderson Council was born. Under the stewardship of Reil, the band began a massive re-mastering of tracks from the first three albums. With the intention of including three tracks from each previously release along with 4 newly recorded \u201cjems\u201d. Assorted Colours combines the old with the new sounds in a seamless presentation. The remastering adds punch to previously released songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Like The Sun\u201d and \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d while the new tracks \u201cGirl on The Northern Line\u201d, \u201cI Never Feel\u201d, \u201cMagical\u201d and \u201cFire Island\u201d simply sparkle. The Anderson Council\u2019s Assorted Colours is a vibrant palette of psyche power pop and will be released on July 15th, 2016.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "Bay Shore, NY", "Artist": "Jimmy Kenny and The Pirate Beach Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8813388.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7250986, -73.2453946], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Tropical, Beach, Island, Country, Trop Rock, Reggae", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Private Event - House Party", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102610015-jimmy-kenny-and-the-pirate-beach-band-at-private-event?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "The Ultimate Beach Party Tribute to Jimmy Buffett, Kenny Chesney and Zac Brown Band.", "otherInfo": "Private Event - House Party"}, {"Address": "44 Wilson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Court Order ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11525150.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.702624, -73.929611], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Metal", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Court Order/Patterns of Decay", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102738016-court-order-at-gold-sounds?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Formed in 2019 Brooklyn, NY \"Infinite Decay\" (2020) \"Court Order (2020) \"Split Between A Dream And A Failure (2021)", "otherInfo": "Patterns of Decay\nCourt Order\nEternal Throne\nBrass Knuckle Brigade\n\nWe're filming a video for a new track on this date for our upcoming album - be sure to roll out early and party with us!!

Orleans began as a trio in 1972 in Woodstock NY. Guitarist John Hall, drummer Wells Kelly and multi-instrumentalist Larry Hoppen played tirelessly all over the Northeast and up / down the Eastern \u201ccorridor\u201d for nine months, then added Lance Hoppen (Larry\u2019s brother) fresh out of high school on bass to form the quartet that would record its debut LP in 1973 at the legendary Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama. Orleans found its core audience touring the clubs and college circuit of the Northeast US, crossing paths with other up-and-comers such as Bonnie Raitt, Tom Waits, and Hall & Oates. Rolling Stone called Orleans \"the best unrecorded band in America\". Showcase performances in NYC gave rise to a recording contract with ABC Dunhill Records and the release of an eponymous debut album in 1973. But it was not until Orleans was produced by Chuck Plotkin, then head of A&R for Asylum Records, that the band scored its first Top 40 hit with \"Let There Be Music\" in early 1975. The follow up single \"Dance With Me\" brought Orleans into the Top 5 and the mainstream of American pop music. Atypical of the high-energy, earthy, R&B/Rock 'n' Roll mix of styles they had been previously identified with, \"Dance With Me\" cast the band in a more \"soft-rock\" light and landed them a tour with Melissa Manchester, when they really were more at home on tour with bands such as Little Feat. It was the smash hit \"Still the One\" that cemented Orleans' relationship with the American public. While the single was climbing the charts all the way to #2, the band did a major cross-country tour with label-mate Jackson Browne. However, within a year internal stresses prompted guitarist/songwriter Hall to leave the band in search of a solo career, as \"Still the One\" played ceaselessly as the ABC TV network theme song. Since then it has been used for countless commercials and movie soundtracks. The Hoppen brothers and Kelly reunited the band and, in 1979, produced the Top 10 hit \"Love Takes Time\", continuing to tour with the likes of Stephen Stills and Chicago. Collectively, the three Orleans' hits have been aired over 7 million times. One of the many signatures of Orleans was and still is harmony guitar riffs and two serious players trading rhythm and lead between them, all seamlessly. Larry and John were, for most of this still\u2013active band\u2019s 35-year-and\u2013counting career, those players. When John Hall left for a solo stint in 1977, Orleans found Dennis \u201cFly\u2019 Amero, a lefty, upside-down Strat player (in the manner of Jimi Hendrix) who took over for several years. After original drummer Wells Kelly passed away in October 1984, Larry, Lance and John played at his Memorial event. Out of this, they decided to work together as Orleans again, starting with a Nashville album. From 1985 through 2006 (when John got elected to the US Congress \u2013 D, NY-19) the group always included the three original members. Over those years, another 8 albums were released, always containing new material. In 2001 the band added Lane Hoppen, the third brother, as a permanent member. Shortly after, Charlie Morgan \u2013 drummer with Elton John for 13 years \u2013 also joined the group. Early in 2006, as John Hall began his election campaign, Fly Amero was asked back by the band \u2013 including John - roughly 25 years after Fly\u2019s first \u2018term\u2019. Fly agreed, and a smooth transition ensued. (Orleans\u2019 2006 \u201cWe\u2019re Still Havin\u2019 Fun\u201d DVD features BOTH John and Fly.) Fly and Larry\u2019s guitar chemistry is obvious, as is the whole group\u2019s camaraderie. Besides being a great guitarist, songwriter and singer with a strong blues/R&B soulful tilt, Fly is great with a crowd and has a Gold Record for comedy music featuring his parody lyrics. Here in 2008, John is up for Congressional re-election and Fly is a permanent Orleans member, as are Charlie, Lane and original mainstays Lance and Larry (who is the voice on all the radio hits, by the way). Thirty-five years in, Orleans\u2019 trademarked slogan couldn\u2019t be more appropriate: \u201cWe\u2019re Still Havin\u2019 Fun\u201d. It\u2019s also the title of their new (and debut) DVD and latest CD (related to the DVD).

Formed in the mid 1990s, the band soon became a highly acclaimed musical force on the East Coast underground Jazz and Jam Band scene. This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut. The Bowery Ballroom in New York City along with various venues in Boston have hosted DBB recently as the main musical attraction. DBB were James \u201cFuzz\u201d San Giovanni, guitar/vocals, Eric Kalb, drums, Benj LeFevre, bass, Jen Durkin, vocals, Rob Somerville, sax/vocals, Rob Volo, trombone/guitar/vocals, Cyrus Madan, keyboards and Johnny Durkin, percussion.

Adalberto's relaxed and flawless lead vocals are amongst the best in salsa, and for over two decades he has sessioned as a coro (chorus) singer on countless New York recordings. His early influences included the great Cuban vocalists Beny Mor\u00e9 and Miguelito Cun\u00ed (b. 8 May 1920, Pinar del R\u00edo, Cuba, d. 5 March 1984, Havana, Cuba). Santiago started his professional career singing with trios and playing bass and guitar. After stints with the bands of Chu\u00edto V\u00e9lez, Willie Rodr\u00edguez and Willie Rosario, his career really took off when he joined Ray Barretto's band. Between 1966-72, Adalberto made seven albums (excluding compilations) with Ray Barretto. In late 1972, Adalberto and four other members of Barretto's band departed to found Tipica 73. He appeared on three of their albums before disagreement over musical direction led him, and three other band members, to split during the mid-70s to form Los Kimbos. Meanwhile, Santiago sang lead vocals on two critically acclaimed charanga albums, \"Fantasia Africana/African Fantasy\" and \"Our Heritage - Nuestra Herencia\", by flautist, composer and producer Lou P\u00e9rez. Los Kimbos were reputed to be a tough working band and had a sound reminiscent of both the pre-split Ray Barretto band and Tipica 73. With them, Adalberto recorded 1976's \"Los Kimbos\" and \"The Big Kimbos With Adalberto Santiago\" in1977. That year he made his solo debut on \"Adalberto\", which was produced by Ray Barretto and contained two of his own compositions. Los Kimbos continued under the leadership of timbales player Orestes Vilat\u00f3 and released two further albums- \"Hoy y Ma\u00f1ana\" (1978) and \"Aquacero Ne Me Moja\" (1979). Santiago sang lead on one track on \"Louie Ram\u00edrez y sus Amigos\" by Louie Ram\u00edrez. In 1979, Adalberto and Ram\u00edrez co-produced his solo follow-up, \"Adalberto Featuring Popeye El Marino\". The same year, he reunited with Ray Barretto on \"Rican/Struction\". Ray produced Adalberto's next solo album, \"Feliz Me Siento\", the following year. Sonora Matancera member, Javier V\u00e1zquez, produced, arranged, directed and played piano on the rootsy Adalberto Santiago, which was Adalberto's contribution to the early 80s tipico (typical) salsa revival. In 1982, he teamed up with bandleader/bongo player Roberto Roena for \"Super Apollo\" 47:50. Santiago co-produced \"Calidad\" with Papo Lucca, who also played piano, arranged one track and oversaw musical direction. His \"Cosas Del Alma\" was an album of lush boleros which included his third recorded version of the classic 'Alma Con Alma' (previously contained on Barretto's \"The Message\" and \"Gracias\"). He returned to harder-edged urban salsa in 1985 on \"Mas Sabroso\". Adalberto did his own mature version of salsa rom\u00e1ntica on the classy Sex Symbol, with production, arrangements, musical direction and piano by the ubiquitous Isidro Infante. In 1990, he again performed 'Alma Con Alma', this time arranged by Infante in a salsa rom\u00e1ntica style for Louie Ram\u00edrez's second album entitled \"Louie Ram\u00edrez y sus Amigos\". Santiago has written songs for a number of the albums on which he has appeared, both as bandleader and solo artist, and provided compositions for other artists to record, such as Joe Cuba. Adalberto has remained true to his Latin roots and a statement he made in 1977 is still relevant in the 90s: 'I want to bring a truly Latin message to the people; this is what I do best and the structure of Latin music is best suited to my singing style'.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2896 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11207", "Artist": "Ceky Viciny ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6787614, -73.8876867], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "EL AMBIENTE", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022651827-ceky-viciny-at-el-ambiente?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "177 Vanderbilt Ave, Kings County, NY 11205", "Artist": "Lee Taylor ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11613236.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.692643, -73.9694925], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Wild Woman Party ", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102800334-lee-taylor-at-brooklyn-music-kitchen?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Vaccinations or Negative Covid Test Required.

Bram (drums) vervolledigde de band in de zomer van 2014. In deze bezetting schreef de band heel wat nieuwe nummers, wat midden 2015 resulteerde in een eerste online EP. Na de release hiervan speelden we op heel wat lokale festivals en muziekcaf\u00e9s in o.a. Antwerpen, Aalst, Gent, Ninove en zelfs Den Haag. We begonnen 2016 in de studio voor de opnames van ons eerste full album, dat momenteel wordt gemixt en gemastered.

Amassing an army of instantly recognisable hit singles, with over 13 billion global streams, over 60 million singles sales, and 5 BRIT Award nominations, Jonas has cemented his name as a main stage DJ and pop powerhouse. With over one billion streams just in 2020, joining an elite list of artists including The 1975 and Niall Horan, Jonas\u2019 debut album Blue also smashed its way to Gold status. But, with 2021 now in full swing, he\u2019s not about to rest on his laurels. A man on a mission, whose sights are firmly set for the top, this year is the start of a new era of hard graft and perseverance. His story is one of self-belief, self-improvement and talent\u2026. 2018 was a landmark year. He released \u2018Rise\u2019 featuring Jack & Jack, which was one of the summer\u2019s biggest global hits and owned the autumn with \u2018Polaroid\u2019 - his highly-anticipated collaboration with Liam Payne and Nashville actress Lennon Stella. The success of both hits was sandwiched between his huge collaboration \u2018Back & Forth\u2019 with chart-topping UK vocalist Becky Hill and Detroit house legend, MK. Debut album Blue soon followed, which featured collaborations with the likes of fast-rising songstress Nina Nesbitt, platinum-selling Canadian artist Jessie Reyez, multi-skilled singer/songwriter Zak Abel, Charlotte OC, and Grammy award-winning Puerto Rican rapper Jhay Cortez, alongside his previous multi-platinum selling hits. Jonas\u2019 album was also the recipient of the Brit Certified Breakthrough Award the following year. Off the back of Blue, Jonas\u2019 hard work and inspiring music continued to receive global success with singles featuring a combo of hot new artists, as well as household names. These included the brilliant \u2018Younger\u2019 featuring HRVY, \u2018Mistakes\u2019 featuring Paloma Faith, \u2018Naked\u2019 featuring MAX, \u2018What I Like About You\u2019 featuring Danish popstar Theresa Rex and \u2018Ritual\u2019, his much-loved collaboration with Ti\u00ebsto and Rita Ora. At the height of a hectic Ibiza season in 2019, Jonas added another string to his bow with the launch of his label, Electronic Nature. Having already established successful events, as well as releases from emerging talent including Jack Wins, Dark Heart and Jerome Price with more to come, Electronic Nature is a label to watch. Away from the studio and the charts, Jonas toured relentlessly all over the world. Clocking up the hours and miles, he\u2019s a firm fixture on festival mainstages worldwide, performing at the most legendary festivals . Not stopping there, Jonas has made his mark on Ibiza, having performed at hotspots Ushuaia, Cafe Mambo and has successfully hosted his Electronic Nature residency at superclub H\u00ef Ibiza. As we see a return to live performances, Jonas will be joining Tiesto and Zedd as a resident DJ at Zouk in Las Vegas. Locked down or not, his latest track \u2018Something Stupid\u2019 featuring AWA kicked off the year in style, holding no bars and providing joy for fans across the world. With the track firmly grounded in its dance roots, it smashed its way into homes worldwide as Jonas continues to bring fans on a new journey with him \u2013 inspiring, uplifting and spreading global positivity.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "128 Bedford St, Stamford, CT 06901", "Artist": "Sienna Rose ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11461470.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.0563163, -73.5388226], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Stamford Pride Drag Brunch", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102711848-sienna-rose-at-hudson-social-ct?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Sienna Rose is the Drag Pop Princess of Connecticut.

That he did throughout the \u201970s, becoming a fixture in the Village folk and rock scenes and getting tabbed as the next big thing to come out of that long-thriving artistic community. Writing in The New York Times, the great rock critic Robert Palmer called him \u201cone of the most gifted singer-songwriters to emerge from the New York scene in years.\u201d He made his recording debut in 1980 with his acclaimed self-titled LP on Arista Records, following it a year later with Golden Down. He also opened the Who\u2019s North American tour at the personal request of the band. In 1982, he signed to Geffen Records but got caught in record-biz limbo and didn\u2019t manage to release another record until 1991, when Columbia issued Places I Have Never Been. With the EP Hard Times in America in 1992, which became a cult favorite throughout Europe, Nile finally managed to jump off the major-label hamster wheel. Gathering together his resources over time, he managed to put out his first self-released album, Beautiful Wreck of the World in 1999. In 2006, Nile released Streets of New York, which some consider to be his best work to date, due to quality production and clever songwriting.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Their sound fuses the soul and bitterness of traditional Bachata with modern production.\nThey formed in 2015 as a group of local New Yorkers who simply wanted to bond over their love of Bachata. Over time they started to record songs of their own and decided to share them with the world.\nIn 2018, they released Dime Si Volver\u00e1s, their first collaboration with Dominican Producer Neutro Evans, implementing Dub-step inspired synth sounds and pulsating kick drums. This kicked off a series of performances all around New York City, at local festivals and in residencies at local bars and clubs.\nIn 2019, they continued this partnership to then create Trap-inspired Bachata in Mi Peor Castigo. That summer, Grupo Aurora performed in the Puerto Rican Festival in Bristol, PA in addition to the monthly residency at Harlem Nights and then a Weekly Residency at Verlaine.\nIn 2020, Grupo Aurora had grown a big following in New York City because of their energetic performances but the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to it. So they released Te Alejas de M\u00ed and D\u00f3nde Estar\u00e1s featuring Jack Marcin Wisniewski, as a thank you to their supporters, the latter of which has gone on to be Grupo Aurora's most successful track to date.

Every mystical journey eventually comes to a fork in the road. The seeker of life\u2019s destiny has two options: remain satisfied with whatever level of consciousness he has already attained, or push forward into ever-new domains of promise and possibility. 2014 sees dance music\u2019s best-known spiritual pilgrims, the Visionquest trio of Ryan Crosson, Lee Curtiss, and Shaun Reeves, bravely embarking upon that wondrous journey. Each member of this celebrated DJing and production team contributes a distinct yet interlocking vision that together forms a seamless, organic whole. Just think of Crosson\u2019s enthusiastic shuffle, Lee\u2019s soulful stare, Shaun\u2019s soft touch. Everything they craft has the same unmistakable flair: slow-burning, shape-shifting, expansive techno and house marked by compositional elegance and unabashed pop hooks. Although long-time partner and co-conspirator Seth Troxler has stepped aside to pursue other projects, 2013 was the biggest year ever for the four. Inspired by the passing of the Mayan calendar, the group embarked upon Visionquest 13, 13 dates where the boys not only played together the whole night, but curated a true multimedia experience. From London to Buenos Aires, from the American hinterland to the Chilean wilderness, Visionquest 13 was a Freudian trip into the deepest recesses of the Detroit rave unconscious, what Ibiza Voice described as a \u201ccollective expedition into the depths of your soul\u201d\u2014but with a sophisticated, modern twist. Their accomplishments are well-known and too many to list. For starters: a critically acclaimed 2011 Fabric mix; year-defining hit remixes for artists as diverse as Kiki, Wareika, Tracey Thorn, and David Lynch; showcases and dates in the biggest clubs and festivals around the world; and the creation of a now iconic-label that\u2019s played host to dancefloor weaponry from the likes of Benoit & Sergio, Life & Death, Dinky, and Laura Jones\u2014all this while each member maintained significant individual production and DJ careers. But, by definition, no journey dwells in the past. So in 2014 they launched Visionquest Special Editions, a limited-release, vinyl only label. Evoking the experimental sounds of the European techno avant-garde that first inspired the boys back in Detroit, the debut release, remixes of Montreal songwriter Quilla, features a stunning collaboration between Shaun and long-time hero Ricardo Villalobos. With Visionquest Special Editions we see the group at home at a breezy, gentle afterparty, not just igniting the club. As Visionquest winds around the corner into their bright future, they remain open and excited for what lies ahead.

He didnt take the show to the stage until he formed a 2 man rap group in 2004 (T.S.F.P.) along side long time homie Asshole Don, the two released some of the most shocking music to this day, getting much attention in the underground music circuit. The first concert they performed was in Freedom, NY at an underground Punk Rock music festival outdoors. TSFP played the next few years around night clubs and dives in Buffalo, getting mostly Tuesday and Wednesday night bookings starting at 11pm or later. The ability to draw small crowds of 50-100 people consistently on weeknights opened more doors of opportunity and led to better gigs, being offered weekend shows. In 2007 Personal issues led Asshole Don to depart from the group leaving Flatline to return to a solo career in music as he broadened and experimented with his sound, producing and mastering his craft over the next several years. In 2007 Flatline took 2nd place at Battle of the Bands held at Showplace Theater being the only rap act on the entire bill. In 2009 Flatline played nearly every weekend in WNY, playing 46 shows in 52 weeks, some back to back nights playing Buffalo Friday then Niagara Falls or Rochester the following night. Mid year he signed a 15 show booking contract with DTD Entertainment which then led to a meeting with ATA Management. Flatline signed a one year contract with ATA in September of 2009. The contract prohibited Flatline from continuing to book and perform shows which were not presented by the firm beyond his already booked schedule. The contract and agreement sat stagnant as did Flatlines career as he waited for bookings and record negotiations that never came. In 2010 Flatline brought together a super show to the local music scene called The Spook Show which would be held for the next year into 2011 the last Thursday of every month at Club Diablo in Downtown Buffalo, NY. The show held a wide variety of entertainment from live music, horror films, magic, comedy, burlesque, and even hardcore wrestling. Flatline still being under contract prevented him from booking his own concerts to play Live music, so Flatline found a loop hole as he Hosted the Spook Show and was strictly involved in the nightly BarFight / DeathMatches which were a part of the show experience. August 2010 Flatline formed Kamp Crystal Lake when he was asked to collaborate by new coming rapper who Flatline had booked on 2 previous Spook Shows. As he waited for his contract to expire with ATA, he set the plans in motion to make a huge impact returning to the stage and he did just that. The first concert Flatline would return was an event he put together for the upcoming release of \"Rotten Flesh\" Mind Possessing Instrumentals album. It was a Zombie Walk / After Party that took place in downtown Buffalo for his Birthday celebrating the end of his contractual ties and his return to the stage. He split his set performing track for track back and forth as the newly formed Kamp Crystal Lake. Flatline started booking the band and landed a few dates on Hopsin's I Am Raw Tour in spring of 2011. KCL would then go on to release an album on Friday the 13th of May, 2011 and spend the next few years playing dives to top concert halls opening for many tours that came to Buffalo. On Halloween Night, 2011 Flatline launched a concept which would then lead to the beginning of Reel Horror Records a label which he would help give some other local 716 acts a platform to gain exposure and release music to a wider spread audience. Summer of 2013 KCL took home an award from the WNY Music Awards for Rap act \"Performance of the Year\". On September 13th, 2013 Flatline resurrected the Spook Show in Downtown Buffalo, NY at the newly opened Waiting Room. The show was a 7 hour jam packed variety show event keeping true to the original Thursday Night Spook Show which he held years earlier at Club Diablo. The show drew hundreds of local fans as they lined up before doors would open and stayed till wee hours of the night to witness this truly amazing event for the local scene. The night also dated the release of the 2nd full length album release from KCL, which was released for free to the public via KampCrystalLake.com Aside from the music, Flatline has written and self published a comic book, directed multiple music videos and short films, acted in movie roles for Troma, and JFR Productions, is a published poet, DJ, Radio Host of The Eulogy on Think Twice Radio, Graphic Designer, and is also a Professional Wrestler, getting his start in 1996 on the underground circuit then training in Toronto, Canada and touring the Northeast in the early to mid 2000's.

Self-taught and trained by the New Jersey bar scene, Tobin owes much of his high-energy performances to his time spent busking on the streets of Galway, Ireland throughout 2015 and 2017. In 2017, Tobin graduated college with a degree in writing. Having expected to become a novelist, his business as a musician began to overshadow his prose. Uncertain of his future, Tobin walked El Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trail through Spain, with his guitar tied to his pack. Upon the trail's completion, the future became obvious. Sean returned to New Jersey in the fall of 2017 where he worked a 9-5 job to fund his music. He released his first album, This Midnight, in 2018. The next year he played Frank Turner's Lost Evenings III in Boston, MA. Later in 2019, Sean released Dreams & Black Caffeine, a four-song EP recorded with his band, The Boardwalk Fire. The group played several shows promoting the EP and planned a tour for 2020, but were forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Instead, Sean and the guys got to work on new music from remote locations. Sean's 2020 LP, East Coast Artifacts, is a compilation of quarantine singles, Dreams & Black Caffeine, and three other tracks.

I was having my first case of writers block around the time Don steeped into my life. \u201cHey kid, how\u2019s the music? Are you writing?!?\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering how it felt to have Don Was checking in on your progress, just know it was life changing. I got back to writing and never stopped! Don was on tour with Bob Weir and Wolf Bros when he mentioned a day off that might be a good time to jump in the studio and track new songs. \u201cJust bring in 9 songs. We\u2019ll play them through and then hit record!\u201d. The idea was to capture the essence of my voice, the story, and my songwriting without adding or subtracting. We recorded live, in the same room. Everything as is. One take. I added harmony and a few pieces of percussion at TRI Studios and The Groove Room with our engineer, Vadim Canby, who also mixed and produced the tracks with an emphasis on keeping the production to the bare minimum. Bringing these songs to life with two of my favorite musicians was an astoundingly beautiful experience and this EP (for me) is just that.

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes. This is part of doing that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "21 year celebration of BTBAM.

The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.\u201d \u2018Forever Just Beyond,\u2019 Barzelay\u2019s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett\u2019s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay\u2019s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery. \u201cI look up to Eef with total respect and admiration,\u201d says Avett, \u201cand I hope to survive like he survives: with total love for the new and the unknown. Eef\u2019s a crooner and an indie darling by sound and a mystic sage by depth. That\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Named for a William S. Borroughs character, Clem Snide first emerged from Boston as a three-piece in the early 1990\u2019s, and the group would go on to become a cult and critical favorite, picking up high profile fans from Bon Iver to Ben Folds over the course of three decades and more than a dozen studio albums. NPR highlighted the Israeli-born Barzelay as \u201cthe most underrated songwriter in the business today, with a sneakily firm grasp on poignancy and humor,\u201d while Rolling Stone hailed his songwriting as \u201csoulful and incisive,\u201d and The New Yorker praised his music\u2019s \u201csoothing melodies and candid wit.\u201d Barzelay currently resides in Nashville, TN.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2000 Lowther Dr, Eatontown, NJ 07724", "Artist": "Joe Grushecky ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7727899.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.3018142, -74.0728798], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Roll, Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Suneagles Golf Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022114672-joe-grushecky-at-suneagles-golf-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Joe Grushecky\u2019s music has stood the test of time.

This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Their new creation, \u201dRecurrence\u201d, is a concept album focusing on the cyclic nature of humanity, while highlighting both the technical- and melodic aspects familliar to the progressive metal genre. With \u201dRecurrence\u201d the band focused on making an album that would be more than just the sum of it\u2019s tracks, and therefore envisioned an album where the songs would float into each other, and at the very end connect with the beginning of the first song, making an \u201dinfinite\u201d album; thus mirroring the lyrics. The major theme of the album, lyrically, more or less presented itself; the cyclic nature of humanity. Within that theme the lyrics explore and challenge topics like dementia, whether the world might be a better place without what humanity has become, and what is left behind when we\u2019re gone. As always the band wanted to challenge themselves technically, always trying do better than the last time. But always keeping the songs and the album as a whole in focus. The result is an album comprising six tracks, varying in length from 5 to 22 minutes per track, at times, but certainly not always; in the tradition of bands like Circus Maximus, Threshold, Arena, Haken, early Dream Theater and Pagan\u2019s Mind. Vicinity started the recording of \u201dRecurrence\u201d in november 2015, at Skarp Studio (Keep of Kalessin, Triosphere, Tellus Requiem), where they tracked the drums. The following months would be spent recording bass, guitars and keyboards at Vicinity\u2019s own recording facilites, once again selfproducing the album. Alexander K. Lykke would then record the vocals at Tagline\u2019s recording facilities in Trondheim. Mixing duties was handed to Christer-Andr\u00e9 Cederberg, who had previously mixed both Circus Maximus and Anathema, aiming for- and ending up with a more organic sounding mix than was the case with \u201dAwakening\u201d. Mastering was once again handled by Jens Bogren (Symphony X, James Labrie, Opeth, Haken, Headspace and many more). Vicinity is the musical melting pot of band members Alexander K. Lykke (vocals), Kim-Marius H. Olsen (guitars), Pierre-Nicolai H. Schmidt-Melbye (bass) and Ivar A. Nyland (keyboards).

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes.

After a successful career contributing to various GRAMMY-nominated albums and performing extensively with beloved groups (including NYC local favorite Jesus On The Mainline and Nees and Vos with Chris Vos of The Record Company), he\u2019s launching his solo career as Andrew Paul, releasing a series of captivating, pared-down tracks that feel both raw and classic at the same time. The new project highlights Andrew\u2019s ability to build emotionally stirring and distinct music with little beyond his voice and his guitar. \u201cWhat I care most about is creating something great. We\u2019re constantly trying to become better versions of ourselves, but that doesn\u2019t mean the skin we\u2019re in is any less perfect or less worthy. One of my goals with this project is to strike a balance between making something perfect and making something real.\u201d Born in Milwaukee, Andrew Paul was raised in a musical family: His father played tuba in a world-famous brass ensemble and his mother was a music teacher. Aware of both the highs and lows of musician life from a young age, Andrew took up the violin at age four, before discovering a deep love for the trumpet at Interlochen Arts Camp one summer. Among the Northern Michigan trees, mentored by some of the most brilliant musicians in the country, he developed an abiding interest in jazz, returning to Interlochen the next eight summers for intense musical study. At the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Andrew earned a degree in Trumpet Performance, touring, performing, writing, and arranging for the school\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated jazz ensemble. \u201cEau Claire is where I really became a musician, playing gigs in the Twin Cities five nights a week. That environment really shaped me as a professional and as an artist.\u201d In the early 2000s, Andrew moved to New York and earned a Jazz Composition degree at the Manhattan School of Music. As Jazz Coordinator for the school after graduation, he formed a tight-knit community with local musicians that led to many future collaborations. For the next decade, Andrew collaborated with a wide spectrum of artists on unique, award-winning projects. He wrote and recorded two albums with drummer David Whitman: Oh, Clara!, which won the 2017 Independent Music Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, and Oh, Hugo! in 2021. He composed, arranged, and toured with the GRAMMY-nominated Bobby Sanabria Multiverse Big Band. He arranged and produced Augie Haas\u2019s Have We Met? and Dream A Little Dream for Playtime Music. And he led NYC-based jam ensemble Jesus On The Mainline, earning a cult following for their \u201cwonderfully raucous, gospel-tinged noise\u201d (according to John Schaefer of WNYC). The group gained popularity until members left to start their own projects. \u201cEventually you realize it\u2019s complicated to take 20 people on the road.\u201d Andrew spent much of 2020\u2019s pandemic honing his guitar skills and developing a new solo creative vision: to write and release a series of stripped-down, rock-and-roll songs as Andrew Paul. \u201cI wanted to be able to perform and tour on my own, and quarantine offered a bittersweet chance to reinvest in myself.\u201d Writing primarily on guitar for the first time, Andrew Paul songs are driven by dynamic melodic lines, vacillating in style between heartland soul, indie rock, and good, old-fashioned rock-and-roll, with a bit of groove (\u00e0 la Budos Band) thrown in the mix. Led by his characteristically natural, earthy vocals, the lyrics tend to cover personal experience: love songs for his partner, stories about his family and friends. The result is a casual but compelling style that feels both idiosyncratic and profound. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. It\u2019s a little jammy, a little loud. It\u2019s very much a portrait of where I am today as a musician and as a human\u2026warts and all. There\u2019s something really powerful about giving in to your passion, regardless of perfection: to celebrate not only the stuff you\u2019re most proud of, but what moves you.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "486 Halsey St, Brooklyn, NY 11233", "Artist": "Adam Levy: Musician ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11519704.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.68338, -73.9346752], "Date": "2021-08-09", "EventDate": "Aug. 9th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz, Electric Blues, Acoustic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rich Hinman vs Adam Levy", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102726971-adam-levy:-musician-at-lunatico?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Whether guitarist Adam Levy\u2019s rich musical career is the result of good fortune or hard work is tough to say. What\u2019s undeniable is that Levy has created a remarkable body of work, and his talents continue to evolve. An imaginative songwriter and composer, Levy\u2019s songs have been recorded by Norah Jones, Glen Phillips (Toad the Wet Sprocket), and others.

Levy is also widely respected as a sideman. He never steps into the solo spotlight without something meaningful to add to a song. His work on Norah Jones\u2019 hit \u201cCome Away with Me\u201d is a shining example. Understated yet memorable, Levy\u2019s solo here draws on jazz and country elements to reflect the song\u2019s earnest sentiment. His bluesy ride on Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cGive Me One Reason\u201d tells a juicy story, with not a single note wasted. He\u2019s also a nuanced accompanist, as can be heard on Allen Toussaint\u2019s recording of \u201cAmerican Tune.\u201d Teaching has long been a vital component of Levy\u2019s musical life.

Coming from a musical household, Isaiah was introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 4, he found an interest in guitar and immediately asked his parents to purchase one. Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams. At the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson. Shortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others. At the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him. In 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project. Since then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others. Currently he is touring as a guitarist for John Mayer's2017The Search For Everything World Tour.

Lange wurde dieses Projekt jedoch auf Grund von ASTAROTH auf Eis gelegt. Erst 2012 fing Nemesis wieder an neue Songs zu schreiben. Im Dezember 2013 enterte er unter der Leitung von Claus Prellinger das CCP Studio. Zusammen arrangierten und produzierten sie das Erstlingswerk \u201eExtinction Level Event\u201c.

At the end of 2013 he entered the studio with its mastemind Claus Prellinger to produce his first longplayer entitled \u201eExtinction Level Event\u201c.

From bars to clubs to theaters to major music festivals, from an early age. Jake became a fixture on the rock music scene. Jake\u2019s band shared the stage with acts such as Blink-182, Jack White, BB King, and The Flaming Lips. In 2010, Rolling Stone described him as \u201chaving the ability to harness the musical ferocity of Trey Anastasio, Les Claypool and Stewart Copeland before being able to legally drive a car\u201d. In 2015, McLovins recorded a self-titled LP with Grammy/Tony/Emmy award winning producer, Bill Sherman, who discovered the band on a trip to Hartford, CT. From there the band toured nationally for several years opening for the likes of the Gin Blossoms, an extended run with Flobots, and playing major festivals like Bunbury in Cincinnati with Foster the People, Chainsmokers and Post Malone as well as Summer Camp in Illinois with Tom Petty, the Roots and Lil\u2019 Dickey. Meanwhile on television, Jake left an imprint as a composer and lyricist for Sesame Street writing dozens of songs for artists like Ed Sheeran and Leon Bridges. He also did a stint leading the house band on ESPN2\u2019s Sports-Nation for a season. In 2019, Jake felt the urge to evolve his sound further and enlisted the help of producing wizard Andy Seltzer (Maggie Rodgers, Chelsea Cutler, many more). The result of three days in Los Angeles with Andy marked the debut release of Jake\u2019s solo project. The sound combines his rock n\u2019 roll roots and acumen as a songwriter with Andy\u2019s golden touch as a next-generation producer. \u201cThe Layover\u201d EP was conceived on a journey to The Fonda Theatre for the Strange 80\u2019s 2 benefit concert. After a 31 hour layover, sleep deprived and delusional Jake landed in LA with only hours to spare until load in. He headed to the venue unaware that this night would forever change his musical journey. Greeted by members of Metallica, Eagles of Death Metal and David Hasselhoff, Jake seamlessly blended into the uniquely chaotic affair. The night escalated into a dream like reality from stage to greenroom, to Jake finding himself on a beach early in the morning with a feeling of deep nostalgia that sunk into his heart. It was then that Jake realized that this was his destiny. This feeling sparked an idea, to create new music that was nostalgic, surreal and of course, music that rocked. With years of touring and production experience under his belt and an ability to masterfully handle multiple instruments, Jake has created a sound that pulls deep from his rock roots and reaches far into what can only be described as the sound of the 20\u2019s. On stage, Jake goes from drums to keys to guitar all while communicating to an audience with deeply personal lyrics and stony vocals. Jake has managed to create a sound with the uniqueness of Arcade Fire, the drive of Tom Petty, and the honesty of Death Cab For Cutie.

Produced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.  Mikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.  Then, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her. Rochester\u2019s artistic community embraced her, encouraged by bandmates including Alex Cot\u00e9 and the group Joywave, she hit her stride. Rochester became Mikaela\u2019s sanctuary.  Delivery benefits from it all. \u201cNow, these songs kind of wonder what I should be doing\u2013\u2013it\u2019s me trying to get myself back to why I started writing in the first place,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cWriting made me feel better and safe when the world around me was falling apart.\u201d  \u201cJust let my songs resonate with you somehow. That would make me so happy.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Emily Wilson ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Outside Patio)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022559652-emily-wilson-at-the-stand-(outside-patio)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "We Hope You Have Fun!"}, {"Address": "173 Morgan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206", "Artist": "Scott H.

Biram. The self proclaimed \u2018Dirty Old One Man Band\u2019 successfully, and sometimes violently, lashes together blues, hillbilly and country precariously to raucous punk and godless metal. Biram ain\u2019t no candy-ass singer/songwriter either, sweetly strumming songs about girls with big eyes and dusty highways. His singing, yodeling, growling, leering and brash preachin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 is accompanied by sloppy riffs and licks from his '59 Gibson guitar and pounding backbeat brought forth by his amplified left foot. The remainder of this one-man band consists of an unwieldy combination of beat-up amplifiers and old microphones strung together by a tangled mess of guitar cables. Years of non-stop touring have honed his assault to a fine edge; his wide-eyed throw downs in the First Church of Ultimate Fanaticism routinely lead giddy followers to a fiery baptism. Scott H. Biram won\u2019t die. On May 11th, 2003, one month after being hit head-on by an 18-wheeler at 75 MPH, he took the stage at The Continental Club in Austin, TX in a wheel chair \u2013 I.V. still dangling from his arm. With 2 broken legs, a broken foot, a broken arm and 1 foot less of his lower intestine, Biram unleashed his trademark musical wrath. When Scott H. Biram took the stage at his 2004 SXSW festival showcase right after Kris Kristofferson he was quoted as growling \u201cThey said that was a hard act to follow\u2026.I\u2019m a hard act to follow motherfuckers!!\u201d The stunned crowd looked on. \u201cScott\u2019s self described \u2018dirty old one-man band\u2019 had a captivating immediacy that big rock shows rarely reach. On stage Scott is a man possessed, spitting and snarling like a Mississippi juke-joint shouter on a moonshine bender.\u201d \u2013 Eben Sterling, Thrasher \u201cHe has a true stage presence that could be fairly compared to that of Clint Eastwood on film. The dude\u2019s more dude than most other dudes you will ever meet.\u201d \u2013 Austin Columnist \u201cAn impassioned multi-instrumentalist unleashing a brutal cacophany with the fury of someone whose check from the Devil finally cleared. Half dirty blues, half underground punk, half honky-tonk, half revival meeting\u2026oh shut up about the math. You\u2019ll see the light.\u201d \u2013 Dayna Papaleo, Rochester City News \u201cHis barbarous exorcism of Depression-era blues\u2014with a bedrock of frantic flatpicking, foot stomps into a floor mike, and gutteral growls through a distortion mike\u2014has made Biram a rising star in Austin.\u201d \u2013 Brian T. Atkinson, No Depression \u201cBiram is the kind of guy you don\u2019t laugh at all the way just in case he really is crazy. We all wanna be entertained, but nobody wants to get stabbed in the head with a screwdriver.\u201d \u2013 Frank de Blase, Rochester City News \u201cWith a raw immediacy that recalls Hasil Adkins and Bob Log III, Biram specializes in a twisted hybrid of gutbucket, hillbilly and godless metal.

Now he is launching a solo project that reimagines Sikh kirtan with boundary-defying Punjabi anthems to uplift & ignite. Sonny's first musical outlet as a child of immigrant parents in North Carolina was singing Sikh devotional music in gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship). His energy shifted to other types of music as he became a more serious musician: ska, reggae, funk, punk rock, bhangra, and more. In 2003, Sonny co-founded the political rock band Outernational and recorded an album produced by Tom Morello. As a singer and trumpet player, he has been central to the sound and raw energy of Red Baraat since the band's inception in 2008, touring globally and recording 5 studio albums. Sonny is currently finishing his debut solo album, produced by Wil-Dog Abers of Ozomatli, entitled Chardi Kala, the Sikh concept of revolutionary eternal optimism. His first single, Mitar Pyare Nu, premiered on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered and Rolling Stone India. Sonny\u2019s music is a reminder that hope, love, and devotion are crucial to our struggles and our collective survival. Chardi Kala is a return to Sonny\u2019s Punjabi & Sikh roots, but with the lens he\u2019s developed over the course of his life as a touring musician, educator, and activist. Musically, the project embodies the many spiritual, political, and aesthetic elements that have shaped Sonny: a bolero-mariachi Sikh shabad on one track, a qawwali song with a reggae bass line on another, a bombastic Ghadar Party tribute in Punjabi and Spanish on yet another. His live band, which includes harmonium, electric guitar, tabla, and drumset, provides listeners with an experience of both introspective reflection and fervent urgency.", "otherInfo": "Sonny Singh's Chardi Kala project LIVE at Rockwood Music Hall Stage 2 in Manhattan. \nDoors - 6pm\nShow - 7pm\n21+ $10 cover\n\nSonny Singh - vocals, trumpet, dhol \nYuka Tadano - bass\nRia Modak - guitar, harmonium, vocals\nJonathan Goldberger - guitar\nRohin Khemani - drums and percussion"}, {"Address": "173 Morgan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Tatters & Rags ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7101142, -73.9336187], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Arrogant Swine", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022200639-tatters-and-rags-at-arrogant-swine?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1200 Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Paperback Writer- The Complete Beatles Experience ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11218768.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.2228108, -73.9991083], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "National Tribute Show", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Paperback Writer LIVE on the Jersey Shore !", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102565758-paperback-writer-the-complete-beatles-experience-at-tim-mcloone's-supper-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Having traveled to 33 countries and over 26 states Paperback Writer -The Beatles Experience can be seen at Disneyland and on board four major cruise lines, theaters and casinos all across the U.S. Hear the hits from the Ed Sullivan Show through the colorful Sgt.

Perhaps most unique to Skout, however, is the intricate, percussive acoustic guitar that has come to define her sound. Skout\u2019s innate knack for catchy, eclectic songwriting shines in her 2014 debut EP, Again Anew. After touring to support the EP and securing talented guitarist Connor Gladney as a songwriting and performing counterpart later that year, Skout caught the attention of soul-pop powerhouse Eric Hutchinson. He signed on to produce her second EP, Just Words, released July 1, 2016. Skout's sophomore effort maintains an unshakeable acoustic backbone while simultaneously demonstrating the versatility of her songwriting chops.

They formed in 2000 in New York, NY. Their name was inspired by an awkward conversation with a U-Haul employee who was inspecting a van that the band had rented. The U-haul employee, attempting to make polite conversation, asked the three bespectacled band members if they were brothers. They said no. He asked if they were scientists. They told him that they were musicians, not scientists. To this day, they regret telling the truth. But the band has denied this and admitted they are in actual fact named after the Cap'n Jazz song which bears the name. The band formed while its members attended the Claremont Colleges. Murray and Cain attended Pomona College; Michael Tapper attended Harvey Mudd College. The band have released three self-made EPs (Bitching!, Safety, Fun, and Learning (In That Order) and In Action) and have released their debut LP, With Love and Squalor on Virgin Records. The first three singles are \"Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt\", \"The Great Escape\" and \"It's a Hit\". The album takes its name from the J.D. Salinger short story \"For Esme - With Love and Squalor\". They have since released another LP Crap Attack, which is a collection of B-Sides, covers and other rarities. The band play the Carling Weekend: Reading and Leeds Festivals in August. In one of their most important television appearances, the band performed on the December 19, 2005 episode of the Late Show with David Letterman on CBS. On the 1st November 2007, NME reported that Michael Tapper has left We Are Scientists under amicable circumstances, and will not join the band for their forthcoming UK University tour. On September 18, 2007, the band announced on their website that Max Hart, a keyboardist and guitarist who has played live with them before, has joined the band temporarily. As they put it: \"There's no easy answer as to how long Max will stick around. Maybe we'll grow to hate his sanctimonious ways, which for now tickle us so. Maybe he'll grow to hate our open-minded, funny, refreshing, handsome ways, thus achieving what psychologists and bookies long ago labeled impossible.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "414 E 14th St, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Amanda Vernon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8847021.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7307794, -73.9820232], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz, R&b, Pop, Pop Soul, Soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Love and Responsibility Young Adult Series", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102637690-amanda-vernon-at-church-of-the-immaculate-conception?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Amanda Vernon is a full-time recording artist and co-author of the new memoir, When God Wrecks Your Romance: Orthodox Faith, Unorthodox Story.

Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"Mohr Stories,\" \"You Made it Weird\" and his own weekly podcast, \"Let There Be Talk,\" on the All Things Comedy network. Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hitmaker for Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys). Dean's comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience. His premises, punchlines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to a near Sam Kinison level of animation. As an actor, Delray can be seen in \"The Longshots\" (starring Ice Cube), \"Hellride\" (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino) and \"Maron\" on IFC.

Coming from a musical household, Isaiah was introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 4, he found an interest in guitar and immediately asked his parents to purchase one. Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams. At the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson. Shortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others. At the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him. In 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project. Since then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others. Currently he is touring as a guitarist for John Mayer's2017The Search For Everything World Tour. Now, Sharkey is poised to finally take center stage as he fuses together his background in gospel, Jazz, R&B, Blues, Rock, and Funk to create an original sound with an unmistakable dose of soul.", "otherInfo": "Seating is First Come, First ServedFull Bar & Full Dinner Menu AvailableNo refunds or exchanges.
