For New Jersey singer/songwriter Tara Dente, that duo of traits is on full display on the new album called Truth In The Mud. Grounded in a kind of rootsy Americana, it\u2019s only after letting each song bloom that one begins to hear all of Dente\u2019s varied influences. From her early years surrounded by the sound of Celtic and church hymns, to her self-guided tour through American vernacular music, you hear solid fingerpicking, storytelling, and a voice that always offers comfort. And from influences as diverse as Nick Drake and Enya, you hear a focus on not just songcraft, but soundcraft - using words and music seamlessly to create a cohesive whole. Since stepping into Asbury Park\u2019s music scene back in 2012, Dente\u2019s reputation has been steadily building, buoyed by her standout 2014 debut called Leave Your Ghosts Behind as well as 2017\u2019s The Gleaner, released worldwide on Travianna Records. With Truth In The Mud, Dente has made her most compelling artistic statement yet. This is the work of an artist in complete command, but still vulnerable to the kind of self-doubt that makes her feel approachable and welcoming. There\u2019s comfort in her songs, because Tara Dente knows what to say - and how to say it - at exactly the right time. Never is that more accurate than on \u2018Hill So Steep,\u2019 the new album\u2019s leadoff track. Despite being written well before 2020\u2019s unprecedented disruption to artistic life, Dente tackles the classic Sisyphean predicament that has become all too familiar for artists living and working in our current environment. As she explains, \u201c\u2019Hill So Steep\u2019 is about a dream I had. In the dream, I was driving up a hill so steep, I felt like I was climbing the steepest roller coaster with no belt on or bar to hold me in and would just fall out. The dream certainly reflected difficult circumstances happening in my life at the time. I was a server at a popular restaurant in my town and did pretty well in tips that day. As soon as I turned the corner walking to my car after work, I noticed it, as well as a slew of other cars, had been towed. The dollar amount it took to get my car back from the auto shop was the exact amount I had made that day in tips. That night, I had the dream. Sometimes you take a step forward, and then take a step right back. But then another day, you'll take three steps forward. You just have to hang in there the best you can and look for the next right thing.\" Truth In The Mud is a giant step forward. And there are many more to come. This is no longer an artist on her way. Tara Dente is already here. It\u2019s time everyone noticed.\u201d -Eric Teel, Jefferson Public Radio", "otherInfo": "Tara Dente & her full band play the iconic, Asbury Park-based Danny Clinch Transparent Gallery, connected to the Asbury Hotel.

They are often credited with bringing rock n' roll back into the mainstream during the late 1980s, resurrecting the styles of bands such as Aerosmith and The Rolling Stones during a time when hair metal and glam rock had been dominating the airwaves. They have released four studio albums, Appetite For Destruction in 1987, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II were both released in 1991, and finally Chinese Democracy was released in 2008. The band was often referred to as \"the world's most dangerous band\" due to their volatile live shows. Stemming from the LA rock & roll underground in 1986, the band signified a shift in rock from slick hair-metal back to gritty, dirty, street-smart rock & roll. The ugly lyrics matched the sleaze of the music--driven by heavy blues licks--covering misogyny, violence, city life, sex, liquor, and hard drugs. They also, however, had a tendency to show sensitivity and a desire to break free from the city. Subsequent albums revealed an influence from bands in the vein of The Rolling Stones and Queen. Their 1987 breakthrough, Appetite for Destruction, (which is the second highest-selling debut album of all-time) 15 times platinum, coupled with the success of the hit single \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" in 1988, took the world by storm. \"Appetite\" was full of raunchy hard rock with blistering anthemic guitar riffs and snarling vocals. It was unlike anything before, it was raw and real with no flaw at all. A follow up EP was made in 1988. \"GNR Lies\" contained 4 songs from their debut EP Live Like A Suicide, 3 new acoustic songs, and an acoustic version of You're Crazy. The album sold well and got into the top 10 alongside Appetite For Destruction. By 1991 they were one of the most popular bands in the world. steven adler (original drummer) was kicked out of the band due to his drug abuse. Matt Sorum replaced Adler. Following the release of GNR Lies, Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 were released. It was a double album that made history by making the number 1 and 2 spots on the American Billboard Album chart. The album was filled with songs that pushed Guns into a different direction. It was far away from the Appetite era and contained more \"epic\" tracks featuring a wider range of instruments (pianos, brass instruments, various effects, etc). The Use Your Illusion albums surprised critics, who expected a double album loaded with hard rock songs, but found more piano-driven tracks. The main response was that instead of releasing two albums that included \"filler tracks\", they could have released one CD. After the release of the albums, the band started a world tour to support the albums. During this tour, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin quit the band due to a combination of being upset with Rose's management of the band and differences between Slash, Sorum, and McKagan due to his newfound sobriety. The historic tour ended in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 17, 1993. The tour set attendance records and lasted for 28 months, in which 192 shows were played. The show in Buenos Aires marked the last time original members Slash and McKagan as well as newcomers Clarke and Sorum would play a live show with Rose. Axl Rose began work on a new album of original material in 1993, but none of the material has ever been released.[24] In 1994, Gilby Clarke left the band, and was replaced with Paul Tobias. That same year, the band recorded a cover version of The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" for the movie Interview with the Vampire. According to Slash's autobiography published in 2007, the first version of guitar track was rejected by Axl - he wanted Slash to copy Keith Richard's playing on the original while Slash wanted to create a 'Guns N' Roses version' of the song rather than copy Keith's style. Reluctantly Slash agreed and recorded another version closer to the original. Slash was further infuriated when he discovered Tobias' guitar copying his own solo note by note layered in the final mix of the song. This would be the last recording by the original version of the band, and five years would go by before any new material came out under the Guns N' Roses name. Slash then drifted in and out of the band for the next couple of years, beginning a side project called Slash's Snakepit. In August 1996, the band returned to the studio, even though McKagan and Sorum were simultaneously touring with their side project Neurotic Outsiders. Eventually, only Slash and Rose were left alone to continue working. During this period, Slash commented in an interview, \"My relationship with Axl right now is sort of at a stand still.\" Additionally, during this period, Axl had approached guitarist Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society) about jamming with the band and possibly joining Guns N' Roses. In 1996 and 1997 Slash, Sorum and McKagan all left the band for good, leaving Rose as the only remaining charter member of the band. Slash, McKagan and Sorum later formed rock supergroup Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and guitarist Dave Kushner. In 1998, a \"clean\" (i.e. profanity removed) version of Use Your Illusion was released (in the USA only), mainly so the album could be sold in Wal-Mart and K-Mart stores. Also in 1998, Axl put a new version of the band together and returned to the studio. This version of the band has been touring and recording sporadically ever since. The new band's membership has changed frequently, but its core members have included guitarist Robin Finck, effects man Chris Pitman, and bassist Tommy Stinson (formerly of The Replacements)\u2014 as well as Paul Tobias, drummer Josh Freese and longtime Guns N' Roses keyboardist Dizzy Reed. In 1999, the band released one new song, \"Oh My God\", which was included on the soundtrack of the film End of Days. The track featured additional guitar work by Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine, Rose's personal guitar teacher. The song's release was intended to be a prelude to their new album, now officially entitled Chinese Democracy. Geffen also released Live Era: '87-'93, a collection of live performances from various concerts during the Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion tours. Also in 1999, during an interview with Kurt Loder for MTV, Axl said that he had re-recorded Appetite for Destruction with the then-new band, apart from two songs which he had replaced with \"Patience\" and \"You Could Be Mine\". In 1999, guitarist Robin Finck departed the band in order to rejoin his former band, Nine Inch Nails, on tour. In 2000, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead joined Guns N' Roses as a replacement for Finck. Josh Freese was replaced with Bryan Mantia (formerly of Primus). Robin Finck returned to Guns N' Roses in late 2000, to complement Buckethead on lead guitar. The revised lineup finally made a public appearance in January 2001, with two well-received concerts, one in Las Vegas and one at the Rock in Rio Festival in Rio de Janeiro. The band played a mixture of old hits as well as new songs from their forthcoming album. The new lineup played a further two shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2001. In 2002, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band because of his frustrations with life on the road. He was replaced by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). The band then played several shows in August 2002, headlining festivals and concerts throughout Asia and Europe. They made their way to New York for a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. In 2002, the band's first North American tour since 1993 was organized to support Chinese Democracy. However, the opening show in Vancouver was cancelled by the venue when Rose failed to turn up (having remained in Los Angeles), and a riot ensued. This tour was met with mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia, tour promoter Clear Channel cancelled the remainder of the tour. The band went on hiatus until they were scheduled to play at Rock in Rio IV in May 2004. However, Buckethead left the band in March of that year, causing the band to cancel. Also in March 2004, Geffen released Guns N' Roses' Greatest Hits, since Rose had failed to deliver a new studio album in more than ten years. Rose expressed his displeasure with this album as its track listing was established without his consent and went as far as trying to block its release by suing Geffen. This failed, however, and the album went triple platinum in the USA. In February 2006, demos of the songs \"Better\", \"Catcher in the Rye\", \"I.R.S.\", and \"There Was a Time\" were leaked on the internet through a Guns N' Roses fan site. The band's management requested that all links to the MP3 files and all lyrics to the songs be removed from forums and websites. Despite this, radio stations began adding \"I.R.S.\" to playlists, and the song actually reached #49 on the Radio & Records Active Rock National Airplay chart in the final week of February - the first time an internet leak has done so. On May 5, 2006, Axl Rose appeared on the Friday Night Rocks with Eddie Trunk radio show (during an interview with Sebastian Bach) and said that the new Guns N' Roses album would be released before the end of the year. Later in May, the band launched a European tour, headlining both the Download Festival and Rock In Rio - Lisbon. Four warm-up shows preceded the tour at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and became the band's first live concert dates since the aborted 2002 tour. The shows also marked the debut of virtuoso guitarist and composer Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, replacing Buckethead. During the tour, former bandmate Izzy Stradlin and ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach made frequent guest appearances. As of 2008, Guns N Roses are: Thomas Eugene Stinson (Bass) Robin Finck (Lead Guitar) Richard Fortus (Rhythm Guitar) Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal (Virtuoso Guitar) W. Axl Rose (Lead Vocals) Chris Pitman (Synth) Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia (Drums) Frank Ferrer (Drums, touring replacement) and Darren \"Dizzy\" Reed (Keyboard and Congas). The band toured extensively in 2006/07, playing to over 750 000 people in over 23 countries. Chinese Democracy had been given the tentative release date of March 6th, then reported September 17, 2007. However both dates passed with no sign of the album. Further release dates of February 11, 2008 and February 12, 2008 were set by HMV and Amazon, and now stand at August 25th, 2008. Acording to the official website the band is \"in negotiations for the release of Chinese Democracy\", as of the 20th of April 2008. Many of the other members of Guns N' Roses (Slash, Duff McKagan & Matt Sorum) now play together in the hard-rock band Velvet Revolver with Dave Kushner and until March 2008, ex-Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland. However, Izzy Stradlin, original GN'R rhythm guitarist and co-composer of many of the band's most successful songs, has not joined them. He did however play a few dates with the new line-up of Guns N' Roses in the summer of 2006, as a guest. Keyboard player Dizzy Reed, while not a founding member of the band (joining in 1990 in the Use Your Illusion period), remains with Guns N' Roses in their current incarnation. On November 24, 2008, Chinese Democracy was released.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

During this time, JW Farrell began to develop his sound as a solo singer-songwriter. While hibernating in Alexandria, Virginia, he wrote and recorded his debut EP. Taking notes from some of his songwriting heroes, Jack White, Bruce Springsteen and John McCauley as well as the sonic influence of some of his favorite bands, The Walkmen, My Morning Jacket and The Raconteurs, Farrell has created a captivating blend of americana, new wave and rock. \u201cFrancisville\u201d and \u201cAlexandria EP\u201d are available on ITunes, Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music", "otherInfo": "Kevin Barry Lynch and his Hindrance's , Reckoner (Radiohead Cover), 50 Ft.

Equipped with a Telecaster, a Gibson Hummingbird and 17 dollars, he is coming to your town to play his guts out and then stand by the merch table. \"Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements\" was produced by Brian and released in May of 2017 independently.

The first two singles were picked up by SiriusXM radio, and if you visited a shopping mall during the spring of 2017, you probably heard the lead single \"Don't Give Up On Me\" being interrupted by an announcement that someone had lost their kid at the food court. Brian followed the release of \"Bug Fixes\" with a live EP of stripped-down versions of previously released songs entitled \u201cThe Timber House Sessions\u201d.

Precocious from the very start, Xenia began composing her own songs and poems at the age of 7, and by 15 had taught her-self how to play the guitar, piano, harmonica, and ukulele. Xenia played the instruments off and on throughout elementary and middle school, but it wasn\u2019t until she heard Jon McLaughlin\u2019s \u201cIndiana\u201d that she decided to try singing. While listening to the likes of Billy Joel and Johnny Cash, she\u2019d sing around the house quietly and despite her mother\u2019s urging, the soft-spoken girl tried to initially hide her gift. While in her first year of high school, Xenia reluctantly entered a local singing contest and won. \u201cI\u2019d listen to music and dream about it,\u201d she reveals. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I wanted to pursue it as a career until that contest. I always tried to keep it a secret.\u201d The secret was out, and she began to chase that dream actively. She found out about The Voice auditions in Los Angeles on Twitter, merely two weeks after starting an account. Her parents brought her to the audition, and she nailed it. The NBC show became a massive hit, garnering incredible ratings and soon adding a second season. For Xenia, it was a monumental event. She cultivated a fervent fan base and grew immensely in the process as a result of being on the show. \u201cIt really changed my life,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cEverything was different, and I learned so much about myself, music, and what I wanted to do with my life.\u201d Music has always been an important part of Xenia\u2019s life and, as a result, delivers honest and soulful pop songs with palpable vitality. That energy landed her in the Top 8 on NBC\u2019s hit television show, The Voice, as the youngest finalist. Previously signed to Universal Republic Records, Xenia released her debut EP Sing You Home on December 20, 2011. It peaked at #2 on the iTunes Pop charts, and #10 on the iTunes overall charts. The music video for her EP\u2019s lead single, \u201cSing You Home\u201d, along with her robust, raspy voice gained the attention of celebrities like Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lopez and Avril Lavigne, who shared her music video on their YouTube channels. \u201cSing You Home\u201d has now gained over 700,000 views on YouTube. She has since continued to write, record, and collaborate with other artists. In 2012 she sang a duet on singer-songwriter Jon McLaughlin\u2019s album, Forever If Ever, called \u201cMaybe It\u2019s Over\u201d. Xenia was also featured on Blake Shelton\u2019s first Christmas album, Cheers, It\u2019s Christmas, providing guest vocals for the song \u201cSilver Bells\u201c. Now we await the release of her forthcoming EP, Artemisa, which is titled after her grandmother.

Frontman Ryan Young thinks so, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s the first record I\u2019ve ever made that I like,\u201d laughs Young. \u201cBecause there was no reason to make it anything other than what I wanted it to be.\u201d The band has been relatively quiet over the last few years, largely because Young was tending to an ill family member who ultimately passed away last year. But through mourning came inspiration. \u201cShe was a photographer, and at the wake were all these photos she took,\u201d he remembers. One of those photos struck him immediately. It shows a Mennonite family enjoying a sunny day at the beach while an ominous cooling tower looms in the background. \u201cI said: That\u2019s gonna be the cover of the album that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d That photo captures the spirit of Be Good. While all of Off With Their Heads\u2019 previous work shares a common thread of being rooted in Young\u2019s fatalistic view of the world, Be Good at least allows a tiny glimmer of hope to peek through. \u201cAll the other records were about moping around and feeling sorry for yourself,\u201d says Young. \u201cThis one is less about feeling sorry for yourself and more about accepting how goddamn miserable you are.\u201d Forced acceptance is big theme of Be Good, though it\u2019s a hard-learned one, often emerging in the form of primal screams in the band\u2019s trademark style of gruff-punk. \u201cHands up to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs, til the floor falls out!\u201d Young yells on the title track, sounding somewhere between motivational speaker and hard-nosed therapist. Much of the self-deprecation that defined the band\u2019s previous work has been adjusted. It was the years spent out of the van, developing a life at home in Chicago, that gave Young his newfound, slightly more positive perspective. \u201cNot being on the road 250 days a year, actually trying to develop some sort of life outside of playing shows and drinking, you\u2019d be surprised what that does,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a bunch of weight, I\u2019ve been going to a gym every day, trying not to kill myself all the time.\u201d Young and the band members\u2014bassist Robbie Smartwood, guitarist John Polydoros, and new drummer Kyle Manning\u2014holed up for two and a half weeks at Pachyderm Studios, a mid-century mansion in Minnesota where Nirvana recorded In Utero, to make Be Good. Young produced the record himself, and it was the first time he enjoyed the process, or at least tolerated it. \u201cI don\u2019t like how the old records sound, and I hate recording so much,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could just hear all the dumb shit on them where I was like, whatever, just let it go, I want to get out of here.\u201d Be Good will be released by Epitaph Records on August 16 and, if ever there was a time for Ryan Young\u2019s distinct brand on cautious optimism, it\u2019s now. \u201cThe title is an answer to that question of what you\u2019re supposed to do now that the world is so awful and the climate of this stupid country is so shitty,\u201d he says. \u201cBe good, be loud\u2014that\u2019s sometimes all you can do, I guess, as cheesy as that sounds.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 & Garden State Pkwy, Holmdel, NJ 07733", "Artist": "Zac Brown Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11266492.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.3044719, -72.9262301], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "PNC Bank Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "Three-time GRAMMY-winning multi-platinum artists Zac Brown Band have had five consecutive albums reach the top 10 of the Billboard 200 and four consecutive albums debut at #1 on Billboard\u2019s Country Albums chart.

Sounds pretty scary -- but for Chris Pinnella it's the stuff of natural habitat; an environment that the versatile vocalist has thrived in, whether performing with symphony orchestras around the country, leading his own combos of anywhere from 8 to 15 players, or (for several tours of North America and Europe) lending his finely honed skills to the prog-rock / crossover locomotive known as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. That association with the late Paul O'Neil's spectacularly scaled project netted the New Jersey native a platinum record for his contributions to 'The Lost Christmas Eve' tour, and a chance to perform for an audience of over 1 million people, during a particularly raucous New Year's Eve in Berlin. In the process the seasoned young performer - a singer whose influences run from the epic arias of Pavarotti, to the elegant jazz phrasings of Tony Bennett and the next generation concert hall mastery of Bocelli and Groban - built his brand as a bandleader through gigs at venues that range from big city nightspots to theatres across the United States such as The Algonquin Arts Theatre in New Jersey as well as Axelrod PAC, The Great Auditorium, The Pollack Theatre, Rahway PAC, The Newton Theatre, House of Independents, The Grunin Center for the Arts, McLoone's Supper Club and numerous Luxury Private, Charity, Fundraising Galas and Events throughout the country. He has also played such prestigious NYC venues as Birdland, The Rainbow Room, The Explorers Club, The Rose Theatre at Jazz! At Lincoln Center, The Cutting Room, and Feinstein's / 54 Below. Recently, Pinnella was tapped by American Young Voices, singing with the group as one of their guests vocalists alongside massive student choirs ranging from 3000-8000 young singers touring major arenas, including a sold out evening at The Prudential Center in Newark, NJ. Pinnella began his career professionally at the age of 16 after an audition for Maestro Fr. Alphonse Stephenson & the Orchestra of St. Peter performing with the orchestra on and off throughout his career. Chris went on to pursue music and received his degree from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. Post college he worked off-Broadway and regional theatre and had the opportunity to portray the title role of Simeon in the New Musical 'Simeon's Gift' which was co-written by icon Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton-Hamilton. Pinnella spent a month with Ms. Andrews and the 6-person cast at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, NY working side by side until the shows premiere. Pinnella also worked alongside Emmy, Oscar winning arranger Ian Fraser and the Tony nominated John Bucchino and Tony nominated director Marcia Milgrom Dodge (B'Way's Ragtime) on the project. Currently Chris is working on writing and arranging his debut EP which is set to drop in 2020. The 11-track debut will feature mostly original material as well as a re-worked covers, namely Pinnella's always requested version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' will be given an overhaul complete with gospel choir and full orchestra. Infusing elements of jazz, classical, alternative, rock, and pop, Pinnella has his sights set on making 2020 his best year yet. \"Pinnella has been compared to vocal superstars Josh Groban and Michael Buble, but there is no doubt about the fact that Pinnella has a style that is completely his own.

Fronted by bad girl tease Labretta Suede, with her sexy gritty performances, full frontal outfits and irresistible, irreverent, deep rich vocals that simply undress and unleash you. while, right-hand flesh eating Johnny Moondog makes you completely unhinged with his wild tone, crazed reverb and mind bending psychedelic distortion and sneer. These two unruly and insatiable founding members are the essence behind this world traveled jungle of juju strange. Complimented by their original New Zealand counterparts, Chris 'Bumbo' Kemp (drums) and JayL Vodanovich (bass) who kept their heads cool to lay down the slosh, so as not to drown. This melding of nostalgic, yet originally infused swagger was at the fore front of badass rock n roll car culture, b -grade art, cinema and burlesque in their faraway shores of Aotearoa (New Zealand). However, feeling the fever to spread the disease long and far from the way down under pools of volcanic laha, hey relocated to the other side of the planet. That's right, to New York City, a place where only the sick and depraved can truly survive. Surviving on bare bones alone on their continuing journey of rock n roll debris, struggling in a big city filled with millions seeking to find just the right kinda strange to fit their new line-up.

I was taken to one of your shows recently by my niece Ana. Now I must admit, I\u2019m not well-versed in the amorphous, genre-defying spirit of the time (which you so casually seem to channel). But I\u2019m home now in my cabin in the Catskills and I felt compelled to write you this note urging you to show yourself. Were you busy? Shy? Have you been dead for a while? The boys on stage seem to hold you in their midst like a seance, indeed I spoke to all of them individually and, like your totems they are all well-chosen, each a figure of the ceaseless joy that pervades from your opening till the end of the party after the party you invited us back to. They glide through the human verve of a barn dance, the esoteric channeling of electronic sounds I am, alas, so unfamiliar with (though Ana tells me your instincts are so correct as to already have stretched way beyond the pale of what the uninformed would call \u2018Ee Dee Em\u2019). At times they sing together like sacred harps, evoking some ritual (I saw their fans at the front, eyes half-lidded, trancing, mouthing every word, even when they push those words through their strange machines). Other times they break into some elevated heartbeat of the future, like a gang, syncing up in the darkness of the stage but always in the light of the mind. The experience is rapturous. Ah, I\u2019ve digressed. You know, I\u2019m not even sure that Psymon Spine exists; is it a code, an orginazation? PSY for psychedelic, MON for the harmonious way you hold each other musically through even the weirder turnings of your set, the snaking through modern and ancient, folk, doom, trance music. The SPINE must then be all of you together, and me perhaps - as a newcomer, that current below which mysteriously unites everything. If Psymon Spine does exist, please wish him well on the other side, or in whichever dimension he now dwells. Please continue, my friends, for the sake of all those I saw leaving your show drenched in sweat, smiling, the young and the old alike whom I saw forget themselves among your sonic fray. Excuse this scribble; I am sending it without permission of my niece, who insists the mystery is part of why we come. Tell Psymon thank you, tell him he's left his ghost in very capable hands.

The New York City band sounds like someone spinning a radio dial with such passionate intensity that all the stations blend together into a single, transcendent, almost spiritual force. It\u2019s disco to the beat of modern house; it\u2019s a Supremes cover of a Cardi B banger; it\u2019s Roland Kirk playing jazz through one saxophone, funk through another, and the most earwormy pop tune the 1970\u2019s could muster through a third. It\u2019s an experience\u2014one so effecting that with only a self-released 12\u201d single in circulation, 79.5 had been written up twice in The New Yorker on the merit of their live sets alone. Still, all this mixing and matching, this manic twirling of an FM dial, might seem like a bit of a mess: a recipe for ungrounded noodling and static. And perhaps it would be, were these disparate influences not anchored so solidly by the delicate crunch of singer and narcissist keyboardist Kate Mattison\u2019s Fender Rhodes. The Rhodes is the throbbing heart of 79.5, the melodic grit that gives its pristine vocals their edge. And like Mattison, it is the touchstone around which the band was built. Though the genesis of 79.5 was defined more by an organic growth than a singular event, the band could begin its origin story in 2012, the year Mattison renamed her band after an imaginary radio station, one that acted as a mercurial melting pot for genres as varied as house, soul, disco, jazz and new jack swing, all seasoned with an AM Gold crackle. Whenever, wherever 79.5 began, the band that has since coalesced around Mattison\u2019s Rhodes is comprised of individuals who have an inextricable connection between music and their paths through life. \u201cBoy Don\u2019t Be Afraid,\u201d the first single off of Predictions, showcases the sleek musicianship and palpable joy that course through entire record. Produced by Big Crown Records co-founder Leon Michels, Predictions is a timeless journey through a New York City dreamscape\u2014where spring never ends, the clubs never close, and new love is always right around the corner of the next city block. Mysterious, classy, and underscored with a simmering passion, the record captures the infectious mood of 79.5\u2019s live sets, transporting listeners directly to the front of the stage. There\u2019s a reason radio stations as eclectic as 79.5 don\u2019t exist. People tend to gravitate towards a specific type of music in a given moment, one that syncs up with their emotional state or that satiates their particular taste. But somehow the blend of influences 79.5 has synthesized hits a sweet spot that feels at home in nearly any moment, any setting. Disc Jockeys across all wavelengths love to remind their listeners not to \u201cflip that dial,\u201d but tuned into 79.5, it\u2019s unlikely anyone would ever want to.", "otherInfo": "LIVE IN THE SULTAN ROOM"}, {"Address": "158 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "The Living Strange ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9253597.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.72097249999999, -73.9876401], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Pianos", "moreBioInfo": "The Living Strange is a Brooklyn based Alternative Rock band that is best summarized as the kind of band that ends up on the floor, with bright colors, and hearing loss.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "56-15 Northern Boulevard, Queens, NY 11377", "Artist": "Juan Fernando Velasco ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/146007.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7538318, -73.90442949999999], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "La Boom", "moreBioInfo": "Juan Fernando Velasco naci\u00f3 en Quito, Ecuador.

De hecho, hizo cuatro semestres en Econom\u00eda, pero la cosa definitivamente no iba por ah\u00ed. La m\u00fasica ya lo hab\u00eda atenazado desde que un compa\u00f1ero del colegio le propuso ser parte de la banda de rock que ten\u00eda junto con sus hermanos. La banda se llamaba Tercer Mundo. Ese fue el comienzo. Diez a\u00f1os de giras enloquecidas, fan\u00e1ticas adolescentes al borde de la histeria, camisas ra\u00eddas y mil historias compartidas en el camino, fueron suficientes y le llevaron a decidir buscar su propio camino, solo.

Clasific\u00f3 al Cuadrag\u00e9simo Festival de Vi\u00f1a del Mar (1999) precisamente con la canci\u00f3n que le dio nombre a este \u00e1lbum y que tuvo gran acogida en su pa\u00eds, logrando Disco de Oro por ventas y situ\u00e1ndose en los primeros lugares de popularidad. Cuando empezaba a pensar en su siguiente trabajo, Para que no me olvides se filtr\u00f3 en Colombia y se volvi\u00f3 un \u00e9xito, logrando esta vez Disco de Platino y renombre internacional. A partir de all\u00ed se iniciar\u00eda una fuerte relaci\u00f3n del cantautor con Colombia. En el 2002 public\u00f3 su segundo \u00e1lbum, Tanto Amor , que muestra a Juan Fernando Velasco como un m\u00fasico y productor creativo, capaz de imprimir matices y propuestas musicales innovadoras en cada canci\u00f3n. Chao Lola , Dicen , Hoy que no est\u00e1s , Si alguna vez te am\u00e9 y Salud se ubican en los primeros lugares en las listas de popularidad en los pa\u00edses en los que se hab\u00eda publicado este segundo \u00e1lbum (Ecuador, Colombia, Panam\u00e1, Guatemala y Costa Rica), logrando nuevamente Disco de Platino en Colombia y en Ecuador. Aqu\u00ed se inicia una extensa gira de conciertos masivos con localidades agotadas en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, confirmando que Velasco no s\u00f3lo vende, sino que es capaz de atrapar a audiencias muy diversas que encuentran en \u00e9l y en su m\u00fasica una propuesta novedosa, seria y genuina. En el 2006 Juan Fernando realiz\u00f3 varias presentaciones importantes, entre ellas, la realizada junto a Franco de Vita en el Madison Square Garden de la ciudad de Nueva York en Febrero pasado. Adem\u00e1s de estos logros profesionales, su lado humano y su compromiso social son reconocidos con diferentes condecoraciones y nombramientos. Entre ellos, los dos m\u00e1s importantes: la Orden Vicente Rocafuerte (2004), m\u00e1ximo reconocimiento que entrega el Congreso del Ecuador al M\u00e9rito Art\u00edstico, y la designaci\u00f3n como Embajador de la Paz y la Ternura (2004) por parte de la Plataforma Interamericana de Derechos Humanos.

She is not a song writer, nor is she a \"cover\" artist. She is an interpreter of the highest order. Her gift is being able to take a song, whether well known or obscure, from any genre and making it completely her own. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Willie Nelson, and Bruce Springsteen are just a few of the artists who have had their work re-imagined by Bettye. Now, in her 55th year in show business, she has been signed to Verve Records, and has recorded an album of all Bob Dylan songs. Things Have Changed is a masterpiece of interpretation of the songs of one of the greatest songwriters alive, by one of the greatest soul singers alive. Bettye has recorded Dylan songs in the past, but this is the first time that she has devoted an entire album to one writer. She will be performing the album in it's entirety, along with other songs from throughout her career. Her career began in 1962, at the age of 16, in Detroit, Michigan. Her first single \"My Man - He\u2019s a Loving Man\", was released on Atlantic Records. She recorded for numerous major labels, including Atco, Epic, and Motown, over the course of the 1960s through the 1980s. The 2000's started what she calls her \"Fifth Career\". Her CD, A Woman Like Me, won the W.C. Handy Award in 2004 for Comeback Blues Album of the Year. She was also given a prestigous Pioneer Award by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation. She has received Blues Music Awards for Best Contemporary Female Blues Singer and Best Soul Blues Female Artist. She recorded 4 CDs for hipster indie label ANTI- Records over the course of 8 years, 2 of which received Grammy nominations. Her 2015 CD, Worthy, was also nominated for a Grammy. Although still not a household name, fans, critics and artists have nothing but high praise for her live show and her interpretive vocal skill.

Such is the theme of Curtis\u2019 latest release, ONE LAST STAND, a high-energy concept album that takes you across the great divide: a journey from adolescence to adulthood. Curtis released the album in 2015 just before hitting the road again for a North American tour. The album featured a recording of \u201cBootleg Gasoline\u201d which was also made into a music video in 2016.

The album\u2019s soaring debut single, \u201cjoy,\u201d which features a 100-person choir and a hypnotic wave of rhythm and electronic sounds, hit No. 1 and has been streamed more than 12 million times. The lyrics cut through the cacophony of societal noise to remind us about what is important: \u201cOh, hear my prayer tonight. \u2018Cause this is do or die. The time has come to make a choice. I choose joy.\u201d The inspiring pop masterpiece also represents the exciting adventure into unchartered territory for brothers Joel and Luke Smallbone, who were propelled into superstardom with the release of their critically acclaimed sophomore album, RUN WILD. LIVE FREE. LOVE STRONG., which debuted at No. 1 on iTunes and was certified gold. In addition to winning two GRAMMYs and four Dove Awards, the duo performed internationally on a hugely successful 60-date arena tour. They have garnered four No. 1s (\u201cjoy,\u201d \u201cPriceless,\u201d \u201cFix My Eyes,\u201d and \u201cShoulders\u201d), nine Top 10 hits, and had songs featured on the Emmys, Super Bowl, Sunday Night Football and many other high-profile events, including performances on The Tonight Show, Today and Jimmy Kimmel Live! But as they reveal in Burn the Ships, there is no looking back, no resting on their laurels. There is much more to explore and explain, especially during this time of great unrest when answers don\u2019t seem immediately apparent. With a new level of vulnerability and honesty, they wrote every song on this project, which they also co-produced with longtime collaborators Aqualung, Tedd T. and Seth Mosely. \u201cIt isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 far from it \u2013 but there is a sense of truthfulness and a heart and a personality and an ideology behind this record,\u201d Joel says. \u201cIt feels like the most mature version of for KING & COUNTRY.\u201d The title track was inspired by a 1500s Spanish explorer who boldly landed his ships on enemy shores without any knowledge of what awaited his arrival. To ensure that the men were committed to their mission, he proclaimed, \u201cBurn the ships!\u201d The only way to go was onward; retreat was not an option. \u201cThat is the big statement that this collection of songs is making,\u201d says Luke. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live in the past; we want to move forward. There are things in everybody\u2019s pasts that you have to get rid of\u2014in some cases physically burn and in other cases you just need to get rid of them however you can emotionally. For us, that is the name that represents this collection of art and work best.\u201d These songs fit in perfectly with today\u2019s pop music arena, where artists ranging from Kesha to Drake are exploring themes of religion, prayer and God. The Smallbones\u2019 words are a soothing salve for a hurting nation in need of healing. \u201cPeople are hungry for truth and hope,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they want something that is false. So when it comes to people seeking out God, they are receptive because they are trying to figure out what is true and real. I think that is a good thing. I hope our music can play a role in that, but ultimately people have to figure it out for themselves.\u201d Burn the Ships may be the duo\u2019s most personal work to date because the songs are about some of the most meaningful and terrifying moments of their lives. For instance, \u201cNeed You More\u201d was inspired by the near-death of Luke\u2019s infant son, Leo. His wife Courtney found Leo in his crib, blue from not breathing. She began CPR while praying over their son, who soon came back to life. While driving to the hospital, the words, \u201cI need you more/more than ever before,\u201d came to Luke, who hit record on his phone. That original recording, including sounds from the car, was included in the final mix. \u201cMy hope is that if I have gone through some form of suffering, maybe there is someone else who has gone through something similar who can take a bit of hope that there was someone else just like them,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI feel like God has given me these struggles to share those stories.\u201d \u201cjoy.\u201d was inspired by Luke\u2019s late-night marathon scrolling through social media. \u201cI couldn\u2019t articulate in that moment why I was sad, but it sent me on a pilgrimage, and that is where \u2018joy\u2019 came from.\u201d I realized I needed to do something if I want to have joy. I can\u2019t just scroll and find it.\u201d While \u201cFight On, Fighter\u201d continues the duo\u2019s focus on a woman\u2019s worth, it is first and foremost a musical letter of support to their wives. Joel and Luke, who have become American citizens, learned about hope, love and support from their tight-knit family. Their parents raised seven children in Sydney, Australia, before moving to Nashville in 1991. Music became the family business. Their charismatic father was a music promoter and sister Rebecca St. James became a successful Christian music artist, so the duo\u2019s teen years were spent working as part of her road crew. When Luke was 19 and Joel was 21, they formed a band and began writing and recording the body of work that would become for KING & COUNTRY. They released their debut album, Crave, in 2012 and won New Artist of the Year at the 2013 Dove Awards, where they received six nominations. In what has become a full-circle moment, they wrote \u201cNever Give Up\u201d with sister Rebecca for the new album. Once novices, they are now their sister\u2019s peers and have a shared understanding of the difficulties of being frequently away from home. \u201cWe learned the craft of music and fell in love with it on the road with Rebecca, \u201c Joel says. \u201cIn some ways, for KING & COUNTRY is a legacy band of Rebecca\u2019s. It\u2019s a real special moment to be able to have that creative collaboration after all of these years with her.\u201d The album\u2019s theme of adventure and exploration ends poetically with \u201cPioneers,\u201d a lush song about the romance and realities of long-term commitment. Fittingly, wives Moriah and Courtney join them on the final track. \u201cIn a time where commitment can be hard to come by\u2014the through-thick-and-thin/death-do-us-part kind of commitment\u2014it\u2019s a song that celebrates that kind of love,\u201d Joel says. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that the duo felt compelled to embark on this musical pilgrimage because they have been two of our most prescient storytellers in recent years, addressing issues even before they became part of the national conversation. It\u2019s as if they know what we need to hear exactly when we need to hear it. For instance, their 2016 No. 1 hit \u201cPriceless\u201d, which also inspired the Smallbones\u2019 human-trafficking themed movie by the same name, celebrates a woman\u2019s worth. Several years before the #MeToo phenomenon, the Smallbones sparked a movement highlighting a woman\u2019s value that continues to grow and evolve today. They began writing and recording songs about hope and love several years ago for Burn The Ships, messages that are vital during these tumultuous times. Their music provides answers, comfort and affirmation, while offering a constant reminder that we aren\u2019t alone, even in our darkest times. \u201cWe never want to be a voice of critique or criticism, but a voice of, \u2018Maybe if we shifted our perspective, what would we see?\u2019 That is the beauty of music,\u201d Joel says. \u201cWe ask the questions of ourselves: \u2018I want to have joy. I want to find a way. When I am faced with despair, struggle or hardship, what can I do?\u2019\u201d Luke adds, \u201d The thing I am most proud of with this album is that when I look at all 10 songs, they all have a special place in my heart and there is a real significant story with each one. This album is about those songs in our hearts being exposed to others, and hopefully others will expose their hearts too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "8-08 Queens Plaza South Entrance on, Queens County, NY 11101", "Artist": "Rick Wonder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11559903.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7537922, -73.9494577], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Open Format Club And Radio Dj, Edm, House, Tech House, Open Format, Bass House", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Profundo Day Club", "moreBioInfo": "", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "260 Meserole St, Brooklyn, NY 11206", "Artist": "Carry ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.708425, -73.93818920000001], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "3 Dollar Bill", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SUMMER SKOOL with SAUCY SANTANA"}, {"Address": "110-00 Rockaway Blvd, Jamaica, NY 11420", "Artist": "Crash The Party Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11591549.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6727098, -73.83279569999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop, 80s, Rock, Top 40 Hits, Music From 2000-2009- Duh., Edm", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Crash The Party Live at Resorts World Casino NYC", "moreBioInfo": "In early 2018, 24 year old Carlos Gabriel (Lead Singer) approached 107 Productions, asking what needed to be done to put together the next \"big band\". and their reply was simple; Assemble a band of young, energetic, talented, and reliable musicians.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

In 2018 the duo found their musical counterpart in bass player Bill Crook and partnered with Pale Chord Music to continue to create and release music in single and EP formats. Spiritbox have quickly become hotly tipped as one of the most exciting, creative and unique new forces to erupt from the world of heavy music. Pushing boundaries both sonically and visually with their beautifully haunting music videos that perfectly mach the complex, heavy instrumentation combined with the juxtaposition of the ethereal, velvet textures of Courtney's singing voice and the visceral, rageful power of her screams. Drawing their name from a device that some believe is capable of communing with the dead, the band have a paranormal undertone that runs through everything they do, using EVP (electronic voice phenomena) recordings both at their live shows and within their tracks. A quick look at music videos for fan favorites such as Belcarra, Blessed Be and Rule of Nines and it's clear to see that the band are no strangers to the macabre or paranormal. Having toured the world many times over with their previous bands - metal outfit iwrestledabearonce (Courtney and Mike) and pop punk band Living With Lions (Bill) - Spiritbox absorbed the highs and lows of living as working musicians and decided to try a different and more sustainable approach when it came to releasing their music. They took the concept of supply and demand and applied it to their release model, focusing on making fans across the globe by using the social media tools available to them, releasing shorter bodies of music and removing touring from the plan until a demand was built. In doing so they quickly garnered a cult-like online following which has lead to over 10,000,000 streams across all platforms and sell outs on every physical release and most merch items they've released to date. In Feb of 2020 Spiritbox jumped on a plane and finally went on tour in support of After The Burial across Europe, which was unfortunately cut short due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Despite having to return to Canada early, Spiritbox have remained busy - releasing their latest single Holy Roller which debuted number 25 on the Billboard Hot Hard Rock Songs chart and debuted on Sirius XM Liquid Metal at number 9, climbing to number 1 for 7 consecutive weeks on the Devils Dozen countdown.

He's a singer of clear tenor with an emotional range befitting that of his namesake Bob Dylan. During his college years he maintained an esprit de corps with fellow pop song enthusiasts. In his twenties he whittled it down to a foursome fierce with alt-rock sensibilities named M.Headphone with whom he stormed the San Francisco music scene from 1998-2003. A solo artist since 2004, Connor is set to release his 5th full-length in the first half of '21. In contemporary quarantine fashion, the new record is a Kickstarter-funded effort that sees the artist playing virtually all instruments. With producer Coley O'Toole of the platinum-selling band We The Kings behind the boards for this new batch of songs, Connor expands his sonic soundscape while sharpening his thematic focus. The tentatively titled \"Infinity Days\" will be available on all major digital platforms. Son. Husband. Father. Teacher. Humanitarian. As a lyricist, Dylan Connor's subject material draws from such titles. Rooted in the craft of classic singer/songwriters and inspired by cultures of the world, Connor continues in the tradition of Billy Bragg, Ben Folds, and Tom Petty. Present-day comparisons include Dawes, Nada Surf, and Phoebe Bridgers, while Connor himself claims kindred spirit influences including Jeff Buckley, Matthew Sweet's power pop, and Death Cab For Cutie. 2004's \"Plug In\" marked the first of four collaborations with acclaimed producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads) and saw Dylan Connor recognized by American Songwriter Magazine with a nod for Best Lyrics. Ten years and several album/touring cycles later, Connor released 2014's \"Blood Like Fire (Songs For Syria)\" \u2013 a charity project highlighting the war in Syria with 100% of proceeds allocated to the education of Syrian refugees via the Karam Foundation. Connor then contributed his song \"Man of Peace\" to the 2016 feature film documentary \"Little Gandhi\" by writer/director Sam Kadi that became Syria's first official submission for \"Best Foreign Language Film\" during the 90th Academy Awards. Connor also serves as Chair of Missions for the Syrian-American Council and has embarked upon humanitarian expeditions to the Syrian border to deliver aid and help raise awareness in solidarity with all those affected by the nearly decade-long war. Connor first came to love the country and its people after having married a Syrian immigrant and making several visits to her homeland. The spiritual union with his Syrian partner led to the cognizant evolution of his art. Once the revolution began, Connor knew he would not remain silent. \"If Only You'd Listen\" (2019) \u2013 a single co-written and produced by Coley O'Toole \u2013 features Connor's empathetic voice amidst an ornate, Beatles-esque arrangement. A song of stately immediacy imploring adult listeners to take action on behalf of children amidst today's combined crises of climate change, gun violence and war, \"If Only You'd Listen\" has over 8 million streams online. February 2021 sees Dylan Connor contributing his current single \"Bring You Back\" to the theatrical and VOD release of \"Adverse,\" a new crime thriller starring Sean Astin and Mickey Rourke. \"Bring You Back\" was commissioned by writer/director Brian Metcalf after being impressed by Connor's talent, sincerity and knack for melody. Produced by Brooklyn-based musician Mark Mollica, \"Bring You Back\" strikes an elegiac tone while demonstrating Connor's ability to collaborate on another's creative vision. Anchored along the Connecticut shoreline where he lives with his wife and two children, Dylan Connor teaches Latin to high schoolers in between concert performances at venues like NYC\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, L.A.\u2018s The Mint, and CT\u2019s Fairfield Theatre Company.", "otherInfo": "Every Friday (almost) I will be playing a solo show at Las Vetas Lounge as I get warmed up for the release of my new record Infinity Days and for a fall 2021 tour."}, {"Address": "116 & Garden State Pkwy, Holmdel, NJ 07733", "Artist": "Hardy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11174633.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.3044719, -72.9262301], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "PNC Bank Arts Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4210 Palisades Cte Dr A - 401, West Nyack, NY 10994", "Artist": "Aaron Weber ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11215069.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.0981032, -73.95797979999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Comedy, Stand Up Comedy", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Levity Live - West Nyack", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron is a standup comedian based in Nashville, TN.

His sister Sara Watkins, also a member of Nickel Creek, plays violin and sings background vocals on the second of his two solo albums. As a whole, Nickel Creek recently participated in a project dubbed Mutual Admiration Society, a collaboration with former Toad The Wet Sprocket singer Glen Phillips. As a solo musician, Sean Watkins early material was contemporary bluegrass, but as time goes on, he has incorporated various other influences into his music (especially indie rock). Sean Watkins's solo music career seems to be going the same path as Nickel Creek; turning from beautiful traditional bluegrass songs to indie rock with bluegrass instrumentation. Sean Watkins is the oldest member of Nickel Creek. \"My first instrument was the piano when I was six\", Sean recalls. \"I took classic instruction for seven years, but three years into that I discovered bluegrass music, through my piano teacher's son, who had a bluegrass band that played every Saturday night at a pizza place in Carlsbad. I really got into it, and when Sara [Watkins] and I met Chris, we started playing with him on Saturday nights too.\"[1] He began playing mandolin in the early career with Nickel Creek, but later switched to guitar. Sean made it to the National Flatpicking Championship in 1993 at age 16. Now Nickel Creek has exploded in the contemporary folk/bluegrass scene. This Watkins has already released 3 solo albums and appeared on many others. Of this experience, Watkins has said, \"I've learned now to look back to music that has lasted through the years and to appreciate the timeless value that it has.\" Sean's first album Let it Fall consists primarily of bluegrass inspired instrumental tracks. Providing the vocals on the only sung track on the album is former Toad the Wet Sprocket frontman Glen Phillips. Sean's second album, 26 Miles was a much bigger departure from bluegrass. While still mainly acoustic, the album showed influences from jazz, indie rock, and new age music. His third album, Blinder's On continues along many of the same lines as the previous one. It was recently announced on Nickel Creek's website that the band would go on hiatus at the end of 2007. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Sean states that he plans to make music for movies.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "5th & Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Consider the Source ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11501362.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.748189, -95.97160199999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Metal, Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Instrumental, Stoner Metal, World Fusion, Prog-rock, Jam Bands", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Wonder Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Sci-fi fusion trio Consider the Source defy easy categorization. If intergalactic energy beings, upon their initiation into an order of whirling dervishes, built a pan-dimensional booty-shaking engine powered by psychedelic math...it would sound like a cut-rate CTS cover band. With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers. Their latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity. From the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound. This is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove. CTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents. They have shared the stage with a wide variety of artists, including: Victor Wooten, King Crimson Projekt, Wyclef Jean, Ozric Tentacles, Soulive, The Disco Biscuits, Papadosio, Turkuaz, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Wayne Krantz and many others.

This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity).

Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Kaleta. The singer, guitarist and percussionist from the West African country of Benin Republic lived his adolescent life in Lagos, Nigeria where Afrobeat was born. Kaleta performed and toured the world with the gods, Fela Kuti and King Sunny Ade, along with Majek Fashek and recently Lauryn Hill. Now based in New York City, Kaleta was overjoyed to find Super Yamba Band and hear their take on the vintage, psychedelic sounds of his native country. Super Yamba takes its cues from artists like Orchestre Poly-Rythmo, El Rego and The Funkees all legends in their own right for pioneering the classic styles of Afro-Funk and Afro-Rock in Benin and Nigeria. Super Yamba Band have dialed in the nuances of some of the rarest grooves out there with a timeless sound that will move everyone in the room to dance! Kaleta got his start in the late 70s performing in church and was soon after picked up by iconic Juju master and world music pioneer King Sunny Ade. A few years later Fela Kuti came calling. Kaleta would go on to tour the world playing guitar for the King of Afrobeat in his band Egypt 80 through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Audiences will hear Kaleta sing in several different languages native to West Africa including Fon, Goun, Yoruba and Ewe, along with French and Pidgin English, \"the official language of Afrobeat\" he says with a grin. Super Yamba Band's live performances with Kaleta are absolutely explosive. Afropop Worldwide said \"their ace-up-the-sleeve: the singer Kaleta, whose James Brown grunts have got to be some of the best in the business.\" With Kaleta at the helm Super Yamba Band have recently erupted onto stages at Paste Magazine's Emerging Music Festival, World Music Institute's Masters Of African Music Series, The Untitled Action Bronson Show (Viceland TV), Secret Planet APAP 2018 Showcase and more, giving audiences an unforgettable experience of world-class Afro-Funk dance music.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "14 Wharf Ave, Red Bank, NJ 07701", "Artist": "The Cliffs Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9698854.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.3528129, -74.0648715], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Red Rock", "moreBioInfo": "We are an 8 piece supergroup, comprised of seasoned musicians playing the songs you know and love!", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "131 W 3rd St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Ron Carter ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7309083, -74.0006557], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blue Note Jazz Club", "moreBioInfo": "Ron Carter (born May 4, 1937, Ferndale, Michigan) is an American jazz bassist.

Her first, 2017's Infinite Worlds, was an indie breakthrough that put her on the map, prompting Tamko to tour around the world and quit her job in electrical/computer engineering to pursue a career in music full-time. Tamko's Nonesuch Records debut All The Women In Me, finds her in a state of creative expansion, leaning fully into some of the experimental instincts she flirted with on the previous album. This time around, she's throwing genre to the wind. All The Women In Me is a vibrant culmination of influences, emotional landscapes, and moods; a colorful and masterful statement by an artist and producer stepping into her own. \"I was in a pretty tortured headspace when I returned home from touring Infinite Worlds. That album contained some of the first songs I'd ever written, and more people than I could have ever imagined heard it,\" Tamko says. \"I was proud to become a full-time musician and recognized how rare of a thing that is, but was also debilitated by the very same fact. Fear overtook me and I couldn't write. I felt stagnant and unsure of what to do next.\" That anxiety eventually thawed and gave way to a newfound sense of freedom as Tamko began to focus less on industry pressures and more on honing her craft as a songwriter and producer. \"With this album, I wanted to impress myself,\" Tamko says. \"I wanted to be curious and I wanted to make big leaps as a producer. All I had access to on the road was my computer and Logic, so naturally I started writing songs electronically with what was at hand.\" All The Women In Me was written and produced entirely by Tamko. Guitar-driven melodies are largely absent, and in their place we are treated to a collection of songs buoyed by hybridized analog and digital arrangements. While Infinite Worlds situated the last Vagabon project in the realm of \"indie rock,\" All The Women In Me is not easily defined. Grounded by Tamko's expressive voice and knack for unique melodies, the album flits between genres, never lingering too long on one particular sensibility. Lead single \"Flood Hands\" exemplifies this growth; the production ebbs like a gentle tide before a cavernous drumbeat kicks in and the tone shifts completely. \"I know, even if I run from it I'm still in it,\" Tamko sings over and over again, her capacious voice conveying a sense of resignation in the face of an external force beyond her control. The chorus is a hypnotic bit of pop alchemy that lingers long after the runtime. \"The drums and vocal forward approach I took on All The Women In Me is drawn from my love for rap and hip-hop production as well as R&B and folk storytelling. That's the music that got me excited about writing again,\" Tamko says. In addition to those influences, the West African guitars and rhythms that soundtracked much of her childhood seep into moments throughout this album, in no place more obvious than on \"In A Bind.\" The song opens with a fingerpicked melody as Tamko sings to someone she's been orbiting for a while but can't quite reach. \"I know that I was gone a lot last year/ But I hoped you'd still be here,\" she sings. After that, words no longer serve, and lyrics are replaced by robust, choral vocals singing the refrain: \"Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.\" \"I drew some inspiration from the Malian musician Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 while writing that song. There is a part on his song 'Savane' where he and his band are feeling the music so much that he just says, 'Yes,' in the middle of the track,\" Tamko explains. \"It's almost as if the music is coming from a higher power. That's a staple in so much of the African music I love, and when I started writing 'In a Bind' I was overcome in a similar way.\" Tamko didn't set out with one particular lyrical theme in mind when she started writing All The Women In Me, and as a result, this album offers up a spectrum of moods to marinate in. Songs like the album's opener \"Full Moon In Gemini,\" the thumping bedroom dance track \"Water Me Down,\" and the collage piece \"Please Don't Leave The Table\" illustrate blinding moments of personal insight that speak to universal themes. Other lyrics came to Tamko with clear intention. Inspired by a Nayyirah Waheed poem, the title track, \"All The Women,\" is a thesis statement, though it arrives near the very end of the album. \"This song poured out of me and showed itself as an anthem for myself and for all of the people who are marginalized by our society. 'Women' in this case isn't gendered, it's a placeholder for those who are not always welcome and not always protected. This song exists for all of us to see each other and find each other,\" Tamko says. \"The song is also a thank-you letter to the women who raised me, the women who look like me, the women who work in all of the genres of music that guided this album, 'the women who run with the wolves.'\" On \"Wits About You,\" Tamko opens up more space for those who have found themselves positioned as The Other when she sings: \"I was invited to the party/ They won't let my people in/ Well then never mind, never mind, never mind.\" Later, the stunning slow burn \"Home Soon\" finds Tamko meditating on what it feels like to truly belong to a place, a community. She's joined by a consortium of friends, who sing along with her over a trembling string arrangement. \"At dawn, I'll be home soon,\" they affirm in unison. \"Home has always been a major theme in my music, and when I say I make music for outcasts, I am also talking about those who feel far from home or uncomfortable where they're at,\" Tamko says. \"To me, home isn't a physical space so much as it is a mental state. I'm writing about wanting to feel safe and at home in my body and in my mind and in the community I move in. I want Vagabon to be a project that people searching for the same thing can connect with.\"", "otherInfo": "Vagabon"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Shinyribs ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8522987.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Country-soul, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "CANCELED - City Winery NYC", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "This event has been canceled due to the pandemic.

La m\u00fasica ya lo hab\u00eda atenazado desde que un compa\u00f1ero del colegio le propuso ser parte de la banda de rock que ten\u00eda junto con sus hermanos. La banda se llamaba Tercer Mundo. Ese fue el comienzo. Diez a\u00f1os de giras enloquecidas, fan\u00e1ticas adolescentes al borde de la histeria, camisas ra\u00eddas y mil historias compartidas en el camino, fueron suficientes y le llevaron a decidir buscar su propio camino, solo.

Cuando empezaba a pensar en su siguiente trabajo, Para que no me olvides se filtr\u00f3 en Colombia y se volvi\u00f3 un \u00e9xito, logrando esta vez Disco de Platino y renombre internacional. A partir de all\u00ed se iniciar\u00eda una fuerte relaci\u00f3n del cantautor con Colombia. En el 2002 public\u00f3 su segundo \u00e1lbum, Tanto Amor , que muestra a Juan Fernando Velasco como un m\u00fasico y productor creativo, capaz de imprimir matices y propuestas musicales innovadoras en cada canci\u00f3n.

Aqu\u00ed se inicia una extensa gira de conciertos masivos con localidades agotadas en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, confirmando que Velasco no s\u00f3lo vende, sino que es capaz de atrapar a audiencias muy diversas que encuentran en \u00e9l y en su m\u00fasica una propuesta novedosa, seria y genuina. En el 2006 Juan Fernando realiz\u00f3 varias presentaciones importantes, entre ellas, la realizada junto a Franco de Vita en el Madison Square Garden de la ciudad de Nueva York en Febrero pasado. Adem\u00e1s de estos logros profesionales, su lado humano y su compromiso social son reconocidos con diferentes condecoraciones y nombramientos.

He is always trying to stretch, grow, and in turn, hone his sound. The writer, producer, singer and multi-instrumentalist, was raised in Upstate NY. Kevin began assembling bands in high school and started playing gigs on the weekends. He found himself jamming with adult musicians and being able to keep up. \u201cThat\u2019s how I started learning how to connect with audiences, and how to create music,\u201d he says. Kevin has a virtuosic gift when it comes to the guitar, but not one to be pinned down, he plays several other instruments as well. In his late teens, Kevin Andreas began teaching guitar lessons and learning audio engineering. At the age of twenty-two he was able to relocate to New York City and opened his own recording studio in Williamsburg. Kevin spent time behind the spotlight as a sideman, studio musician, singer/writer, and producer. During this time, he co-wrote and sang the hook on, A$AP Rocky\u2019s breakout hit, \u201cPeso.\u201d He is also the musical director for comedienne Sandra Bernhard. Andreas released an introductory project for fans that took off beyond expectation. Vents Magazine called it \u201csexy, haunting and utterly awesome\u201d while Paste Magazine cited the song as an \u201cempowering anthem that combines energetic instrumentation and rock bombast with a soft, soulful melody.\u201d A track was featured on Filtr\u2019s Spotify \u201cNEW MUSIC\u201d playlist, as well as Filtr\u2019s \u201cArtists to Watch\u201d Spotify playlist. By late 2016, the track had garnered enough acclaim to warrant Spotify to place it on \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d leading the track to garner 75k+ streams, all while still completely independent. Kevin just released his brand new single, \u201cFRIEND$\u201d in July of 2017. The new track has a soulful summer vibe, that features a catchy hook and an undeniable bouncy beat. Kevin was chosen to perform as direct support for Sabrina Carpenter (Hollywood Records) at Musikfest, and has also opened for Andy Grammer. He has performed at notable NYC venues such as Highline Ballroom, Brooklyn Bowl, Gramercy Theater and Webster Hall. Kevin continues to perform in and around NYC and will be touring this upcoming fall / winter. Andreas is currently finishing up his debut solo LP and is looking to release the album in the coming months. Tracks featuring Andreas\u2019 otherworldly guitar playing, along with his contemporary pop and hip-hop sensibilities, will be highlighted on the LP.

He began studying the piano at the age of eight, and five years later switched to electric guitar. He soon discovered his passion for improvisation and jazz, and during his high school years he began to travel regularly to Tel Aviv to study with Israel\u2019s leading musicians, and to participate in workshops and master classes. At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium. The band has performed in opening act concerts for renowned artists as Avishai Cohen, Bojan Z, Rabia Abu-Khalil and Kyle Eastwood, and played in numerous Jazz festivals, concert halls and jazz clubs in France and Europe, including Nancy Jazz Pulsations, La D\u00e9fense Jazz Festival, Sunset/Sunside Jazz Club (Paris), Jazz \u00e0 Staint-G\u00e9rmain-des-Pr\u00e8s Festival (Paris), Guitar Art Caf\u00e9 (Belgrade, Serbie), Budo Tomovic Theater (Podgorica, Mont\u00e9n\u00e9gro), National theaters of Amiens, Sceaux & Valencienne. In 2012 Yuval released his first album with his quintet, \"Yuval Amihai Ensemble\", which was acclaimed by critics and received the \"Chosen Album\" label by French leading jazz critics website CitizenJazz.com. This was followed by a full support by the SACEM organisation's grants program for self-produced albums. In 2015, Yuval records his second album \"LONGING\" with his new trio, including bass player Damien Varaillon and drummer Gautier Garrigue. The album was released May 25, 2015 (distributed by L'Autre Distribution). Acclaimed by critics it receives the \"Chosen album\u201d label by CitizenJazz.com as well as the \u201cDiscovery\u201d label in the Jazz News magazine.

He\u2019s been a staple in the NY/NJ club scene going on 20 years. For a DJ-Producer, that\u2019s a lifetime. But for Louie DeVito, it is simply his life. On any given weekend night, he can be found playing sets to packed rooms, wall-to-wall bodies writhing on the dance floor. That is when DeVito is his happiest. \u201cI love feeling the vibe of the room,\u201d he explains. Big or small, domestic or international, he loves them all. \u201cI\u2019ve played rooms of 350 to rooms of thousands. Playing good music, reading the crowd, giving them what they want \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d That ideology of \u201cgiving them what they want\u201d has made him seem like a \u201csellout\u201d to some of his fellow DJs. His compilation \u201cN.Y.C. Underground Party,\u201d released on his own independent label Elastik, has sold more than 500,000 copies to date \u2013 enough to land him in the Guinness Book of World Records for all-time best-selling DJ mix compilation. Ironically, there\u2019s nothing \u201cunderground\u201d about the mix. DeVito admits this himself, laughing about it. \u201cFor the hardcore, serious clubber, there is nothing \u2018underground\u2019 about it. But it depends on who you\u2019re asking. For the average mainstream clubber, it\u2019s very underground \u2013 no dance remixes of pop hits here.\u201d DeVito\u2019s bread and butter comes from catering to a crowd craving an indulgent blend of radio-friendly club smashes. Big dance anthems with soaring vocals and huge stadium-sizes synths and riffs, with the requisite massive build-up and break. \u201cThis big room sound is what I\u2019m into playing these days,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely popular. It also sounds good on any and every sound system. I want to see hands in the air, people dancing and going crazy. This sound makes it happen.\u201d DeVito recently released a remix of Sweet Rains feat. Reina \u201cForever\u201d on indie label Lafayette Street Records. \u201cReina\u2019s big vocals on this track leant itself to a big-room, anthemic remix. I worked with my partner Alessandro Calemme. I\u2019m proud of this remix and love the response it gets.\u201d DeVito\u2019s weekly podcast iluvhouse is currently getting thousands of downloads weekly and is in the Top 50 on iTunes in the genre.

However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are, in fact, a few fucks the guys do give when it comes to their music. Which they have no problem showing.In the studio, Sedz and Fish channel their unabashed, fuck-all attitudes into tracks like their sultry debut single \u201cFace Down\u201d, and the lush vocal cut \u201cEcho\u201d. The guys coin an atmospheric and deep-leaning sound that\u2019s suited to no one particular environment. As Fish tells it, \u201cyou should be able to enjoy it everywhere.\u201d Mates since childhood, Cut Snake grew up on the Gold Coast of Australia; surfing professionally and competing against each other from the time they were 12. In this time, they developed the hilarious banter and incredible dynamic that is still prevalent in interviews and on stage. The guys got into dance music while they were touring the world for surf contests and quickly grew passionate about the underground scenes from each country they visited. With plenty of time waiting for waves, they fine-tuned their production skills from beachfront bungalows, giving their music a fresh feel and their live show a vibe like no other. Outside of their wildly successful surf careers, Sedz channeled his passion and focus for the sport into his music production, and for that he\u2019s known as the \u201cmad scientist\u201d of the duo. Fish is known for his web series, Followthefish.tv. His wild personality and contagious laugh have made him one of the biggest personalities in the surfing industry to date. Now that Cut Snake has relocated stateside and inked a deal with Three Six Zero / Warner Bros. Records, the guys flout the seriousness of the scene in every way possible.

There is a vine, Liana, which grows from tree to tree, holding the forest together through all of nature\u2019s changing moods. These vines form a net, which hovers 20 or so feet above ground level. Monkeys and other adventurous life forms often jump from great heights only to land comfortably in this net of vines. Liana can become so heavy, that it pulls down older and weaker trees, constantly catalyzing new life in the rain forest. For the Ghanaian people, Liana has been a symbol of strength and unity, across a great network of life. Joe Galeota brought me to Ghana in 2003 as part of his annual trip to experience Ewe music, dance and culture. We studied at the Dagbe Cultural Center with the Agbeli family in Kopeiya, a village in the southeastern Volta region. We were introduced to the ancestors of the Agbeli family and their land. We studied with master drummer Emmanuel Agbeli and lead dancer Victor Agbeli. While in Ghana we also had the privilege to study at the Dargara Bewaa Cultural Center, outside of Accra. This is the house of master xylophonist Bernard Woma. We studied the Gyil, a fourteen keyed balafon made from completely organic materials. The Gyil appears once on this record in the \u201cTodjo Suite\u201d. It was at Bernard\u2019s house where I began to arrange traditional Gyil music for the guitar. Upon returning to Philadelphia I continued to study and arrange what I had learned. In the blossoming Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia, I began to teach this music, holding weekly workshops for free. This naturally grew into a bi-weekly happening where the communal traditions of Ewe social music were performed. This ensemble became the group Leana Song. The way we spell Leana, was the way I pictured the word. Though traditionally spelled \u2018Liana\u2019, \u2018Leana\u2019 has meaning when you split the letters apart. Le, a term used for the raffia leggings worn by adjogbo (adzohu) dancers, and A\u00f1a, coming from the bat\u00e1 tradition and referring to the spirit within the drum. This works well because Ewe music brought Leana Song together and bat\u00e1 music has sustained us. This first volume of Orisha Love Songs, primarily has arrangements of Cuban Lucum\u00ed songs, with three arrangements of Ewe music. We look forward to creating the next volume of Orisha Love Songs, and we thank you for your support of our work. Ashe Moyuba.

Blues Music Magazine calls them \u201cthe best little big band in the blues.\u201d On record and on stage, Roomful of Blues\u2014led by master guitarist Chris Vachon for the past 22 years\u2014continues to deliver its bone-shaking mix of original songs and carefully chosen covers ranging from jump, swing and proto rock \u2018n\u2019 roll to funky, contemporary blues. Their impeccable musicianship and larger-than-life vocals have earned Roomful of Blues five Grammy Award nominations and a slew of other accolades, including seven Blues Music Awards. Twice, the prestigious DownBeat International Critics\u2019 Poll has selected them as Best Blues Band. And now, even after 18 previous releases and thousands of live shows, Roomful of Blues continues to evolve, as they return with In A Roomful Of Blues, their first new studio album since 2011. In A Roomful Of Blues, the band\u2019s sixth release on Alligator Records, was produced by Vachon and features 13 wide-ranging songs, including nine band-composed originals\u2014more than on any previous Roomful album. Eight songs were written or co-written by Vachon (including one authored with vocalist Phil Pemberton) plus one each by sax player Alek Razdan and keyboardist Rusty Scott. From the rocking We\u2019d Have A Love Sublime to the funkified You Move Me to the closing-time lament She Quit Me Again to the up-to-the-minute Phone Zombies, In A Roomful Of Blues is filled with soaring blues, zydeco twists, late-night ballads, Latin-tinged funk and a touch of vintage, fifth-gear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Roomful of Blues guitarist Chris Vachon first joined Roomful in 1990, and has been leading the band since 1998. Guitar Player says Vachon\u2019s guitar playing \u201cburns with explosive solos and a delightfully greasy sense of rhythm.\u201d The band has maintained its signature sound through great musicianship and a stellar horn section\u2014featuring tenor and alto saxophonist Rich Lataille, who first joined the band in 1970. Lataille\u2019s masterful playing can evoke either the fat-toned, honking sax of the glory days of early rock or the cool elegance of big band swing jazz. While Roomful of Blues has always been one of the tightest, most joyful blues ensembles in the world, they have never sounded fresher or stronger than with the current line-up. Along with Vachon and Lataille, the band includes vocalist Phil Pemberton, baritone and tenor saxophonist Alek Razdan, trumpeter Carl \u201cGeerz\u201d Gerhard, bassist John Turner, drummer Chris Anzalone and keyboardist Rusty Scott. The long and winding road which leads to the Roomful of Blues of today can be followed all the way back to 1967 when a group of southern Rhode Island teenagers with a shared passion for the blues formed a straight-ahead Chicago-style electric blues band to explore the music of their heroes. They added a horn section (including Rich Lataille) in 1970 and released their self-titled debut album in 1977 on Island Records (reissued on Hyena Records), which brought them to the attention of fans and critics from coast to coast. Recording for Rounder Records\u2019 Bullseye Blues and Varrick labels between 1980 and 2001, the band cut nine albums that won them international fame and major rock radio airplay. They\u2019ve gigged with stars ranging from bluesmen B.B. King, Otis Rush and Stevie Ray Vaughan to rockers Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana. The band has performed in cities from coast to coast, and traveled abroad to 22 countries including Lebanon, Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and Russia. Since Roomful joined the Alligator Records family in 2003, their popularity has continued to increase. Their first Alligator CD was the Grammy-nominated That\u2019s Right! in 2003, followed by Standing Room Only in 2005, Raisin\u2019 A Ruckus in 2008, Hook, Line & Sinker in 2010 and 45 Live in 2013. All five albums received massive amounts of critical and popular praise and kept old and new fans lining up to see them perform. The New Yorker says the band brings \u201cthunderous performances that get feet stomping and hands clapping.\u201d With In A Roomful Of Blues, the band has once again captured all of their frenetic energy and musical power in the studio. Roomful of Blues will be hitting the road and bringing the new material to their fans around the world, proving without doubt that this is a band built to stand the test of time. While keenly aware of the group\u2019s half century of history, Vachon is quick to note, however, that they are constantly looking forward. \u201cWe always keep things fresh and we keep the excitement level high.

His earliest exposure to music came at home, thanks to an extended family of musicians and ready access to a wealth of Colombian genres. By the age of 12, Torres was performing with various Bogot\u00e1 ensembles, developing techniques that allowed him to quickly adapt to the demands of jazz, pop music, and salsa. A classically trained percussionist, he earned a degree in Music Composition from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s esteemed Universidad Javeriana. Before departing for the U.S. in 1999, the resourceful young artist had become an established figure on Colombia\u2019s fertile music scene, backing leading Colombian performers while serving as an arranger and music director for his country\u2019s highly regarded telenovelas (TV soap operas) and films.\nShortly after arriving in the U.S., his career took a dramatic turn when he was tapped by famed trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval to join his group. Torres spent four years touring the world and recording with the jazz great, polishing his ever-expanding talents while attracting the attention of a long list of renowned artists with whom he would eventually collaborate. Over time, he would perform with a veritable \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the jazz, Latin pop, and salsa world, including such luminaries as Tito Puente, Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker, Don Byron, Claudio Roditi, Richard Bona, Poncho Sanchez, Lila Downs, Marc Anthony, Thal\u00eda, and his country\u2019s own international superstar, Shakira. His talents have also been featured in concerts with the Boston Pops, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Nashville Symphony and at a host of music festivals around the world.\nMore recently Torres was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Classical Album with the production \"Regreso,\" an incredible project done in collaboration with the Nueva Filarmon\u00eda of Bogot\u00e1."}, {"Address": "371 south Franklin Ave, Belleville, NJ 07109", "Artist": "Annie Mash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11590219.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.80266049999999, -74.170351], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Annie Mash Duo at Brix", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Back at our favorite pizza place!!"}, {"Address": "115 Macdougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Mike O'Malley ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7301811, -74.0007016], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Wha", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1315 NJ-17, Ramsey, NJ 07446", "Artist": "Whiskey Crossing ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11286654.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.0719092, -74.1411081], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Whiskey Crossing Trio at Ramsey Tap Room and Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Whiskey Crossing is a rising Country Blues/Country Rock duo that surely brings the heat and excitement into the room.

Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019.

Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves.

Orleans began as a trio in 1972 in Woodstock NY. Guitarist John Hall, drummer Wells Kelly and multi-instrumentalist Larry Hoppen played tirelessly all over the Northeast and up / down the Eastern \u201ccorridor\u201d for nine months, then added Lance Hoppen (Larry\u2019s brother) fresh out of high school on bass to form the quartet that would record its debut LP in 1973 at the legendary Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama. Orleans found its core audience touring the clubs and college circuit of the Northeast US, crossing paths with other up-and-comers such as Bonnie Raitt, Tom Waits, and Hall & Oates. Rolling Stone called Orleans \"the best unrecorded band in America\". Showcase performances in NYC gave rise to a recording contract with ABC Dunhill Records and the release of an eponymous debut album in 1973. But it was not until Orleans was produced by Chuck Plotkin, then head of A&R for Asylum Records, that the band scored its first Top 40 hit with \"Let There Be Music\" in early 1975. The follow up single \"Dance With Me\" brought Orleans into the Top 5 and the mainstream of American pop music. Atypical of the high-energy, earthy, R&B/Rock 'n' Roll mix of styles they had been previously identified with, \"Dance With Me\" cast the band in a more \"soft-rock\" light and landed them a tour with Melissa Manchester, when they really were more at home on tour with bands such as Little Feat. It was the smash hit \"Still the One\" that cemented Orleans' relationship with the American public. While the single was climbing the charts all the way to #2, the band did a major cross-country tour with label-mate Jackson Browne. However, within a year internal stresses prompted guitarist/songwriter Hall to leave the band in search of a solo career, as \"Still the One\" played ceaselessly as the ABC TV network theme song. Since then it has been used for countless commercials and movie soundtracks. The Hoppen brothers and Kelly reunited the band and, in 1979, produced the Top 10 hit \"Love Takes Time\", continuing to tour with the likes of Stephen Stills and Chicago. Collectively, the three Orleans' hits have been aired over 7 million times. One of the many signatures of Orleans was and still is harmony guitar riffs and two serious players trading rhythm and lead between them, all seamlessly. Larry and John were, for most of this still\u2013active band\u2019s 35-year-and\u2013counting career, those players. When John Hall left for a solo stint in 1977, Orleans found Dennis \u201cFly\u2019 Amero, a lefty, upside-down Strat player (in the manner of Jimi Hendrix) who took over for several years. After original drummer Wells Kelly passed away in October 1984, Larry, Lance and John played at his Memorial event. Out of this, they decided to work together as Orleans again, starting with a Nashville album. From 1985 through 2006 (when John got elected to the US Congress \u2013 D, NY-19) the group always included the three original members. Over those years, another 8 albums were released, always containing new material. In 2001 the band added Lane Hoppen, the third brother, as a permanent member. Shortly after, Charlie Morgan \u2013 drummer with Elton John for 13 years \u2013 also joined the group. Early in 2006, as John Hall began his election campaign, Fly Amero was asked back by the band \u2013 including John - roughly 25 years after Fly\u2019s first \u2018term\u2019. Fly agreed, and a smooth transition ensued. (Orleans\u2019 2006 \u201cWe\u2019re Still Havin\u2019 Fun\u201d DVD features BOTH John and Fly.) Fly and Larry\u2019s guitar chemistry is obvious, as is the whole group\u2019s camaraderie. Besides being a great guitarist, songwriter and singer with a strong blues/R&B soulful tilt, Fly is great with a crowd and has a Gold Record for comedy music featuring his parody lyrics. Here in 2008, John is up for Congressional re-election and Fly is a permanent Orleans member, as are Charlie, Lane and original mainstays Lance and Larry (who is the voice on all the radio hits, by the way). Thirty-five years in, Orleans\u2019 trademarked slogan couldn\u2019t be more appropriate: \u201cWe\u2019re Still Havin\u2019 Fun\u201d.

The quartet of Horvath, guitarist Dave Whitehead, drummer Chris Ryan and bassist Christopher Rousseau enthralls listeners with irresistible hooks and captivates them with intelligent layers of sound. In 2001, The Council released its debut album Coloursound (The Sinclair Recording Co.). Coloursound made its radio debut on Little Steven\u2019s internationally syndicated radio show \u201cUnderground Garage\" and the first single \u201cSitting on a Cloud\u201d, was named the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d in April 2002. In 2006 the band released its second full-length album, The Fall Parade (Groove Disques Records), which was nominated for \u201cBest New Release\u201d and \u201cBest Album\u201d by the Asbury Park Music Awards. The album quickly made its way to the Billboard Garage Rock charts on the strength of its first single \u201cPinkerton\u2019s Assorted Colours\u201d which entered at number one and propelled the The Fall Parade to number nine. Both the single and album remained in the Top 10 charting for three months straight. The second single \u201cStrawberry Smell\u201d, which is featured on the soundtrack of award-winning film I\u2019m Reed Fish (2007), continues to spin regularly on Underground Garage and radio stations across North America. In 2012 The Anderson Council completed and released their 3rd full length album, Looking at the Stars. Recorded in Highland Park, New Jersey by Kurt Reil (leader of the Grip Weeds, and producer of Mark Lindsey and The Smithereens) on Sinclair Records, \u201cLooking at the Stars\u201d featured 13 new songs ranging from high-energy 60\u2019s power pop to 70\u2019s Mod Revival to 00\u2019s British re-invasion. Their video for the single and lead off track \"Don't You Think\" received extensive views online on YouTube and in the blogosphere. The single also appeared in the Canadian film The Right Kind of Wrong (2013). The record continued to surge, behind the support Little Steven Van Zandt, who deemed a deeper cut, \"Gardening Man\" the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d on his Underground Garage Sirius XM radio (channel 21) and syndicated radio show. Combine that with a public endorsement from Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, annual appearances at multiple metro area music festivals and all was looking good in the power pop world for The Anderson Council. Over the next two years, the band stayed busy and productive playing shows and kept their name in the public eye. They made appearances on several tribute records, recording their versions of songs by Elvis Costello, Bobby Sutliff, The Posies, New Jersey\u2019s own, The Critters and most recently, the Canadian rock band, Sloan. In 2014 Christopher Rousseau joined the fold, taking over bass duties from long time member Rob Farrell. Energized, the band brought Christopher up to speed, and later that year, the band embarked on writing and demoing new material. The result is 2015\u2019s Listening Party!, a six song EP which gave their fans some well deserved tracks to spin while awaiting the next album. The EP tracklisting was unique in that each member contributed one original and chose one cover. In 2016, fresh from signing with Marty Scott\u2019s JEM Records, the band re entered The House of Vibes to cut some tracks. Scott\u2019s intention was to introduce the rest of the world to the sounds of The Anderson Council without having to purchase their catalog. Thus the idea behind Assorted Colours, an aural history of The Anderson Council was born. Under the stewardship of Reil, the band began a massive re-mastering of tracks from the first three albums. With the intention of including three tracks from each previously release along with 4 newly recorded \u201cjems\u201d. Assorted Colours combines the old with the new sounds in a seamless presentation. The remastering adds punch to previously released songs like \u201cWe\u2019re Like The Sun\u201d and \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d while the new tracks \u201cGirl on The Northern Line\u201d, \u201cI Never Feel\u201d, \u201cMagical\u201d and \u201cFire Island\u201d simply sparkle.

Stephen's new album titled \"Said & Done\" was released on February 27, 2016. The new LP draws on inspiration from his time in the southern United States as well as pop and Americana styles. Stephen began his musical career as a drummer, and his transition to a songwriter has weaved a percussive element into his guitar playing and singing. Since humble beginnings as a solo act around Central New York, Stephen has since finely tuned the performance and arrangement of his songs to compliment both bold full band shows and intimate acoustic events.

Formed in the mid 1990s, the band soon became a highly acclaimed musical force on the East Coast underground Jazz and Jam Band scene. This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut. The Bowery Ballroom in New York City along with various venues in Boston have hosted DBB recently as the main musical attraction. DBB were James \u201cFuzz\u201d San Giovanni, guitar/vocals, Eric Kalb, drums, Benj LeFevre, bass, Jen Durkin, vocals, Rob Somerville, sax/vocals, Rob Volo, trombone/guitar/vocals, Cyrus Madan, keyboards and Johnny Durkin, percussion.

Some voices you hear\u2026others you feel\u2026few artists, let alone singer-songwriters, possess the ability to seductively draw in a listener and then knock them out with a one-two punch\u2026Enter Nicola. Her blend of rock, pop & soul is of the strong female caliber; like Bonnie Raitt and K.T. Tunstall\u2026but make no mistake\u2026Nicola is Nicola. She is an accomplished singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and dancer, who has spent the last 10 years as a professional busker and musician in the NYC underground (as part of the sponsored \u201cMusic Under NY\u201d program). She has found an intimacy that can only exist where the constant rumble of trains drowns out most conversations, where the largest and toughest audiences in the world rush by, where you have to be damn good or you don\u2019t get to come back. This power house of a woman, rocks the New York underground like no other, but she\u2019s been rocking big stages and arenas above ground too. Born on the Lower East Side of NYC, Nicola grew up in the low-income projects, sharing toys with her baby brother. Her father was a mechanic, and her mother a nurse. Neither was musically inclined, but both shared their appreciation and love for all types of music with their kids. \u201cMusic was always playing in our house\u2026we grew up with the sounds of Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell, The Beatles,\u201d she recalls. It definitely rubbed off. Nicola ended up with a guitar in hand at age 7, a piano at age 11, and attended The Fiorello High School of the Arts (\u201cFame\u201d School). She trained classically at Manhattan School of Music and Queens College while studying dance and acting on the side. It wasn\u2019t long before she landed roles in both the critically acclaimed Broadway and National Road Companies of Les Miserables. Leaving the theater to embark on a music career, Nicola started her own record label \u201cHot Cherry Records\u201d in 2002. She toured the country and spent time living and performing in Europe and South America. Having recently opened for Eve 6, Nicola has shared the stage with Ricky Martin & Muzz Skillings of \u201cLiving Color\u201d. Over the past few years and 4 independently released CDs, having sold over 50,000 units independently, and charted on over 200 national radio stations, Nicola with her hybrid brand of sultry pop/rock/soul music has racked up an impressive list of rock and pop credentials: she's been featured on ABC, CBS & NBC News, Oxygen\u2019s \u201cBad Girls Club\u201d, MTV, VH1, Women Who Rock Magazine, Songwriter Universe Magazine, EMI/Songcircle Music, National Songwriters Hall of Fame , and she's performed at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. While performing in the subway, Nicola was scouted by EMI, Sony and Billboard Magazine, and was featured and showcased twice in Billboard Magazine\u2019s \u201cUnderground LP\u201d section for Noteworthy Emerging Artists about to break. The lead singer of the popular band \u201cTOTR\u201d on Interscope Records heard her performing at Union Square not long ago, and asked her to sing on the album they were recording at that time. She was briefly signed with Star Crossed Artist Group (\"Third Eye Blind\") and opened up for \"Eve 6\" and Edwin McCain. Nicola is on the development as well as writing and performance teams for several original prospective Broadway-bound musicals, and is endorsed by Martin Guitars Artist Program, Lampifier Microphones and Dovetail Strings. Nicola\u2019s 5th. album \u201cCanyons and Cathedrals\u201d, released October 2012, was a very complete tapestry of some of her most poetic soulful pop/rock music yet. A unique sonic journey from start to finish, the album contains 14 compositions and even includes 1 instrumental piece. Nicola released her latest single \"Back in Pieces October 2017 which was co-written and co-produced by Matt Colligan. She is Composer/Lyricist for a new original Broadway-Bound Musical called \"We are Ameena\" with A2K Productions. Above or below ground \u2013 to experience Nicola live is to be drawn in completely by a high-energy pop/rock/soul mix of driving beats, melodies and intelligent lyrics. All this is anchored by her sizzling vocals and rhythmic guitar chops. Nicola\u2019s performances whether full band or \u201cunplugged\u201d reveal an innate ability not just to dazzle an audience with her fiery presence\u2026but to somehow make you part of it\u2026and that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026", "otherInfo": "Nicola live unplugged at Starving Artist Caf\u00e9 \n249 City Island Ave.\nBx, NY\nwww.starvingartistonline.com"}, {"Address": "115 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Between Giants ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11311312.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7301811, -74.0007016], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Pop, Indie Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Player's Theatre Rooftop Show", "moreBioInfo": "\u25b2\u2022 your favorite indie-rock boys from brooklyn \u25bc", "otherInfo": "Original music on the player's theatre rooftop :-)"}, {"Address": "407 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Gabrielle Stravelli ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11471857.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7587924, -73.9930633], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Gabrielle Stravelli Trio LIVE at the West Bank Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cListening to the jazz singer Gabrielle Stravelli is like imbibing a potent cocktail whose flavor changes as you drain the glass\u2026a confidence and playfulness that recalled Ella Fitzgerald in her prime\u2026\u201d -The New York Times Gabrielle Stravelli was born in New York and raised in New Jersey by parents who had very eclectic taste in music; her childhood home was full of the sounds of swing, big band, opera, R&B, gospel, musical theater and 1970s and 80s pop.

Adalberto's relaxed and flawless lead vocals are amongst the best in salsa, and for over two decades he has sessioned as a coro (chorus) singer on countless New York recordings. His early influences included the great Cuban vocalists Beny Mor\u00e9 and Miguelito Cun\u00ed (b. 8 May 1920, Pinar del R\u00edo, Cuba, d. 5 March 1984, Havana, Cuba). Santiago started his professional career singing with trios and playing bass and guitar. After stints with the bands of Chu\u00edto V\u00e9lez, Willie Rodr\u00edguez and Willie Rosario, his career really took off when he joined Ray Barretto's band. Between 1966-72, Adalberto made seven albums (excluding compilations) with Ray Barretto. In late 1972, Adalberto and four other members of Barretto's band departed to found Tipica 73. He appeared on three of their albums before disagreement over musical direction led him, and three other band members, to split during the mid-70s to form Los Kimbos. Meanwhile, Santiago sang lead vocals on two critically acclaimed charanga albums, \"Fantasia Africana/African Fantasy\" and \"Our Heritage - Nuestra Herencia\", by flautist, composer and producer Lou P\u00e9rez. Los Kimbos were reputed to be a tough working band and had a sound reminiscent of both the pre-split Ray Barretto band and Tipica 73. With them, Adalberto recorded 1976's \"Los Kimbos\" and \"The Big Kimbos With Adalberto Santiago\" in1977. That year he made his solo debut on \"Adalberto\", which was produced by Ray Barretto and contained two of his own compositions. Los Kimbos continued under the leadership of timbales player Orestes Vilat\u00f3 and released two further albums- \"Hoy y Ma\u00f1ana\" (1978) and \"Aquacero Ne Me Moja\" (1979). Santiago sang lead on one track on \"Louie Ram\u00edrez y sus Amigos\" by Louie Ram\u00edrez. In 1979, Adalberto and Ram\u00edrez co-produced his solo follow-up, \"Adalberto Featuring Popeye El Marino\". The same year, he reunited with Ray Barretto on \"Rican/Struction\". Ray produced Adalberto's next solo album, \"Feliz Me Siento\", the following year. Sonora Matancera member, Javier V\u00e1zquez, produced, arranged, directed and played piano on the rootsy Adalberto Santiago, which was Adalberto's contribution to the early 80s tipico (typical) salsa revival. In 1982, he teamed up with bandleader/bongo player Roberto Roena for \"Super Apollo\" 47:50. Santiago co-produced \"Calidad\" with Papo Lucca, who also played piano, arranged one track and oversaw musical direction. His \"Cosas Del Alma\" was an album of lush boleros which included his third recorded version of the classic 'Alma Con Alma' (previously contained on Barretto's \"The Message\" and \"Gracias\"). He returned to harder-edged urban salsa in 1985 on \"Mas Sabroso\". Adalberto did his own mature version of salsa rom\u00e1ntica on the classy Sex Symbol, with production, arrangements, musical direction and piano by the ubiquitous Isidro Infante. In 1990, he again performed 'Alma Con Alma', this time arranged by Infante in a salsa rom\u00e1ntica style for Louie Ram\u00edrez's second album entitled \"Louie Ram\u00edrez y sus Amigos\". Santiago has written songs for a number of the albums on which he has appeared, both as bandleader and solo artist, and provided compositions for other artists to record, such as Joe Cuba. Adalberto has remained true to his Latin roots and a statement he made in 1977 is still relevant in the 90s: 'I want to bring a truly Latin message to the people; this is what I do best and the structure of Latin music is best suited to my singing style'.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "95-35 40th Rd, New York City, NY 11373", "Artist": "Gerardo Moran ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7487133, -73.8698326], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Sabor Latino", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Cena & Show"}, {"Address": "341 St Nicholas Ave, Ridgewood, NY 11385", "Artist": "Miguel Moly ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7006812, -73.9094303], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "El Manaba", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Ven cena y disfruta del show."}, {"Address": "546 W 207th St., New York City, NY 10034", "Artist": "Bulin 47 ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.8660197, -73.9204587], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "La Casa Del Mofongo", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "323 N Broad St, Elizabeth, NJ 07208", "Artist": "Zacarias Ferreira ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6703597, -74.2150478], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Latin, Bachata", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "XL Nightlife", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Zamora Live Presenta \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Sunday August 7 2021\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f XL Nightlife\ud83d\udccd 323 N Broad St, Elizabeth, NJ 07208\ud83c\udfa4 Zacaras Ferreira+21\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f General Admission - $50.00Doors: 8:00 pm Start: 9:00pm\ud83d\udcde 646.969.5666 // ZamoraLive.com"}, {"Address": "4210 Palisades Cte Dr A - 401, West Nyack, NY 10994", "Artist": "Aaron Weber ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11215069.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.0981032, -73.95797979999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Comedy, Stand Up Comedy", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Levity Live - West Nyack", "moreBioInfo": "Aaron is a standup comedian based in Nashville, TN.

Amassing an army of instantly recognisable hit singles, with over 13 billion global streams, over 60 million singles sales, and 5 BRIT Award nominations, Jonas has cemented his name as a main stage DJ and pop powerhouse. With over one billion streams just in 2020, joining an elite list of artists including The 1975 and Niall Horan, Jonas\u2019 debut album Blue also smashed its way to Gold status. But, with 2021 now in full swing, he\u2019s not about to rest on his laurels. A man on a mission, whose sights are firmly set for the top, this year is the start of a new era of hard graft and perseverance. His story is one of self-belief, self-improvement and talent\u2026. 2018 was a landmark year. He released \u2018Rise\u2019 featuring Jack & Jack, which was one of the summer\u2019s biggest global hits and owned the autumn with \u2018Polaroid\u2019 - his highly-anticipated collaboration with Liam Payne and Nashville actress Lennon Stella. The success of both hits was sandwiched between his huge collaboration \u2018Back & Forth\u2019 with chart-topping UK vocalist Becky Hill and Detroit house legend, MK. Debut album Blue soon followed, which featured collaborations with the likes of fast-rising songstress Nina Nesbitt, platinum-selling Canadian artist Jessie Reyez, multi-skilled singer/songwriter Zak Abel, Charlotte OC, and Grammy award-winning Puerto Rican rapper Jhay Cortez, alongside his previous multi-platinum selling hits. Jonas\u2019 album was also the recipient of the Brit Certified Breakthrough Award the following year. Off the back of Blue, Jonas\u2019 hard work and inspiring music continued to receive global success with singles featuring a combo of hot new artists, as well as household names. These included the brilliant \u2018Younger\u2019 featuring HRVY, \u2018Mistakes\u2019 featuring Paloma Faith, \u2018Naked\u2019 featuring MAX, \u2018What I Like About You\u2019 featuring Danish popstar Theresa Rex and \u2018Ritual\u2019, his much-loved collaboration with Ti\u00ebsto and Rita Ora. At the height of a hectic Ibiza season in 2019, Jonas added another string to his bow with the launch of his label, Electronic Nature. Having already established successful events, as well as releases from emerging talent including Jack Wins, Dark Heart and Jerome Price with more to come, Electronic Nature is a label to watch. Away from the studio and the charts, Jonas toured relentlessly all over the world. Clocking up the hours and miles, he\u2019s a firm fixture on festival mainstages worldwide, performing at the most legendary festivals . Not stopping there, Jonas has made his mark on Ibiza, having performed at hotspots Ushuaia, Cafe Mambo and has successfully hosted his Electronic Nature residency at superclub H\u00ef Ibiza. As we see a return to live performances, Jonas will be joining Tiesto and Zedd as a resident DJ at Zouk in Las Vegas. Locked down or not, his latest track \u2018Something Stupid\u2019 featuring AWA kicked off the year in style, holding no bars and providing joy for fans across the world.

That he did throughout the \u201970s, becoming a fixture in the Village folk and rock scenes and getting tabbed as the next big thing to come out of that long-thriving artistic community. Writing in The New York Times, the great rock critic Robert Palmer called him \u201cone of the most gifted singer-songwriters to emerge from the New York scene in years.\u201d He made his recording debut in 1980 with his acclaimed self-titled LP on Arista Records, following it a year later with Golden Down. He also opened the Who\u2019s North American tour at the personal request of the band. In 1982, he signed to Geffen Records but got caught in record-biz limbo and didn\u2019t manage to release another record until 1991, when Columbia issued Places I Have Never Been. With the EP Hard Times in America in 1992, which became a cult favorite throughout Europe, Nile finally managed to jump off the major-label hamster wheel. Gathering together his resources over time, he managed to put out his first self-released album, Beautiful Wreck of the World in 1999. In 2006, Nile released Streets of New York, which some consider to be his best work to date, due to quality production and clever songwriting.

Their sound fuses the soul and bitterness of traditional Bachata with modern production.\nThey formed in 2015 as a group of local New Yorkers who simply wanted to bond over their love of Bachata. Over time they started to record songs of their own and decided to share them with the world.\nIn 2018, they released Dime Si Volver\u00e1s, their first collaboration with Dominican Producer Neutro Evans, implementing Dub-step inspired synth sounds and pulsating kick drums. This kicked off a series of performances all around New York City, at local festivals and in residencies at local bars and clubs.\nIn 2019, they continued this partnership to then create Trap-inspired Bachata in Mi Peor Castigo. That summer, Grupo Aurora performed in the Puerto Rican Festival in Bristol, PA in addition to the monthly residency at Harlem Nights and then a Weekly Residency at Verlaine.\nIn 2020, Grupo Aurora had grown a big following in New York City because of their energetic performances but the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to it. So they released Te Alejas de M\u00ed and D\u00f3nde Estar\u00e1s featuring Jack Marcin Wisniewski, as a thank you to their supporters, the latter of which has gone on to be Grupo Aurora's most successful track to date. Grupo Aurora describes their identity and creative goal as \"Amargue Moderno\", aiming to elevate Bachata to new heights.\nLinks\nOfficial Website: www.grupoauroramusic.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/grupo-aurora-merch\nContact: https://www.grupoauroramusic.com/contact"}, {"Address": "52-19 Flushing Ave, Maspeth, NY", "Artist": "Lloydski ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7154969, -73.91412090000001], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Knockdown Center", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Tiki Disco in the Ruins of Knockdown Center"}, {"Address": "701 W 133rd St, New York, NY 10027", "Artist": "Deejay Commish ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11581150.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.8202992, -73.9589649], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Reggae, Dancehall, Soca, Dance Edm", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Creole Food Fest NYC 2021", "moreBioInfo": "The artistry of being a DJ is a rare gift.

Every mystical journey eventually comes to a fork in the road. The seeker of life\u2019s destiny has two options: remain satisfied with whatever level of consciousness he has already attained, or push forward into ever-new domains of promise and possibility. 2014 sees dance music\u2019s best-known spiritual pilgrims, the Visionquest trio of Ryan Crosson, Lee Curtiss, and Shaun Reeves, bravely embarking upon that wondrous journey. Each member of this celebrated DJing and production team contributes a distinct yet interlocking vision that together forms a seamless, organic whole. Just think of Crosson\u2019s enthusiastic shuffle, Lee\u2019s soulful stare, Shaun\u2019s soft touch. Everything they craft has the same unmistakable flair: slow-burning, shape-shifting, expansive techno and house marked by compositional elegance and unabashed pop hooks. Although long-time partner and co-conspirator Seth Troxler has stepped aside to pursue other projects, 2013 was the biggest year ever for the four. Inspired by the passing of the Mayan calendar, the group embarked upon Visionquest 13, 13 dates where the boys not only played together the whole night, but curated a true multimedia experience. From London to Buenos Aires, from the American hinterland to the Chilean wilderness, Visionquest 13 was a Freudian trip into the deepest recesses of the Detroit rave unconscious, what Ibiza Voice described as a \u201ccollective expedition into the depths of your soul\u201d\u2014but with a sophisticated, modern twist. Their accomplishments are well-known and too many to list. For starters: a critically acclaimed 2011 Fabric mix; year-defining hit remixes for artists as diverse as Kiki, Wareika, Tracey Thorn, and David Lynch; showcases and dates in the biggest clubs and festivals around the world; and the creation of a now iconic-label that\u2019s played host to dancefloor weaponry from the likes of Benoit & Sergio, Life & Death, Dinky, and Laura Jones\u2014all this while each member maintained significant individual production and DJ careers. But, by definition, no journey dwells in the past. So in 2014 they launched Visionquest Special Editions, a limited-release, vinyl only label. Evoking the experimental sounds of the European techno avant-garde that first inspired the boys back in Detroit, the debut release, remixes of Montreal songwriter Quilla, features a stunning collaboration between Shaun and long-time hero Ricardo Villalobos. With Visionquest Special Editions we see the group at home at a breezy, gentle afterparty, not just igniting the club. As Visionquest winds around the corner into their bright future, they remain open and excited for what lies ahead.

He didnt take the show to the stage until he formed a 2 man rap group in 2004 (T.S.F.P.) along side long time homie Asshole Don, the two released some of the most shocking music to this day, getting much attention in the underground music circuit. The first concert they performed was in Freedom, NY at an underground Punk Rock music festival outdoors. TSFP played the next few years around night clubs and dives in Buffalo, getting mostly Tuesday and Wednesday night bookings starting at 11pm or later. The ability to draw small crowds of 50-100 people consistently on weeknights opened more doors of opportunity and led to better gigs, being offered weekend shows. In 2007 Personal issues led Asshole Don to depart from the group leaving Flatline to return to a solo career in music as he broadened and experimented with his sound, producing and mastering his craft over the next several years. In 2007 Flatline took 2nd place at Battle of the Bands held at Showplace Theater being the only rap act on the entire bill. In 2009 Flatline played nearly every weekend in WNY, playing 46 shows in 52 weeks, some back to back nights playing Buffalo Friday then Niagara Falls or Rochester the following night. Mid year he signed a 15 show booking contract with DTD Entertainment which then led to a meeting with ATA Management. Flatline signed a one year contract with ATA in September of 2009. The contract prohibited Flatline from continuing to book and perform shows which were not presented by the firm beyond his already booked schedule. The contract and agreement sat stagnant as did Flatlines career as he waited for bookings and record negotiations that never came. In 2010 Flatline brought together a super show to the local music scene called The Spook Show which would be held for the next year into 2011 the last Thursday of every month at Club Diablo in Downtown Buffalo, NY. The show held a wide variety of entertainment from live music, horror films, magic, comedy, burlesque, and even hardcore wrestling. Flatline still being under contract prevented him from booking his own concerts to play Live music, so Flatline found a loop hole as he Hosted the Spook Show and was strictly involved in the nightly BarFight / DeathMatches which were a part of the show experience. August 2010 Flatline formed Kamp Crystal Lake when he was asked to collaborate by new coming rapper who Flatline had booked on 2 previous Spook Shows. As he waited for his contract to expire with ATA, he set the plans in motion to make a huge impact returning to the stage and he did just that. The first concert Flatline would return was an event he put together for the upcoming release of \"Rotten Flesh\" Mind Possessing Instrumentals album. It was a Zombie Walk / After Party that took place in downtown Buffalo for his Birthday celebrating the end of his contractual ties and his return to the stage. He split his set performing track for track back and forth as the newly formed Kamp Crystal Lake. Flatline started booking the band and landed a few dates on Hopsin's I Am Raw Tour in spring of 2011. KCL would then go on to release an album on Friday the 13th of May, 2011 and spend the next few years playing dives to top concert halls opening for many tours that came to Buffalo. On Halloween Night, 2011 Flatline launched a concept which would then lead to the beginning of Reel Horror Records a label which he would help give some other local 716 acts a platform to gain exposure and release music to a wider spread audience. Summer of 2013 KCL took home an award from the WNY Music Awards for Rap act \"Performance of the Year\". On September 13th, 2013 Flatline resurrected the Spook Show in Downtown Buffalo, NY at the newly opened Waiting Room. The show was a 7 hour jam packed variety show event keeping true to the original Thursday Night Spook Show which he held years earlier at Club Diablo. The show drew hundreds of local fans as they lined up before doors would open and stayed till wee hours of the night to witness this truly amazing event for the local scene. The night also dated the release of the 2nd full length album release from KCL, which was released for free to the public via KampCrystalLake.com Aside from the music, Flatline has written and self published a comic book, directed multiple music videos and short films, acted in movie roles for Troma, and JFR Productions, is a published poet, DJ, Radio Host of The Eulogy on Think Twice Radio, Graphic Designer, and is also a Professional Wrestler, getting his start in 1996 on the underground circuit then training in Toronto, Canada and touring the Northeast in the early to mid 2000's.

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes.

The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.\u201d \u2018Forever Just Beyond,\u2019 Barzelay\u2019s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett\u2019s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay\u2019s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery. \u201cI look up to Eef with total respect and admiration,\u201d says Avett, \u201cand I hope to survive like he survives: with total love for the new and the unknown.

Borroughs character, Clem Snide first emerged from Boston as a three-piece in the early 1990\u2019s, and the group would go on to become a cult and critical favorite, picking up high profile fans from Bon Iver to Ben Folds over the course of three decades and more than a dozen studio albums.

The duo has fronted many bands spanning a wide variety of genres but for the first time, with Plane Station, are settling into the music they feel most at home with. Honing their craft through years of live performance, Nick and Brianna build their sound on an ability to write collaboratively and harmonize with one another that is, at this point, second nature. Their first album, The Other Side, finds the duo exploring themes of love, change and loss in a stripped down, predominantly acoustic setting. However, Plane Station is not averse to the grandiose and often stretch their acoustic sound into soaring harmonies and swelling instrumentation. This is evident not only in their sprawling live shows, which often feature drummer and producer Jesse Melito, but their two latest singles, Alcohol and Francis.

Formed in the mid 1990s, the band soon became a highly acclaimed musical force on the East Coast underground Jazz and Jam Band scene. This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years. Cipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic. Cipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world. After being a student at the UCB theatre for over two years, Cipha now has a weekly sold out \u201cTake It Personal: Hip Hop Improv Show, where a different Hip Hop celebrity tells a true life story and Cipha & his team of improvisers perform a complete live comedy show based on those stories.

Their new creation, \u201dRecurrence\u201d, is a concept album focusing on the cyclic nature of humanity, while highlighting both the technical- and melodic aspects familliar to the progressive metal genre. With \u201dRecurrence\u201d the band focused on making an album that would be more than just the sum of it\u2019s tracks, and therefore envisioned an album where the songs would float into each other, and at the very end connect with the beginning of the first song, making an \u201dinfinite\u201d album; thus mirroring the lyrics. The major theme of the album, lyrically, more or less presented itself; the cyclic nature of humanity. Within that theme the lyrics explore and challenge topics like dementia, whether the world might be a better place without what humanity has become, and what is left behind when we\u2019re gone. As always the band wanted to challenge themselves technically, always trying do better than the last time. But always keeping the songs and the album as a whole in focus. The result is an album comprising six tracks, varying in length from 5 to 22 minutes per track, at times, but certainly not always; in the tradition of bands like Circus Maximus, Threshold, Arena, Haken, early Dream Theater and Pagan\u2019s Mind. Vicinity started the recording of \u201dRecurrence\u201d in november 2015, at Skarp Studio (Keep of Kalessin, Triosphere, Tellus Requiem), where they tracked the drums. The following months would be spent recording bass, guitars and keyboards at Vicinity\u2019s own recording facilites, once again selfproducing the album. Alexander K. Lykke would then record the vocals at Tagline\u2019s recording facilities in Trondheim. Mixing duties was handed to Christer-Andr\u00e9 Cederberg, who had previously mixed both Circus Maximus and Anathema, aiming for- and ending up with a more organic sounding mix than was the case with \u201dAwakening\u201d. Mastering was once again handled by Jens Bogren (Symphony X, James Labrie, Opeth, Haken, Headspace and many more). Vicinity is the musical melting pot of band members Alexander K. Lykke (vocals), Kim-Marius H. Olsen (guitars), Pierre-Nicolai H. Schmidt-Melbye (bass) and Ivar A. Nyland (keyboards). The band draws inspiration from all the kinds of music the band members enjoy listening to, be it classic- or modern prog, rock, pop, classical music, heavy metal or more extreme stuff. Once the musical ideas have been filtered through the band it all comes out sonding like Vicinity anyways, no matter who came up with the inital idea. Following the release of \u201dAwakening\u201d the band played several gigs in Norway, sharing the stage with bands like Withem, Tritonus, Mindtech, Rudhira and Fuel for Disaster.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}]
