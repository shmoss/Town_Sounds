The record showcases the versatility of her smooth, buttery vocals and the well-crafted songs ranging from the soulful and sultry \"Little Bird,\" to the fun, romantic single, \"Cherry Tree\" which makes the listener feel like they are on a stroll through Central Park on a Saturday afternoon. In the brief time leading up to the EP release, this social worker-turned-songwriter has gained a solid fan-base by performed at some of New York\u2019s most famous music venues including The Bitter End, Rockwood Music Hall and Pianos.

Back in the late 00s, Britt Reagan (guitar), Tim Hassler (fiddle), Titus Tompkins (drums/percussion), and Ben Quinn (mandolin) began playing music together at the University of Evansville in Indiana. As theater students, they often collaborated to score plays with music. Through these experiences, they quickly learned that their tastes, talents, and friendship formed a four-part harmony and they began writing their own material, culminating in an early collection of songs, \u201cRise and Shiner\u201d. After graduating, the group dispersed across the country, before reuniting in NYC. In NYC, the group started busking all over the city, in parks and on subway platforms. Gigs soon followed and Mark Spitznagel (Rusty Guns) joined the band, bringing his virtuosic banjo style, which complemented the band\u2019s increasingly traditional repertoire. Highlighting their love of old time and bluegrass, as well as their raucous busking personality, the band paired up with Erik Samuelson (Three Crown Studio) to release their first 7-song EP, \u201cThe Good Morning Nags\u201d. The band grew once more when Pete O\u2019Neill (Mama Juke, CC & The Boys, and more) brought his dynamic bass lines and rhythmic genius into the mix.

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time. Spawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads. Early on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d The band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums. A career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "45 Main St, Stanhope, NJ 07874", "Artist": "King Solomon Hicks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10187836.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.902576, -74.7080551], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Stanhope House ", "moreBioInfo": "\"King\" Solomon Hicks is an American blues guitarist born in Harlem, NY.

In only a short time, she has already taken NYC by storm performing across major club venues & building a strong foundation within the club circuits. Her early experiences in the New York City Ballet\u2019s \u2018The Nutcracker\u2019 at 7 years old proved an instant love & attraction with music & performance. Becoming a self-taught drummer watching and learning from YouTube tutorial videos by the age of 10, Callie three years later enrolled in acclaimed NYC electronic music production & DJ School Dubspot, having her first lesson mixing vinyl under the guidance of JP Solis. All while moving forward in her modeling career with NEXT models, gaining global profile with aligned brands such as H&M, American Eagle, Converse & Beats by Dr. Dre, as well as editorial spreads for Vogue, Milk & Teen Vogue. Having reached almost one million streams on Spotify, Callie\u2019s thrilling debut release \u201cTin Machine\u201d via NEST HQ in 2016 displayed a trendsetting talent within the electronic soundscape. Just a couple months later, she returned to the limelight with her inaugural EP \u2018Shadow Dancing\u2019 through A-Trak\u2019s Brooklyn-based Fool\u2019s Gold Records, including her original title track & a jaw-breaking collaboration with KANDY. The following year she cemented her ability in crafting bass-backed beats & laser-beaming riffs, with her 2017 self-released single \u201cStimulate\u201d. Chiming in elements of live electronica, drumbeat, & ethereal sound design, Callie is a production powerhouse in the making.

The concept of Vini Vici was formed by the boys with an intention to express their love for the old school sound, paired with their progressive ideas. Iboga Records and FM Bookings, widely considered to be the biggest psytrance label and booking agency, were the first to see the potential of the project and invited them to be part of their well respected family, alongside names such as: Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Ticon, Captain Hook, Atmos, and the like. After the huge success of their premier EP 'Divine Mode' and their follow-up \u2018Back Underground\u2019, \u2018Expender\u2019, \u2018Anything & Everything\u2019, and \u2018Veni Vidi Vici\u2019 tracks (all top sellers on Beatport and Iboga Records charts), Vini Vici continued to produce massive hits while touring the world nonstop - Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, Finland, France, India, Denmark, Germany, United State, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Serbia, Netherland, Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel\u2026.. It's no surprise Beatport positioned them at No.3 on the Top Artist list of 2014. 2015 was a huge step forward for the boys with the release of their debut album \u2018Vini Vici - Future Classics\u2019. They hit the Beatport Main Chart at No.2 (Psytrance at No.1) - a position that very few psytrance artists have managed to stand at before, followed by Psyshop No.1 and TrackItDown No.1 spots, while the legendary Infected Mushroom named them \u201cthe best upcoming psytrance artists at the moment\u201d. The explosion continued when trance king Armin Van Buuren edited their already classic tune \u2018The Tribe\u2019, and featured them on his legendary \u2018ASOT\u2019 radio show over and over again. Finishing 2015 with a bang, the boys were ranked by Beatport as No.1 on the PsyTrance Artist chart and they also landed the Best Selling Track of 2015. They continued to make history early in 2016 with their Vini Vici Remix of \u2018Hilight Tribe - Free Tibet\u2019 - the track gained over 15,000,000 views on YouTube and 5,000,000 plays on Soundcloud, while also hitting the No.2 spot on Beatport\u2019s Main chart, and becoming the first psytrance track ever to have entered the Beatport Main Top 10. After such an outstanding beginning to 2016, it\u2019s no surprise that the rest of their year continued to bring this elevated level and even after many successful years before became their best year by far. Some even call it the \u2018The Vini Vici Year\u2019 - with over 220 shows in some of the most prestigious electronic music events around the globe (A State Of Trance Festival NL, Tomorrowland BE, Boom Festival PT, Electric Daisy Carnival in U.S.A, Ultra BR, Dreamstate U.S.A, Transmission CZ, Experience BR, Vuuv DE, Sunburn GOA, Luminosity NL, Earthcore AU, Unity IL just to name a few\u2026). Keeping their No.1 spot on Beatport\u2019s Psytrance Artist list and Best Selling Track for the second year in a row went on to lead a new generation of psytrance fans and producers to their style. Just before ending off 2016 came the jewel in the crown; a collaboration with no other than one of the solid founders of modern electronic music - Armin Van Buuren, featuring french band Hilight Tribe in their creation \u2018Great Spirit\u2019. This massive collaboration took over the Beatport Main Chart immediately and gained over 1,000,000 views on YouTube in just 2 weeks, taking them one step closer to their life goal of spreading psytrance culture and energy in the world.

That premier album was strongly influenced by many 4AD acts, brought into sharp focus by the mixing of This Mortal Coil\u2019s John Fryer (Lush, NIN, Depeche Mode) and featuring artwork by 4ADs legendary designer, V23's Vaughan Oliver (Pixies, Bauhaus), which further enhanced their strong aesthetic connections to that label. The band maintains a distinctive ethos--embracing their idols, while still forging their own sound. Their second LP, Beyond Desire, coming October 13th via Papercup Music finds them working with legendary My Bloody Valentine engineer Guy Fixsen (MBV, WIRE) and Jorge Elbreht (Ariel Pink, No Joy, Frankie Rose, Violens, Lansing-Drieden) with artwork from Timothy O\u2019Donnell (another 4AD design alumni) at Mexican Summer's Gary's Electric studio in Greenpoint. The new record finds them exploring something much more than bands within their sphere typically strive for - it's introspection leavened with human connectedness and higher arching themes of maturation and growth that transcend the basic needs of lust and want. This record comes far closer to approximating their live show, with a scorching sound that is often volatile, rife with damaged guitar deconstructions and gleaming figures, yet maintains their eminently melodic sensibilities. Beyond Desire, shifts from shimmering to scorching at the drop of a hat held together by rock solid songwriting. By moving between both ends of the spectrum, the ten tracks on Beyond Desire function both as blissed-out, resplendent expository narratives, and also as pure, white-noise nihilism. Both their live performances and album, replete with gorgeous packaging and artwork, are crucial entry points to understanding the band. Their upcoming tour will take them across the country from New Orleans to California playing in old and new cities alike over the course of three months. DLE has done multiple national tours over the past three years resulting in over 200 shows and taking them to SXSW, CMJ, NXNE, Northside Festival and everywhere in between. Previous tours and SXSW bills included Swervedriver, A Place to Bury Strangers, The Ocean Blue, The Warlocks, Modern English, The Wedding Present & Trail Of the Dead. They're also veterans of the Desert Stars festival, sharing a bill with the Lemonheads and opening for Lou Barlow in the Joshua Tree desert in 2016. They've toured the East with Slumberland bands Weekend and Lorelei, and on the West Coast with Beach Fossils and the Telescopes at The Echo. They played a festival in 2011 with the Psychedelic Furs as well as sold out shows in 2010 opening for the then recently reunited Chapterhouse and Ulrich Schnauss. They\u2019ve constantly topped the CMJ Top 20 indie charts, have played twice live on the venerable KEXP's John in the Morning, and were recently featured as song of the day, while simultaniously on regular rotation on KEXP, and have also been featured on Nic Harcourt's KCSN show Morning Becomes Electric. \"DLE bring you Dream-Pop!\" -FILTER Magazine \"Some of the best live music in the city\" -Time Out NY \"Brooklyn\u2019s Dead Leaf Echo play guitar-pop in the mold of Primal Scream and Swervedriver.\" - Death and Taxes \"We love Dead Leaf Echo's dreamy pop\" -The L Magazine", "otherInfo": "Free Outdoor Show"}, {"Address": "151 Brookdale Rd, Stamford, CT 06903", "Artist": "Abbie Gardner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11175463.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.1329661, -73.5523501], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Blues, Acoustic", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Abbie Gardner Outdoor Concert", "moreBioInfo": "Abbie Gardner is a fiery dobro player with an infectious smile.

For New Jersey singer/songwriter Tara Dente, that duo of traits is on full display on the new album called Truth In The Mud. Grounded in a kind of rootsy Americana, it\u2019s only after letting each song bloom that one begins to hear all of Dente\u2019s varied influences. From her early years surrounded by the sound of Celtic and church hymns, to her self-guided tour through American vernacular music, you hear solid fingerpicking, storytelling, and a voice that always offers comfort. And from influences as diverse as Nick Drake and Enya, you hear a focus on not just songcraft, but soundcraft - using words and music seamlessly to create a cohesive whole. Since stepping into Asbury Park\u2019s music scene back in 2012, Dente\u2019s reputation has been steadily building, buoyed by her standout 2014 debut called Leave Your Ghosts Behind as well as 2017\u2019s The Gleaner, released worldwide on Travianna Records. With Truth In The Mud, Dente has made her most compelling artistic statement yet. This is the work of an artist in complete command, but still vulnerable to the kind of self-doubt that makes her feel approachable and welcoming. There\u2019s comfort in her songs, because Tara Dente knows what to say - and how to say it - at exactly the right time. Never is that more accurate than on \u2018Hill So Steep,\u2019 the new album\u2019s leadoff track. Despite being written well before 2020\u2019s unprecedented disruption to artistic life, Dente tackles the classic Sisyphean predicament that has become all too familiar for artists living and working in our current environment. As she explains, \u201c\u2019Hill So Steep\u2019 is about a dream I had. In the dream, I was driving up a hill so steep, I felt like I was climbing the steepest roller coaster with no belt on or bar to hold me in and would just fall out. The dream certainly reflected difficult circumstances happening in my life at the time. I was a server at a popular restaurant in my town and did pretty well in tips that day. As soon as I turned the corner walking to my car after work, I noticed it, as well as a slew of other cars, had been towed. The dollar amount it took to get my car back from the auto shop was the exact amount I had made that day in tips. That night, I had the dream. Sometimes you take a step forward, and then take a step right back. But then another day, you'll take three steps forward. You just have to hang in there the best you can and look for the next right thing.\" Truth In The Mud is a giant step forward. And there are many more to come. This is no longer an artist on her way.

Already devoted to turntables, he heard something different in those tracks, and he \u201cwent for the difference. I never got a break in New York, but England happened right away, so I catered to them.\u201d In any event, the Todd Terry sound was born. By 1988, Todd Terry hit big in England and Europe, and his notoriety was making its way back to the U.S. In addition to DJ appearances, Todd was cutting his classic underground tracks A Day In The Life, Weekend, and Can You Party, released under monikers such as the Todd Terry Project, House Of Gypsies, and Royal House, all considered essential and ground breaking. In the mid 90\u2019s, the Ministry of Sound\u2019s eponymous UK label released A Day In The Life, a collection of Todd Terry tracks that had been causing dance floor panic. That then led the way to a deal with Mercury Records allowing him to set up a context in which to work with his favourite singers and performers. The first release, Keep On Jumpin\u2019 on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash. Todd followed with the anthem \u2018Somethin Going On\u2019, a top 5 UK crossover pop hit. All the while, Todd continued to break new ground as a Producer/Remixer. From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd\u2019s mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others. He also produced a Robin S track (Givin\u2019 You All That I\u2019ve Got) for the multi-platinum Space Jam soundtrack. Todd is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated figures in dance music.

He\u2019s a natural storyteller, balancing the exuberant with the poignant, and able to distill universal truth out of his often romantic, drawn-from-life tales. Cohn followed up his platinum-selling debut with two more releases in the 1990s, at which point TIME magazine called him \"one of the honest, emotional voices we need in this decade\" and Bonnie Raitt declared, \"Marc is one of the most soulful, talented artists I know. I love his songs, he's an incredible singer, and I marvel at his ability to mesmerize every audience he plays for.\" Raitt, James Taylor, David Crosby, Graham Nash and Patty Griffin all made guest appearances on Cohn\u2019s early records for Atlanta, as his reputation as an artist and performer continued to grow. In 1998, Cohn took a decade-long sabbatical from recording, ending in 2007 with Join the Parade. Inspired by the horrific events following Hurricane Katrina and his own near fatal shooting just weeks before, Parade is his most moving and critically acclaimed record to date.

The band has also relocated to Brooklyn, NY and toured widely, sharing stages with Sierra Hull and the California Honeydrops and appearing at festivals like Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, and Freshgrass Festival, where they took second place in the 2016 band competition. Their lyrics find beauty and glory in the mundane, workaday struggle of everyday life: time keeps passing, you don\u2019t like your job, you drink too much, you laugh with your friends, you search for a home, and you dream about what else might be out there. You carry on. This is what Damn Tall Buildings sings about, what they seek to share with their audience.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Gawain ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7219949, -73.9883827], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Gawain and The Green Knight"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Luke Sellick ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7803834.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223225, -73.98858129999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Luke Sellick and Andrew Renfroe"}, {"Address": "200 Middlesex Ave, Carteret, NJ 07008", "Artist": "Kimon & the Prophets ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11488325.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.5718168, -74.2167222], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Funk, Reggae, Rock, Jam Rock, Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Concerts by the Bay", "moreBioInfo": "Whether raising eyebrows with superbly crafted original songs, exploding the hits of Stevie Wonder or Sting into ultimate groove tunes, or funkin\u2019 up a Stevie Ray Vaughn blues jam, anything is possible with the Prophets' vast library of songs.

SONI withanEYE is emerging with a genre expanding collection of music that will attract listeners from house lovers to head bangers with her self-described \u201cHip Rock with a touch of Funk'n Soul.\u201d As she put the finishing touches on her debut album featuring Mobb Deep and Quest Love of The Roots to name a few, SONI withanEYE delivered a taste of what is about to come in the video for her forthcoming single \u201cGet It Together\u201d featuring the legendary Raekwon, from the Wu Tang Clan and her new video for her new single \"Rebel\" featuring cameos from Natalie of Nina Sky and video vixen Gloria Velez bringing a strong message of women empowerment through visual art and song. Born and bred in Queens, New York, Soni Guzman, known as SONI withanEYE, honed her skills in church while singing in the choir during her time at Catholic school. But it wasn\u2019t until she began playing with instruments such as the piano and guitar, which proved she had an innate talent to sing and perform. She expanded her talents of how to work a crowd even more, when added spinning records to her repartee. While continuing to live in New York and traveling the world, SONIcontinuously finds inspirations in so many sounds and cultures, which are magically reflected in her unique music. While her Puerto Rican roots are showcased in some of her past catalog of music, it\u2019s the present work she\u2019s creating that speaks to her musicianship across a myriad of genres. She credits an array of artists from David Bowie to Dolly Parton, from Madonna to Dinah Washington, and from Ray Barreto to Led Zeppelin for her eclectic love of music. \u201cI would love for my music to create emotion, joy, consciousness, compassion and influence people,\u201d SONI states, \u201cThere are many different emotions and a strong personality I project through my music, that's influenced by my experiences, friends and family, as well as the different genres I've been exposed to growing up.\u201d Inspired by her father, who played everything from the congas to saxophone, and even managed the Brooklyn Breakers, SONI withanEYE moves in the same direction by not being able to be pigeonholed into one specific genre. Although SONI withanEYE has recorded with the likes of Timberland and The Beatnuts, SONI may be predominately known for her past collaborations with Todd Terry, Tony Touch, Louie Vega and working with the legendary Jelly Bean Benitez, but her debut album will be fully decorated with flavors of Hip-Hop, House, Rock-n-Roll and R&B. While some may try to throw labels on what her music represents, Soni serves as a musical teacher of sorts, defining what she truly is: a versatile force with a voice that touches the soul with tracks like \"Here to Stay\" released by Vega Records, \u201cSilly Girl\u201d featuring Questlove of The Roots and single/video featuring Raekwon \u201cGet It Together\u201d attest to that. SONI withanEYE currently serves as the face of Cypress Hills\u2019 BReal.tv where she hosts the weekly live broadcasted \"Toca Tuesday\" during which she interviews her fellow artists and party goers as she showcases her cunning on-camera charm. SONI has also created her own Brunch Event Series called \u201cLet\u2019s Play KETCHUP\u201d and \u201cExtra Sauce\u00e8\u201d that celebrates the love for food and music.

He is known as a great jazz, latin and classical pianist with superb technical ability, and has played and recorded with many world-famous musicians. Michel lists some of his main influences as Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and Art Tatum. Michel was born into a musical family and as a young child showed great aptitude for the accordion that his parents gave him. Although he enjoyed the accordion, it was his grandparents' piano that sparked his interest the most, so at aged 9 he asked his parents to buy him one. Their response was to first send him to the Elementary Music School, part of the National Conservatory, and then a year later to grant his wish. The formal system of the music school taught Michel to play in the classical style, and by aged 16 he was playing with the National Symphony Orchestra of the Dominican Republic. Michel comments on his first encounter with the sounds of jazz, in an interview with the All About Jazz website: \u201dThe first time I heard jazz was when I was 14 and a half. I heard the great Art Tatum on the radio playing his solo piano rendition of 'Tea for Two.' That immediately caught my ear. I just wanted to soak it in, to learn to play that style. Then I found out it was jazz.\u201d Michel studied for 13 years at the National Conservatory, and whilst developing his strong classical abilities was also heavily influenced by the bop tradition, and by the contemporary jazz of Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. His influences at this time also included Horace Silver, Erroll Garner, and the ragtime music of Scott Joplin. When the Harvard University Jazz Band visited the Dominican Republic and heard Michel at a jam session, the bandleader encouraged him, 'You should be in the States', and so the idea was planted. In 1979 Michel moved to New York to study at Mannes College and at The Juilliard School, and broke onto the international stage in 1983 when Tito Puente's pianist was unable to make a concert at the Montreal Jazz Festival. On a recommendation, without hearing him, Tito asked Michel to play. Cuban reedman Paquito D'Rivera was in the audience, and immediately offered him a place in his band. For four years Michel toured internationally with Paquito, and recorded two albums with him. Michel's emergence as a star in his own right began around 1985, the year he debuted with his trio at Carnegie Hall. In that same year he toured Europe with Paquito D\u2019Rivera\u2019s quintet, and recorded his first album, Why Not?, for Japan\u2019s King label. In 1988 Michel debuted on a major record label, Sony, with the release of Michel Camilo. This became a bestseller and held the top jazz album spot for ten consecutive weeks. Other bestselling albums followed and so did the accolades, including a Grammy and an Emmy. Michel's collaborative 2000 album with flamenco guitarist Tomatito, Spain won Best Latin Jazz Album in the first Latin Grammy Awards. As well as being an outstanding performer, Michel is a talented composer and has written scores for several Spanish language films including Los Peores A\u00f1os de Nuestra Vida and the award-winning Amo Tu Cama Rica. Michel tours extensively, and lectures in Europe, the US and in the Puerto Rico Conservatory. He holds several honorary degrees, a Visiting Professorship at Berklee College of Music, and has been honored in his home country by being named a Knight of the Heraldic Order of Christopher Columbus, and being awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez & Mella.

Dion Francis DiMucci (b July 18, 1939), better known as Dion, is an American singer-songwriter, now widely recognized as one of the top singers of his era, blending the best elements of doo-wop, pop, and R&B styles. Early years Dion was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx borough of New York City. As a child, he used to accompany his father, a vaudeville entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of country music \u2013 particularly Hank Williams \u2013 and the blues and doo-wop stars he heard in local bars and on the radio. His singing abilities were honed on the street corners of Crotona Avenue, where he rounded up other local singers inventing acapella licks, and in local clubs. In early 1957 he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz, who had just formed Mohawk Records. They recorded him with a vocal group, The Timberlanes, and released a single \"The Chosen Few\", arranged by Hugo Montenegro, which became a minor regional hit. With the Belmonts, 1957-1960 Schwartz also signed up Dion's friends, The Belmonts, named after nearby Belmont Avenue. Their breakthrough together came in early 1958, when \"I Wonder Why\" made # 22 on the national US charts, followed up with \"No One Knows\" and \"Don\u2019t Pity Me\" which were also chart hits. This success won Dion and the Belmonts a place on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. On 2 February 1959, after playing at Clear Lake, Iowa, Dion decided that he could not afford the $36 cost of a flight to the next venue [1]. The plane crashed, and Holly and the other stars were killed. In March 1959, Dion and the Belmonts\u2019 next single, \"A Teenager In Love\", was released, making # 5 in the US pop charts and # 28 in the UK. Their biggest hit, \"Where or When\", was released in November 1959, and reached #3 on the US charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked in to hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful, there were musical and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960 Dion decided to quit for a solo career. Solo stardom, 1960-1964 1961 album coverBy the end of 1960, Dion had recorded and released his first solo album, Alone With Dion, and the single \"Lonely Teenager\", which rose to # 12 in the US charts. Follow-ups \"Havin\u2019 Fun\" and \"Kissin\u2019 Game\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with new vocal group the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \"Runaround Sue\", stormed up the charts, reaching # 1 in the US charts in September 1961, and # 11 in the UK, where he also toured. For the next single, the record company promoted the A-side, \"The Majestic\", but it was the B-side, Maresca\u2019s song \"The Wanderer\", which received the radio plays and again rose swiftly up the charts, reaching # 2 in the US charts in December 1961 and # 10 in the UK. As a classic oldie, it made the UK top twenty again in 1976. By the end of 1961, Dion was a major star, with a worldwide touring schedule, and he followed up with a string of hit singles \u2013 \"Lovers Who Wander\" (# 3), \"Little Diane\" (# 8), \"Love Came To Me\" (# 10) and \"Ruby Baby\" (# 2) all making the top ten in 1962. Several of these were written or co-written by Dion. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander. At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records, the first rock and roll artist ever signed to that label. Although the first single, Leiber and Stoller\u2019s \"Ruby Baby\", was a big hit, reaching # 2, several follow-ups were less so, although \"Donna the Prima Donna\" and \"Drip Drop\" both reached # 6 in the charts in late 1963. Nevertheless, problems with his addiction and changing public tastes did cause him to enter a period of commercial decline. Changing fortunes, 1964-1968 Following a European tour, Dion returned to the USA and was introduced to classic blues music by Columbia\u2019s John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon\u2019s \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"Spoonful\", but these releases \u2013 some produced by Tom Wilson, with Al Kooper on keyboards - were not commercially successful. In 1966, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts for the album Together Again on ABC Records. Again, this bombed, despite one classic self-penned song, \"My Girl The Month Of May\". Although by this stage Dion\u2019s career appeared to be nearing an end, he retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, the only pop artist featured on the album cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. In April 1968, Dion had a powerful religious experience. After getting clean from drug use, he approached Laurie Records for a new contract, and they agreed on condition that he record the song \"Abraham, Martin and John\", written by Dick Holler (also the writer of The Royal Guardsmen\u2019s \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\") in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy during the summer of 1968. The success of this song \u2013 later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye \u2013 which reached # 4 in the US charts, resuscitated Dion\u2019s career. The mature period, 1968-1986 Born To Be With You, 1975For the next few years, Dion\u2019s music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to critical acclaim but moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969. There followed a one-off live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden in 1972, released on album. This was followed in 1975 by the album Born To Be With You, eccentrically produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who. In 1978 Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, Return of the Wanderer, another critical success and commercial failure. In December 1979 he experienced a life-changing religious experience, documented in this article [1]. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian music vein, in which he released a number of albums on the Dayspring label reflecting his religious convictions. Recent work In 1987 Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. This helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences. In 1988 Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled The Wanderer: Dion's Story was published. In the following year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the induction speech being given by Lou Reed. In 1989 he returned to secular rock music with the album Yo Frankie, and since then has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His D\u00e9j\u00e0 Nu album in 2000 found him covering Bruce Springsteen, a major follower over the years. He joined Scott Kempner of the Del-Lords and Mike Mesaros of The Smithereens in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted. In January 2006 he released Bronx in Blue, an album of blues and country standards, which was critically acclaimed and nominated for a Grammy. As a practicing Catholic, Dion pursues prison ministry and reaches out to men going through addiction recovery.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "702 Union St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "DADDY ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8370472.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6760416, -73.98013329999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "R&b/soul, Blues, Folk, Soul, Americana, Rock, Rnb-soul", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Union Hall", "moreBioInfo": "DADDY (Will Kimbrough & Tommy Womack) Will Kimbrough and Tommy Womack both boast amazing underground resumes. Kimbrough (2005 Americana Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year) and Womack (Two-time winner of the Nashville Scene Best Song Award) first came together in 1992 in the bis-quits, who made one impressive guitar-fest record for John Prine\u2019s Oh-Boy! label. They discovered a musical and personal kinship that they fought for years \u2013 in and amongst other commitments \u2013 to get back to. With the breakup of the bis-quits in 1994, Kimbrough went on to be lead guitarist in Todd Snider & the Nervous Wrecks.

Womack wrote Cheese Chronicles: The True Story of a Rock n\u2019 Roll Band You\u2019ve Never Heard Of (the story of his first band, Government Cheese. Kimbrough went on from Todd Snider\u2019s band to play with Rodney Crowell (most recently) as well as with Kim Richey, Josh Rouse and others, and to become one of the most in-demand session guitarists in Nashville, launching a successful solo career as well and getting songs cut by Jimmy Buffett, Jack Ingram and Little Feat. Womack wrote songs with Jason & the Scorchers and Dan Baird, and has been covered by Todd Snider, Scott Kempner and David Olney, among others. Drawing on Juke-Joint Blues, Country and good old Heavy Rock, DADDY (as they chose to call their new band) made its debut many years later, in 2005, with the \u201cAt The Women\u2019s Club\u201d album, recorded live in Frankfort, Kentucky.

The studs n\u2019 leather bedecked TRANSMETAL, founded during January 1987, have stuck to their Thrash / Speed Metal stance over nearly twenty Spanish language albums. Upon their formation TRANSMETAL was fronted by vocalist Alberto Pimentel, who featured on the 1988 debut \u2018Muerto en la Cruz\u2019, produced by Dark Angel\u2019s Eric Meyer, and the follow up \u2018Desear Un Funeral\u2019. On June 18th 1989 the group opened for Death at the Naucalpan Arena Lopez Mateos. In 1990 Pimentel departed to found LEPROSSY. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez of ILLUSION, and subsequently frontman for Arkhe, would fill the vacancy before Juan Carlos Camarena took the role of second guitarist. The band featured on the high profile \u2018New Titans Over Mexico\u2019 tour of 1991, these shows sharing billing with Sacred Reich in January, Kreator in July and Sepultura in December. On May 3rd 1992 TRANSMETAL supported Overkill at the Arena A. Lopez Mateos in Tlanepantla then appeared as part of the \u2018Mexican Mosh\u2019 festival alongside Sick of It All, Deicide and Nuclear Assault. The album that year, 'Amanecer En El Mausoleu', featured a cover version of 'Killers' by French band Killers. On November 8th the band scored the high profile support to Black Sabbath's concert at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City. 1992 witnessed the departure of these latest two recruits and Alberto Pimental resumed activities with the band on a stand in basis. A successful Mexican tour during October found TRANSMETAL headlining over Mortuary and Inquisidor. The band's status would engender a further slot at the March 1993 \u2018Mexican Mosh\u2019 festival event, this time sharing honours with OVERKILL, KREATOR and Monstrosity among others. The following year TRANSMETAL, together with fellow native acts Angeles del Infierno and Rata Blanca, represented Mexico at the June 1994 \u2018Monstruos De Rock\u2019 gathering in Spain. The group notably guested for Slayer on September 10th at the Mexico City Balneario Olimpico. Pimentel would opt out yet again to forge another version of Leprosy (spelt with one \u2018S\u2019 on this ocassion) assembling a new band including Ramses guitarist Julio Marquez and ex-INQUISIDOR drummer Felipe Chacon. TRANSMETAL took onboard the esteemed former Luzbel and Huizar frontman Arturo Huizar as their lead vocalist but by February 1998 two members of Panic, vocalist Mauricio Torres and guitarist \u2018Eric Towers\u2019 (a.k.a. Ernesto Torres) stabilised the band for the album 'Las Alas Del Emperador'. Meantime, Lorenzo Partida and ex-TRANSMETAL vocalist Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez would create the side project Ultratumba. TRANSMETAL's show at the Adolph Lopez Mateos de Tlalnepantla Arena in Mexico City in July 1999 was filmed and recorded, subsequently put out as two live discs 'dubbed XIII A\u00f1os... En Vivo - Primera Parte' and 'XIII A\u00f1os... En Vivo - Segunda Parte'. TRANSMETAL took a novel approach of recording tracks for two albums at once, 'Tristeza De Lucifer' and 'De Bajo De Los Cielos P\u00farpura', these sessions held in Hammond, Indiana with producer Mike Sheffield. Upon the release of 'Tristeza De Lucifer' the group toured South America during 2001. Shows in Bogota, Colombia, Manizales and Cal\u00ed in Colombia, River basin in Ecuador, Arequipa in Peru, La Paz and Santa Cruz in Bolivia would prove a first for a Mexican Metal band. 'De Bajo De Los Cielos P\u00farpura' then arrived in July 2000, prompting a 30 date run of shows across the USA. That same year the debut album 'Muerto En La Cruz' would see a CD re-issue, adding four extra tracks. The band's legacy would be honoured in 2001 with the delivery of no less than two tribute albums in 'Milicia Infernal... Tributo a Transmetal' and the live 'Milicia Infernal... Tributo A Transmetal (En Vivo)', both released on the Denver label. Those paying homage included LUZBEL, PANIC, Disgorge, Ricter, Allusion, ULTRATUMBA, Domain, IRA, A.N.I.M.A.L., Leprycorn and Mechanical Chaos. TRANSMETAL returned in September 2002 with the experimental 'El Amor Supremo', this album, their very first to incorporate keyboards and recorded at Studio 880 in San Pablo California, seeing production duties going to the Cancer, DEATH, Disincarnate, Testament and Konkhra credited guitarist JAMES MURPHY. The band's December 2003 album, 'Lo Podrido Corona La Inmensidad', saw keyboard contributions coming from Erick Fuentes Quintana and a guest guitar solo on the track 'Creador De La Amargura' from JAMES MURPHY. 2004 saw TRANSMETAL tackling an album, 'Temple De Acero', comprising entirely of cover versions including the Scorpions 'The Zoo', Candlemass' 'At The Gallows End', Celtic Frost's 'Return To The Eve' and 'Dethroned Emperor', Accept's 'Balls To The Wall', AC/DC's 'Back In Black' and 'Let Me Put My Love Into You', Sodom's 'Remember The Fallen', BLACK SABBATH's 'Evil Woman', DEATH's 'Evil Death', Uriah Heep's 'Free And Easy' and Twisted Sister's 'The Kids Are Back'. A notable compilation issued in June that same year, '17 Years Down In Hell', re-worked the tracks from the previous two albums, 'El Amor Supremo' and 'Lo Podrido Corona La Inmensidad', in English language. An unaccredited track, a newly recorded version of 'Aborrecer Al Forence', saw Mauricio Torres on vocals. New studio album 'El Despertar De La Adversidad' arrived in February 2006, capitalised on by a run of Mexican shows, gigs in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and spot US gigs. The band would be back in the recording studio before the end of the year cutting the 'Progresi\u00f3n Neur\u00f3tica' album for November.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "333 E 60th St, New York, NY 10022", "Artist": "Rick Wonder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11559881.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.760847, -73.9622976], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Open Format Club And Radio Dj, Edm, House, Tech House, Open Format, Bass House", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Sapphire New York", "moreBioInfo": "", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1801 Ocean Ave, Belmar, NJ 07719", "Artist": "Joe Maz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8970961.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.1702978, -74.0164707], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "D'jais Oceanview Bar & Cafe", "moreBioInfo": "The name Joe Maz is known throughout clubs & DJs all around the world.

His songwriting uses a palette of Blues, Country, Jazz and Rock with a sensitivity and wit that has also earned him the broad fan base most instrumental guitarist never enjoy. Campilongo's career began in the mid 1970s when he studied guitar in his native San Francisco with the eccentric Bunnie Gregoire, who taught the pre-teen to embrace everything from George Van Eps to John Denver. Campilongo recalls, \"Before Bunnie I used to just randomly buy records if there weren't that many songs on them, I didn't care who the artist was. A banner day would be discovering a double album that only had two songs on it. So I ended up with John Coltrane Live in Japan and John McLaughlin's Devotion with Larry Young on organ. I listened to those records until they melted and I still do to this day (on CD). Eventually, I found Roy Buchanan's first album and all bets were off, I was going to be a guitar player.\" Jim's first instrument was purchased with Green Stamps. In addition to Chet Atkins and Roy Buchanan, Jim began to be deeply affected by Muddy Waters and the Sex Pistols. Around this time he was given a 1959 Telecaster by an appreciative student in exchange for successful bass lessons. \"Playing that '59 Tele changed everything for me,\" Campilongo remembers, \"It was like it told me to get serious.\" Soon after, he formed the hugely popular Ten Gallon Cats, which featured pedal steel guitar and Jim's ever-expanding Country/Jazz vocabulary. They recorded three CDs. Jim broke from the Cats and reached a creative pinnacle in his existing body of work with 1998's Table For One, a collection of winsome and elegant compositions praised by Billboard as, \"Americana at its most touching\". Guitar Player affirmed the CD as a showcase for Campilongo's \"darkly romantic melodicism\". The record also garnered Campilongo a new level of recognition. In 2002, Campilongo pulled up stakes and moved to New York, where he formed his Electric Trio, which toured Europe and Scandinavia and recorded the acclaimed CD American Hips, lauded by Guitar Player as \"easily his best effort to date\". No Depression raved, \"Campilongo meets himself every time he picks up his instrument; that brand of artistic bravery is rare and to be treasured.\" Since 2004 the \"Campy Trio\" reigns each Monday night at New York's Living Room, a residency that Time Out New York recommended as \"one of the city's strongest\". Jim's new CD, entitled Heaven is Creepy is set for an August, 2006 release.

He is known as a great jazz, latin and classical pianist with superb technical ability, and has played and recorded with many world-famous musicians. Michel lists some of his main influences as Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and Art Tatum. Michel was born into a musical family and as a young child showed great aptitude for the accordion that his parents gave him. Although he enjoyed the accordion, it was his grandparents' piano that sparked his interest the most, so at aged 9 he asked his parents to buy him one. Their response was to first send him to the Elementary Music School, part of the National Conservatory, and then a year later to grant his wish. The formal system of the music school taught Michel to play in the classical style, and by aged 16 he was playing with the National Symphony Orchestra of the Dominican Republic. Michel comments on his first encounter with the sounds of jazz, in an interview with the All About Jazz website: \u201dThe first time I heard jazz was when I was 14 and a half. I heard the great Art Tatum on the radio playing his solo piano rendition of 'Tea for Two.' That immediately caught my ear. I just wanted to soak it in, to learn to play that style. Then I found out it was jazz.\u201d Michel studied for 13 years at the National Conservatory, and whilst developing his strong classical abilities was also heavily influenced by the bop tradition, and by the contemporary jazz of Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. His influences at this time also included Horace Silver, Erroll Garner, and the ragtime music of Scott Joplin. When the Harvard University Jazz Band visited the Dominican Republic and heard Michel at a jam session, the bandleader encouraged him, 'You should be in the States', and so the idea was planted. In 1979 Michel moved to New York to study at Mannes College and at The Juilliard School, and broke onto the international stage in 1983 when Tito Puente's pianist was unable to make a concert at the Montreal Jazz Festival. On a recommendation, without hearing him, Tito asked Michel to play. Cuban reedman Paquito D'Rivera was in the audience, and immediately offered him a place in his band. For four years Michel toured internationally with Paquito, and recorded two albums with him. Michel's emergence as a star in his own right began around 1985, the year he debuted with his trio at Carnegie Hall. In that same year he toured Europe with Paquito D\u2019Rivera\u2019s quintet, and recorded his first album, Why Not?, for Japan\u2019s King label. In 1988 Michel debuted on a major record label, Sony, with the release of Michel Camilo. This became a bestseller and held the top jazz album spot for ten consecutive weeks. Other bestselling albums followed and so did the accolades, including a Grammy and an Emmy. Michel's collaborative 2000 album with flamenco guitarist Tomatito, Spain won Best Latin Jazz Album in the first Latin Grammy Awards. As well as being an outstanding performer, Michel is a talented composer and has written scores for several Spanish language films including Los Peores A\u00f1os de Nuestra Vida and the award-winning Amo Tu Cama Rica. Michel tours extensively, and lectures in Europe, the US and in the Puerto Rico Conservatory. He holds several honorary degrees, a Visiting Professorship at Berklee College of Music, and has been honored in his home country by being named a Knight of the Heraldic Order of Christopher Columbus, and being awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez & Mella.

During this time Braxton recorded and released his first EP called Sketch (2014), quickly followed by Braxton Cook meets Butcher Brown (2015).

The album had 4 tracks that landed on Spotify's Top 50 Viral in the U.S. playlist. Shortly thereafter, multiple tracks from the album were listed on State of Jazz and Alternative R&B playlists and Braxton was later placed on the cover of The Butter Playlist. In Spring of 2018, Braxton worked with a number of West Coast producers (Swarvy, Kiefer, Allmos) to create a collaborative project called Somewhere in Between: Remixes & Outtakes.

Drive. Determination. That\u2019s what Leanne Weiss and Derek Allan bring to country music. You won\u2019t find them sitting still, nor can you try to stop them. Long before their formation as country duo October Rose, these two were separately chasing similar dreams with the same level of ambition, but in different states. Growing up in the suburbs of Northern New Jersey, Leanne idolized vocalists like Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, writing songs through her teenage years and performing wherever she could in whatever genre she could. After a bout of divine inspiration, Weiss took a chance and recorded her first country EP. \u201cI saw Carrie Underwood in concert, and couldn\u2019t sleep that night. My desire to pursue my dreams was so strong.\u201d Weiss quickly garnered opening slots for Kenny Rogers, Dierks Bentley, and Kristian Bush of Sugarland and shows at classic venues like Nashville\u2019s The Bluebird. Despite her success, she considered throwing in the towel and putting her music career on hold. \u201cI was feeling frustrated,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what my next move would be after three years of recording and performing.\u201d Three hundred and sixty five miles away in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Derek was on a musical journey that began at age elven when his mom gave him a gift that would change his life\u2014his first guitar. \u201cShe bought my dad, my brother, and me guitars for my dad\u2019s birthday,\u201d Derek recalls. \u201cI started taking lessons.\u201d He actively honed his skills as a musician, songwriter, singer\u2014and bodybuilder. Though growing up partial to 80\u2019s hair metal bands like Warrant and Def Leppard, it was undeniable that country music was in his blood. Before long, Derek was performing his original songs and quickly establishing himself in Pittsburgh music scene. Opening slots for prominent bands like The Stickers were paving the way for him to make his mark in his home city. Then in early 2016, a job change brought Derek to New Jersey, unaware of the story that fate had in store for both he and Leanne. After stumbling across Leanne\u2019s music video, Derek contacted her via Facebook, wanting to make some new friends in country music. The two chatted and Derek came out to one of her shows. \u201cI wound up sitting next to her mom, who talked her daughter up,\u201d says Derek. When Leanne took the stage with her band, Derek knew mom was right. The two met after the show and became fast friends, hanging out and writing music together. \u201cWhen we started harmonizing together, it was like the world stopped,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cWe knew we had something incredible.\u201d Suffice it to say, she wasn\u2019t about to give up on music anytime soon, and fate was moving her into a new direction. Derek knew then his move to New Jersey was his destiny. But could they abandon the solo careers they had built and form a brand new duo? ?Their answer to that is reflected in the first song they ever wrote together. \u2018\u201cHeartbreak Song\u2019 is so special to us because it symbolizes the leap of faith we took in our musical relationship,\u201d says Derek. The two had plotted out their goals and strategized their musical game plan that summer. Without hesitation, they announced their debut at a New York City show in October 2016 in front of friends and family. It was clear they had made the right decision. ?Since their formation, October Rose\u2019s momentum grows stronger by the day. \u201cHeartbreak Song,\u201d the emotional song that started it all, is gaining critical acclaim and traction on the country music charts. And with a rigorous schedule of performing all over the country, this duo continues to win audiences over with their energetic stage performances. \u201cWe\u2019ve already opened for awesome acts like Jake Owen, Drew Baldridge, Russell Dickerson, Jimmie Allen, and Jordan Davis,\u201c Leanne says of their performance credits. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring our fans new music.\u201d ? Their debut EP, \u201cAll In\u201d features six songs, including the motivational title track. \u201c\u2019All In\u201d is our follow-up to \u2018Heartbreak Song,\u201d in that it epitomizes the strength of our partnership as a duo and our desire to go \u2018all in\u2019 with our dreams,\u201d says Derek. Produced, engineered, and mixed by Chris Badami of Portrait Recording Studios, their debut EP is a labor of love and a testament to their unique style of writing and performing. With their unmistakable chemistry and a contagious, rock-infused sound, October Rose is undoubtedly a formidable and unstoppable presence in country music. It\u2019s clear to see that the same fate that brought them together will move them toward their mutual dream. Currently, October Rose is on the road and releasing new music in 2020.", "otherInfo": "October Rose performs for the Morris Township Outdoor Concert Series at Ginty Field.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today. Having made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own. While it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center. The group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth. Curtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d \u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d Understanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet. The dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says. The emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life. Curtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d Establishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop. Curtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums. \u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board. \u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "327 Bowery, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Kelley Swindall ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11432861.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7257471, -73.9917966], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk, Country, Americana, Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bowery Electric", "moreBioInfo": "With a rafter reaching voice and crazily charismatic stage presence, Kelley Swindall has toured the country solo with her fiercely unique sound, for the better part of the decade.

His captivating voice, great ear for harmonies, and melodic guitar playing make him a sought-after collaborator. With Anais Mitchell, he wrote and recorded Child Ballads, an album of English traditional folk songs that was lauded with a prestigious BBC2-Folk Award. His duo with Eamon O\u2019Leary, The Murphy Beds, has toured extensively across the USA and Europe, opening for Glen Hansard, Bonnie \u2018Prince\u2019 Billy, Beth Orton, and Sam Amidon. He recently recorded with grammy-winning folk artist Sarah Jarosz, and has released LP\u2019s with Session Americana and Laura Cortese. His first solo record of original songs, Alameda, was released in 2018. The songs on Alameda are largely road stories, celebrating the lives of people on the fringes of society. For the New Yorker, Robert Sullivan writes, \u201c\u2018Alameda,\u2019 the title track on Hamer\u2019s album, is a rock ballad with crispy guitar licks and geographic lyrics about a wandering worker, who is maybe the author, but maybe not. In the way that it talks about a long search for work, it reminds me of Woody Guthrie\u2019s Columbia River song series\u2026\u201d Propelled by tasteful electric and acoustic guitar, Hamer\u2019s rapport with the traditional ballads (he is a regular singer and guitar accompanist at several weekly NYC Irish music sessions) shines on original narratives like \u2018Alameda\u2019 and the sweeping \u2018Champlain,\u2019 a cross-country love story that begins lakeside on the border between Vermont and New York. Bassist Jeff Picker (Ricky Skaggs, Sarah Jarosz) and drummer John Fatum (The Rad Trads) form a powerful, responsive rhythm section. The album was entirely self-produced, engineered, and mixed by Hamer in New York\u2019s Lethe Lounge studio. Overdubs are few, but a small gathering of New York and Boston luminaries add their signatures; Jim Fitting\u2019s (Session Americana, Treat Her Right) harmonica shines on \u2018Moving Day\u2019, and Alec Spiegelman (Cuddle Magic) plays flute and bass clarinet on several tracks including \u2018Vagabond\u2019, an energetic singalong dealing with themes of migration and displacement. Exquisite harmony vocals are furnished by Hannah Read and Sarah Jarosz. Alameda tells carefully written stories that bear repeated listening, infusing songwriter narratives with amplified live-band excitement. \u201cJefferson uses his warm voice and lyrical guitar to tell stories and paint human pictures\u2026 His guitar has that rippling twang and flow of electric Richard Thompson.\u201d -Marc Higgins / fatea magazine \u201cA gifted guitarist and singer, Hamer is able to hit close harmonies and weave gorgeous instrumental lines.\u201d -Acoustic Guitar \u201cA spellbinding guitarist and songwriter\u201d \u2013Brooklynbased.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Robert Dean ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6737185, -73.9916803], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bell House", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Dan Joe DVD Show \u2022Tuesday, July 27\u30fb7:00pm Doors\u30fb8:00pm Show"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Peter Asher ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617156.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Classical", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "City Winery New York", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "709 Lorimer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Will Leet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11493595.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7180854, -73.95025059999999], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Americana, Rock & Folk, Alt-country, Pop Rock, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Will Leet at Pete\u2019s Candy Store", "moreBioInfo": "Will Leet is a NYC based singer-songwriter, formerly known as Instant Treeline.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

The Philadelphia punk band had released their third album, Patience, to abundant critical acclaim, and was touring steadily behind it. After nearly a decade of playing, the band finally had gotten the chance to turn music into a full-time occupation. And then, just as their career was lifting off, the world around them collapsed. COVID-19 reached the United States, rescinding life as many people knew it. Live music shut down. Mannequin Pussy had just played a final show in Chicago when the group had to cancel the remainder of their tour and travel back to their home city. For a while, it seemed like maybe the lull would be temporary, a brief pause before things could resume as they were. And then the numbers ballooned, and the months stretched on, and memories of rooms packed with strangers started to feel alien, dangerous even in imagination. Mannequin Pussy's new Perfect EP bursts forth from those sprawling months of social isolation and internet-fueled anxiety. After spending most of the year apart from each other and everyone else in 2020, the members of the band -- Missy on lead vocals and guitar, Colins \u201cBear\u201d Regisford on bass, and Kaleen Reading on drums -- decided to book studio time and work together in person again. They brought two pre-written songs into the session, but opted to write new material together on the fly from the excitement of reunion. \"We just figured if we forced ourselves into this situation where someone could hit 'record,' something might come out,\" Missy says. \"We'd never written that way before.\" What came out of that compressed session time were some of Mannequin Pussy's most furious, incandescent songs yet. The self-imposed restraint and careful habituation of the past year cracked open. On the EP's title track, Missy sings about the practice of condensing your daily life into a manicured stream of images for social media, an urge that only intensified after daily life grew barren. What happens to the social impulse when everyone you love or even like is leveled into a set of pixels -- when you're compelled repeatedly to funnel your own life into that algorithmic slurry, and wait to see how it's received? \"It was a really weird psychological experience, being bombarded by images of other people constantly when you are not around a lot of other people,\" Missy says. \"I'm still understanding the way we use the internet to make our lives feel and look perfect. Our lives aren't supposed to look good right now.\" Even the songs written before the pandemic take on a new valence after a year of its frustrations. \"I'm in control / That's what I tell myself when all the walls around me close in,\" Missy sings in the prescient opening lines of \"Control.\" Tuneful and brash, with a white-hot molten core, the songs on Perfect thrash against the learned helplessness that has settled in on the cellular level under lockdown. Social media algorithms apply pressure to perform even from the depths of that powerlessness, to construct the image of a bountiful life in times of extreme scarcity. From the smolder of \"Pigs is Pigs\" to the melancholic, contemplative \"Darling,\" Perfect digs into the cracks of that compulsory veneer, and let loose everything simmering beneath it. The anger, frustration, loneliness, and resentment of a year spent locked away all come sputtering forth. And once they've rushed out, once the air clears from their tumult, there's suddenly a little more space to seek out calm, to find solace. There's an opening forward into whatever comes next in the rush and the mess of living.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1288 Myrtle ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Shelter Dogs ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6980033, -73.9247038], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bushwick Public House", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "76 Audrey Zapp Drive, Jersey City, NJ 07305", "Artist": "Daniela Darcourt ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7092337, -74.0399722], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "LIBERTY HOUSE HALL", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Clarence Spady Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11176687.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7284039, -73.9992845], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Terra Blues", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Cipha Sounds ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8957616.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "Music Comedy, Comedy, Hip Hop, Improvisation, Standup Comedy", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Upstairs)", "moreBioInfo": "Most DJs spend their entire life in the shadows.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years. Cipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic. Cipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world. After being a student at the UCB theatre for over two years, Cipha now has a weekly sold out \u201cTake It Personal: Hip Hop Improv Show, where a different Hip Hop celebrity tells a true life story and Cipha & his team of improvisers perform a complete live comedy show based on those stories.

Purchase and Stream at https://delicatesteve.ffm.to/tilliburnup _________________ DELICATE STEVE TILL I BURN UP ANTI- \u201cIn a time where nothing makes sense, or when everyone is trying to make sense of everything, even the right idea might not make perfect sense to everybody at that moment.\u201d Steve Marion, the songwriter, guitarist, and producer who has made four studio records of primarily word-less, guitar-first music as Delicate Steve, is talking about the bifurcated and reactionary culture of the moment. But by no coincidence he\u2019s also describing musical moments that helped to inspire Till I Burn Up (Anti-, 2019) his forthcoming LP. The album name comes from a line in Dr. John's \u201cWalk on Guilded Splinters\u201d where Steve misheard John\u2019s actual phrase \"Tit Alberta\" as \"Till I Burn Up.\" But more than fodder for an album title, John\u2019s Gris Gris, and records like it, informed a new frame-of- mind for an artist who has historically set out to make a predetermined statement with every recording. \u201cThe idea of this young freak making Gris Gris in LA, and nobody knowing what to do with it in 1968... He gave me confidence to be a little more freaky and abstract instead of quirky and nicely-packaged like my last album was.\u201d Steve goes on to cite early records by Iggy Pop and Dylan and The Band\u2019s electric tour that were panned at the time and lauded in hindsight. \u201cThere is a confidence that comes with abandoning the idea of wanting to create something that everyone might like to check out.\u201d But all is not bifurcated, and we know two things can be true at once. The confidence necessary for Steve to make Till I Burn Up could also be self-inspired. Now nearly ten years into his career, Steve is a cult artist of his time who has been called to record with his heroes (Paul Simon, Kanye West) and contribute significantly to his contemporaries\u2019 modern masterworks (Amen Dunes, Freedom), all the while recording and releasing his own critically hailed work and sharing the stage with Tame Impala, Mac DeMarco, Growlers and others. The artist whose songwriting and playing has been marked through by transcendent moments of buoyancy and joy has created a pulsing and propulsive record in Till I Burn Up. He put up at a studio in Woodstock and found himself playing Freddie Mercury\u2019s Oberheim synthesizer and his guitar plugged into Robbie Robertson\u2019s Fender amp. With the intent to turn away from the times, Steve managed instead to document the sound of this moment -- the ever-undwinding feed that feeds the feedback loop of talking heads, twitter tick-ticking like a bomb, the timed drip- like morphine- of news breaking in our hands, the party before the shoe drops, our interior dialogue, all the contradictions... A song called \u201cFreedom\u201d is underpinned by a grinding circular guitar line interrupted by what sounds like synthetic warning sirens. \u201cRat in the House\u201d, \u201cRubberneck\u201d, and \u201cMadness\u201d are blinkered dancefloor rippers suited for a bunker party. \u201cSelfie of Man\u201d recognizes the pervasive behavior and its result, as a literal portrait of our times. It moves along in marched lockstep, with inversely reflecting guitar lines. The album\u2019s closer \u2018Dream\u2019 allows Steve and his listeners some free range. Until then, each song is self-contained and self-referential -- an ouroboros within a greater ouroboros called Till I Burn Up. There are turns on Till I Burn Up as dark as anything Delicate Steve has recorded, but not without reminders that a joy ride into an apocalypse is still a joy ride. Like the harrowing moment it documents, Till I Burn Up would not be true if not imbued by contradiction. True to form, this Delicate Steve record is a distillation.", "otherInfo": "SULTAN ROOM UNDER THE STARS - \nAN OPEN-AIR CONCERT ON THE TURK\u2019S INN ROOFTOP"}, {"Address": "115 Macdougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Bryan Stephens ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7301811, -74.0007016], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Wha", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "300 Ocean Ave, Point Pleasant Beach, NJ 08742", "Artist": "October Rose Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11499264.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.09484, -74.0365302], "Date": "2021-07-28", "EventDate": "Jul. 28th, 2021", "Genre": "Country Pop, Country Pop-rock, United States, Country", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Jenks Club", "moreBioInfo": "Passion. Drive. Determination. That\u2019s what Leanne Weiss and Derek Allan bring to country music. You won\u2019t find them sitting still, nor can you try to stop them. Long before their formation as country duo October Rose, these two were separately chasing similar dreams with the same level of ambition, but in different states. Growing up in the suburbs of Northern New Jersey, Leanne idolized vocalists like Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, writing songs through her teenage years and performing wherever she could in whatever genre she could. After a bout of divine inspiration, Weiss took a chance and recorded her first country EP. \u201cI saw Carrie Underwood in concert, and couldn\u2019t sleep that night. My desire to pursue my dreams was so strong.\u201d Weiss quickly garnered opening slots for Kenny Rogers, Dierks Bentley, and Kristian Bush of Sugarland and shows at classic venues like Nashville\u2019s The Bluebird. Despite her success, she considered throwing in the towel and putting her music career on hold. \u201cI was feeling frustrated,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what my next move would be after three years of recording and performing.\u201d Three hundred and sixty five miles away in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Derek was on a musical journey that began at age elven when his mom gave him a gift that would change his life\u2014his first guitar. \u201cShe bought my dad, my brother, and me guitars for my dad\u2019s birthday,\u201d Derek recalls. \u201cI started taking lessons.\u201d He actively honed his skills as a musician, songwriter, singer\u2014and bodybuilder. Though growing up partial to 80\u2019s hair metal bands like Warrant and Def Leppard, it was undeniable that country music was in his blood. Before long, Derek was performing his original songs and quickly establishing himself in Pittsburgh music scene. Opening slots for prominent bands like The Stickers were paving the way for him to make his mark in his home city. Then in early 2016, a job change brought Derek to New Jersey, unaware of the story that fate had in store for both he and Leanne. After stumbling across Leanne\u2019s music video, Derek contacted her via Facebook, wanting to make some new friends in country music. The two chatted and Derek came out to one of her shows. \u201cI wound up sitting next to her mom, who talked her daughter up,\u201d says Derek. When Leanne took the stage with her band, Derek knew mom was right. The two met after the show and became fast friends, hanging out and writing music together. \u201cWhen we started harmonizing together, it was like the world stopped,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cWe knew we had something incredible.\u201d Suffice it to say, she wasn\u2019t about to give up on music anytime soon, and fate was moving her into a new direction. Derek knew then his move to New Jersey was his destiny. But could they abandon the solo careers they had built and form a brand new duo? ?Their answer to that is reflected in the first song they ever wrote together. \u2018\u201cHeartbreak Song\u2019 is so special to us because it symbolizes the leap of faith we took in our musical relationship,\u201d says Derek. The two had plotted out their goals and strategized their musical game plan that summer. Without hesitation, they announced their debut at a New York City show in October 2016 in front of friends and family. It was clear they had made the right decision. ?Since their formation, October Rose\u2019s momentum grows stronger by the day. \u201cHeartbreak Song,\u201d the emotional song that started it all, is gaining critical acclaim and traction on the country music charts. And with a rigorous schedule of performing all over the country, this duo continues to win audiences over with their energetic stage performances. \u201cWe\u2019ve already opened for awesome acts like Jake Owen, Drew Baldridge, Russell Dickerson, Jimmie Allen, and Jordan Davis,\u201c Leanne says of their performance credits. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring our fans new music.\u201d ? Their debut EP, \u201cAll In\u201d features six songs, including the motivational title track. \u201c\u2019All In\u201d is our follow-up to \u2018Heartbreak Song,\u201d in that it epitomizes the strength of our partnership as a duo and our desire to go \u2018all in\u2019 with our dreams,\u201d says Derek. Produced, engineered, and mixed by Chris Badami of Portrait Recording Studios, their debut EP is a labor of love and a testament to their unique style of writing and performing. With their unmistakable chemistry and a contagious, rock-infused sound, October Rose is undoubtedly a formidable and unstoppable presence in country music. It\u2019s clear to see that the same fate that brought them together will move them toward their mutual dream. Currently, October Rose is on the road and releasing new music in 2020.", "otherInfo": "October Rose will be sharing the stage with Drew Green at Jenks Country Wednesdays. Doors open at 7:30.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra. \"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section. One of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work. Lovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years. He is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award.

For Japanese Breakfast\u2019s Michelle Zauner, it involved diving deeper into herself to evolve as an artist. With the release of her sophomore album Soft Sounds From Another Planet, Zauner expanded the breadth of the shimmering bedroom pop displayed on her debut Psychopomp. Her voice and vision came clearer into focus as she used the extended metaphor of outer space to observe the pain that defined the first part of her career. Full of gleaming guitars and haunting electronics, Soft Sounds earned critical acclaim and new fans around the world, quickly making Japanese Breakfast a household name among the indie rock contingent. Much of 2018 saw Zauner on the road, further honing her live show and performing for massive audiences. All the while, she kept busy\u2014not only as Japanese Breakfast, but as Michelle Zauner: video game composer, prolific music video director, and author. Fans eager for new music from Zauner were pleasantly surprised in summer 2018, when she revealed \u201cGlider\u201d in the E3 announce trailer for the breathtaking new adventure game Sable. Drawing from her years of songwriting experience while making new explorations into creating ambient and experimental music, she composed the entire soundtrack for the highly-anticipated indie game, which is due out early 2020. Having helmed every visual for Soft Sounds, Zauner is also well underway making a name for herself as a sought-after director, working with longtime collaborator Adam Kolodny to craft music videos for other artists. To date, she\u2019s brought her visual signatures to artists like Phoebe Bridgers and Conor Oberst, Jay Som, and Charly Bliss. Between tours, studio sessions, and video shoots, Zauner has long been working on a memoir of her early childhood, time spent between the U.S. and South Korea, and the split heritage that has shaped so much of her life. An excerpt from that book, \u201cCrying in H-Mart,\u201d was published in The New Yorker at the end of 2018.

Dion Francis DiMucci (b July 18, 1939), better known as Dion, is an American singer-songwriter, now widely recognized as one of the top singers of his era, blending the best elements of doo-wop, pop, and R&B styles. Early years Dion was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx borough of New York City. As a child, he used to accompany his father, a vaudeville entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of country music \u2013 particularly Hank Williams \u2013 and the blues and doo-wop stars he heard in local bars and on the radio. His singing abilities were honed on the street corners of Crotona Avenue, where he rounded up other local singers inventing acapella licks, and in local clubs. In early 1957 he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz, who had just formed Mohawk Records. They recorded him with a vocal group, The Timberlanes, and released a single \"The Chosen Few\", arranged by Hugo Montenegro, which became a minor regional hit. With the Belmonts, 1957-1960 Schwartz also signed up Dion's friends, The Belmonts, named after nearby Belmont Avenue. Their breakthrough together came in early 1958, when \"I Wonder Why\" made # 22 on the national US charts, followed up with \"No One Knows\" and \"Don\u2019t Pity Me\" which were also chart hits. This success won Dion and the Belmonts a place on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. On 2 February 1959, after playing at Clear Lake, Iowa, Dion decided that he could not afford the $36 cost of a flight to the next venue [1]. The plane crashed, and Holly and the other stars were killed. In March 1959, Dion and the Belmonts\u2019 next single, \"A Teenager In Love\", was released, making # 5 in the US pop charts and # 28 in the UK. Their biggest hit, \"Where or When\", was released in November 1959, and reached #3 on the US charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked in to hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful, there were musical and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960 Dion decided to quit for a solo career. Solo stardom, 1960-1964 1961 album coverBy the end of 1960, Dion had recorded and released his first solo album, Alone With Dion, and the single \"Lonely Teenager\", which rose to # 12 in the US charts. Follow-ups \"Havin\u2019 Fun\" and \"Kissin\u2019 Game\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with new vocal group the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \"Runaround Sue\", stormed up the charts, reaching # 1 in the US charts in September 1961, and # 11 in the UK, where he also toured. For the next single, the record company promoted the A-side, \"The Majestic\", but it was the B-side, Maresca\u2019s song \"The Wanderer\", which received the radio plays and again rose swiftly up the charts, reaching # 2 in the US charts in December 1961 and # 10 in the UK. As a classic oldie, it made the UK top twenty again in 1976. By the end of 1961, Dion was a major star, with a worldwide touring schedule, and he followed up with a string of hit singles \u2013 \"Lovers Who Wander\" (# 3), \"Little Diane\" (# 8), \"Love Came To Me\" (# 10) and \"Ruby Baby\" (# 2) all making the top ten in 1962. Several of these were written or co-written by Dion. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander. At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records, the first rock and roll artist ever signed to that label. Although the first single, Leiber and Stoller\u2019s \"Ruby Baby\", was a big hit, reaching # 2, several follow-ups were less so, although \"Donna the Prima Donna\" and \"Drip Drop\" both reached # 6 in the charts in late 1963. Nevertheless, problems with his addiction and changing public tastes did cause him to enter a period of commercial decline. Changing fortunes, 1964-1968 Following a European tour, Dion returned to the USA and was introduced to classic blues music by Columbia\u2019s John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon\u2019s \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"Spoonful\", but these releases \u2013 some produced by Tom Wilson, with Al Kooper on keyboards - were not commercially successful. In 1966, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts for the album Together Again on ABC Records. Again, this bombed, despite one classic self-penned song, \"My Girl The Month Of May\". Although by this stage Dion\u2019s career appeared to be nearing an end, he retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, the only pop artist featured on the album cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. In April 1968, Dion had a powerful religious experience. After getting clean from drug use, he approached Laurie Records for a new contract, and they agreed on condition that he record the song \"Abraham, Martin and John\", written by Dick Holler (also the writer of The Royal Guardsmen\u2019s \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\") in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy during the summer of 1968. The success of this song \u2013 later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye \u2013 which reached # 4 in the US charts, resuscitated Dion\u2019s career. The mature period, 1968-1986 Born To Be With You, 1975For the next few years, Dion\u2019s music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to critical acclaim but moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969. There followed a one-off live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden in 1972, released on album. This was followed in 1975 by the album Born To Be With You, eccentrically produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who. In 1978 Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, Return of the Wanderer, another critical success and commercial failure. In December 1979 he experienced a life-changing religious experience, documented in this article [1]. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian music vein, in which he released a number of albums on the Dayspring label reflecting his religious convictions. Recent work In 1987 Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. This helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences. In 1988 Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled The Wanderer: Dion's Story was published. In the following year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the induction speech being given by Lou Reed. In 1989 he returned to secular rock music with the album Yo Frankie, and since then has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His D\u00e9j\u00e0 Nu album in 2000 found him covering Bruce Springsteen, a major follower over the years. He joined Scott Kempner of the Del-Lords and Mike Mesaros of The Smithereens in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted. In January 2006 he released Bronx in Blue, an album of blues and country standards, which was critically acclaimed and nominated for a Grammy. As a practicing Catholic, Dion pursues prison ministry and reaches out to men going through addiction recovery.", "otherInfo": "Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Dion will always represent a special time and place a moment when a song could mean so much and a singer could sum up what it means to be young, in love and on top of the world.

Since the 1970s, Lovano has been one of the world's premiere tenor saxophone players, earning a Grammy award and several nods on Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Lovano was exposed throughout his early life to jazz by his father, Tony \"Big T\" Lovano. John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Stitt were among his earlier influences. He developed further at Berklee College of Music, and then served a big band apprenticeship with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd and the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra. \"Big T\" Lovano, a fine Cleveland tenorman, was his first inspiration. He taught Joe all the standards, how to lead a gig, how to pace a set, and to be versatile enough to always find work. Joe started on alto at age six and switched to tenor five years later. He attended Berklee before working with Jack McDuff and Dr. Lonnie Smith. After three years with Woody Herman's Orchestra, Lovano moved to New York and began playing regularly with Mel Lewis\u2019 Big Band. This influence is still present in his solos. He often plays lines that convey the rhythmic drive and punch of an entire horn section. One of the top saxophonists of the 1990s, Joe Lovano continues to grow and explore as a musician. He has a husky tenor tone based in the tradition, but an approach to improvisation that is modern and daring. In the early \u201880s he began working in John Scofield\u2019s Quartet and a bass-less trio with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell. Steeped in the tradition of Ornette Coleman, Motian\u2019s recordings show off Lovano\u2019s avant-garde abilities. Scofield\u2019s Quartet straddled the line between \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d. These recordings feature some of Lovano\u2019s best work. Lovano has enduring musical partnerships with John Scofield and Paul Motian, having participated in some of their most noteworthy projects over the years. He is currently a jazz artist on the international level. His live work, specifically Quarterts at the Village Vanguard, garnered a Down Beat \"Jazz Album of the Year\" award. Other releases include Trio Fascination and 52nd Street Themes.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}]
