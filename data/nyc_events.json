He has recorded and toured with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered around his native New Jersey. Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories. His most famous albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life. He has gradually become identified with progressive politics. He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including eighteen Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, and continues to have a strong global fan base. He has sold over 65 million albums in the U.S, and 120 million worldwide.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Sean Patton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7226363.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-17", "EventDate": "Aug. 17th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative, Singer, Indie, Acoustic, Folk, Songwriter", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022612678-sean-patton-at-the-stand-(main-room)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/mrseanpatton COMIX comixny.com", "otherInfo": "Jessica Kirson, Dulce Sloan, Ryan Long, & More!"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "NOTNORTH ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11632639.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223225, -73.98858129999999], "Date": "2021-08-17", "EventDate": "Aug. 17th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "NOTNORTH w/ OK KING", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102812988-notnorth-at-rockwood-music-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "NOTNORTH\n\nI\u2019m trying to bring the drama back into music, letting expression eclipse perfection.

A guy bashing his drums, another dude wielding a guitar like a percussive, blunt weapon while howling into a mic somehow manages to sound bigger and brasher than the computerized bombast of every six-piece metal band. A splash of roots, a soulful yearning for mid century Americana and the fiery passion of post punk ferocity rampages over a record of earnestly forceful tracks like a runaway locomotive. Josh Scogin wasn\u2019t out of elementary school when the Flat Duo Jets laid their first album down on two tracks in a garage. But the scrappy band\u2019s spirit of raw power, punchy delivery, tried-and-true rhythms and urgent sense of immediacy is alive and well in \u201968. Heralded by Alternative Press as one of 2014\u2019s Most Anticipated Albums, In Humor and Sadness is a snapshot of a fiery new beginning for one of modern Metalcore\u2019s most celebrated frontmen. Produced by longtime Scogin collaborator Matt Goldman (Underoath, Anberlin, The Devil Wears Prada), the first full offering from \u201968 is a broad reaching slab of ambitious showmanship delivered with few tools and fewer pretensions. The scratchy disharmonic pop of Nirvana\u2019s Bleach is in there, for sure. And while many associate the setup with The Black Keys, \u201968 is more like Black Keys on crack. \u201cI wanted it to be as loud and obnoxious as it can be,\u201d Scogin explains. \u201cI want it to be in-your-face. I want people who hear us live to just be like, \u2018There's no way this is just two dudes!\u2019 That became sort of the subplot to our entire existence. \u2018How much noise can two guys make?\u2019 It\u2019s obviously very minimalistic, but in other ways, it\u2019s very big. I have as many amps onstage as a five piece band. Michael only has one cymbal and one tom on his kit, but he plays it like it\u2019s some kind of big \u201880s metal drum setup. It\u2019s minimalistic, but it\u2019s also overkill. We get as much as we can from as little as we can.\u201d Like many pioneers, North Carolina\u2019s the Flat Duo Jet\u2019s blazed a trail for more commercially successful people. They played rootsy rockabilly but with a punk edge. Band leader Dexter Romweber\u2019s solo work was a fist-pounding celebration of audacity and disruption, which influenced the likes of The White Stripes, among other bands. \u201cI got excited when I thought about the distress, the chaos that this two-piece arrangement would create \u2013 one guy having to provide all of these sounds, with a bunch of pedals, with certain chords wigging out and missing notes here and there,\u201d he says with excitement. \u201cThat alone makes up for the chaos of having five people up there.\u201d That idea of less is more, of building something big from something small, persists today at the top of the charts with The Black Keys, just as it\u2019s lived and breathed in the bass-player-less eclectic trio Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, the rule-breaking early \u201890s destruction of Washington D.C.\u2019s Nation of Ulysses, and in the two man attack of \u201968. \u201cJon Spencer\u2019s records always sound like he\u2019s kind of winging it and I love that,\u201d declares Scogin, letting out an affectionate laugh. \u201cIn my last band, that\u2019s how we tried to make our last record feel. The excitement and imperfection is something I love to draw from.\u201d Before paring (and pairing) things down with friend and drummer Michael McClellan, Josh Scogin was the voice, founder and agitprop-style provocateur in The Chariot, who laid waste to convention across a brilliantly unhinged and defiantly unpolished catalog of Noisecore triumphs and dissonant art rock rage. Recorded live in the studio, overdub free, The Chariot\u2019s first album set the tone for a decade to come, owing more to a band like Unsane than whatever passes for \u201cscene.\u201d Scogin was the original singer for Norma Jean and left an influential imprint on the burgeoning Metalcore of the late 90s that persists today, despite having fronted the band for just one of six albums. Whether it\u2019s the genre-defining heft of Norma Jean\u2019s first album or the five records and stage destroying shows of The Chariot, there\u2019s a single constant at the heart of Josh Scogin\u2019s career: a familiarity with the unfamiliar. A new Metalcore band would be a safe third act for the subculture lifer, but Scogin isn\u2019t comfortable unless he\u2019s making himself (and his audience) uncomfortable. \u201cI definitely wanted to flip the script a bit,\u201d he freely confesses. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to play guitar and sing in a band, ever since I left Norma Jean. I needed the freedom of not having a guitar onstage, but now having done that for several years, I wanted the challenge.\u201d Creative problem solving has long been the name of the game for Scogin, whether he was hand stamping ALL 30,000 CDs for The Chariot\u2019s Wars and Rumors of Wars album or figuring out how to pull off his \u201968 song title concept in the digital age of iTunes. Each song on In Humor and Sadness was to be titled with simply a single letter, which when put together vertically on the back of a vinyl LP or compact disc, would spell out a word. However, it's problematic to name more than one song with the same letter, which would have been necessary to spell out what he intended. \u201968 is the forward thinking progress of an artist who finds satisfaction in the expression of dissatisfaction. There\u2019s progression in this regression. Tear apart all of the elements that have enveloped a singer\u2019s performance, strap a guitar on the guy and set him loose with nothing but a beat behind him? It\u2019s a recipe for inventive, fanciful mayhem. After a raucous debut at South By Southwest, a full US tour supporting Chiodos and many more road gigs on the horizon, Scogin and McClellan are propelled by the excitement that comes along with the knowledge that \u201868 is truly just getting started. \u201cWe\u2019ve just broken the tip of the iceberg. We\u2019re really just exploring all the different things we can do,\u201d Scogin promises. \u201cI\u2019ll get more pedals, we\u2019re try different auxiliary instruments, whatever \u2013 the goal is to challenge ourselves and challenge an audience.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "44 Wilson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Reliant Tom ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11591352.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.702624, -73.929611], "Date": "2021-08-18", "EventDate": "Aug. 18th, 2021", "Genre": "Avant Pop, Indie Electronic, Bedroom Pop, Dreampop, Post Grunge, Rock & Pop, Indie Pop, Indie, Art Rock, Shoegaze, Art Pop", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Dh\u00e4r\u00e4 / Reliant Tom / Liezer / Culture in Flames", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102784001-reliant-tom-at-gold-sounds-bar?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Reliant Tom is a Brooklyn-based indie band formed by songwriter & dancer Claire Cuny, in co-partnership with producer & sound artist Monte Weber.", "otherInfo": "We are playing a FREE (donations welcome) show 8.18 at Gold Sounds with an incredible lineup! \n\nDoors 6:30\n7:00-7:45 Culture in Flames\n8:00-8:30 Liezer \n9:00-9:45 Reliant Tom\n10:00-10:45 Dh\u00e4r\u00e4"}, {"Address": "44 Wilson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Dh\u00e4r\u00e4 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11625599.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.702624, -73.929611], "Date": "2021-08-18", "EventDate": "Aug. 18th, 2021", "Genre": "Progressive Rock, Rock", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "FREE SHOW Reliant Tom, Dh\u00e4r\u00e4, Culture in Flames, Liezer ", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102807336-dhara-at-gold-sounds-bar?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "We are an instrumental prog-rock band from Long Island New York.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Her emotionally driven songs blend modern day pop influences with favorites Ella Fitzgerald, Julie London, Patsy Cline, Bonnie Riatt, Carole King, Rickie Lee Jones, and Edie Brickell. Equally inspired by the vocal delivery and songs from male soul singers Bill Withers, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, and Soloman Burke, Jenni Alpert weaves a unique web of eclectic Soul-Americana Pop. Singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist Jenni Alpert was born in Los Angeles and adopted at the age of four. She started to sing and play piano while staying in various foster homes, and later learned to play the guitar as well, and began writing songs early. As familiar with jazz and Americana as she is pop, Alpert graduated from UCLA\u2019s Ethnomusicology Department after completing a four-year jazz program headed by Kenny Burrell. No stranger to the recording studio, Alpert released 5 albums: Pieces (produced by Jimmy Paxson and Stevie Blacke), 27 Minutes in Bologna (produced by Nicola Fantozzi), No Second Guesses (produced by Julian Coryell), Underneath the Surface (produced by Brad Smith, Blind Melon), and Take It All (produced by Mikal Blue). In 2013, Italian label Cappuccino Records decided to release Shining Light, Alpert\u2019s first vinyl, a collection of solo live performances recorded in Italy. Not long after, on a cross country tour of the US, Alpert stopped in Nashville to record a selection of songs live in one take with guitarist Guthrie Trapp (recorded and mixed by Rob Matson) which garnered the attention of SCurve Records who signed her and released Until Then, her most recent body of work. Alpert has independently performed in over 14 countries and her music has been featured on major Network Television shows including Castle (ABC), CSI Miami (CBS) The Real World, Teen Mom, 16 and Pregnant (MTV). She has supported veteran touring artists such as Loudon Wainwright III, Luka Bloom, and Kaki King both in the US and in Europe. Upon releasing a few independent albums on itunes, Alpert was selected to record her song Untied by The Sun Studio Sessions for PBS at Sun Studios in Memphis, TN, recording home of Elvis, Johnny Cash, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, and B. B. King. In Europe, she has covered quite some ground. Fans in Europe may remember her performance in Cambridge supporting Hank Marvin, her full band performance at Morning Glory in Paris, her first vinyl record release on Italian label Cappuccino Records recorded live in Bologna Italy, or perhaps from watching her on tour in the Netherlands, supporting UK artist Jon Allen, Irish songwriter Luka Bloom, and Dutch songwriters Giovanca, and Elske de Wall performing in venues Paradiso, Paard van Troje, and Doornroosje, Tiviloi, Paard Van Troje, Nieuwe Nor and on radio 2 and radio 6 Dolf Jansen. Aussies may recall hearing her music on ABC radio while on the In Search of the Perfect Flat White Tour \u2026. Jenni Alpert plays Gibson guitars and uses D'addario, LR Baggs, Nord Keyboards, Luna, and Bose products. It is the deep connection to the roots of historical recordings of memorial artists and timeless songs in Soul, Country, Amerciana, Jazz and Blues genres made at Motown, Stax, Muscle Shoals, Sun Studios, and Capitol Records that keeps Alpert writing, recording, and performing original music. Shy of five years ago she found and reunited with her birth father Don who was homeless, running from the law, an addict, but a musician just like her. After an extraordinary transformation through an amazing partnership the two now perform together sharing their story and song for others experiencing homelessness and adversity to inspire unique solution solving and creative transitions. www.jennialpert.com www.jennialpert.com", "otherInfo": "Jenni Alpert (Cami) & her birth father Don"}, {"Address": "1288 Myrtle ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Psilocybe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10243719.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6980033, -73.9247038], "Date": "2021-08-18", "EventDate": "Aug. 18th, 2021", "Genre": "Rhythm & Grind", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "NYC Metal & Punk: Bitch Switch, Necrotic Society, Eternal Throne, Psilocybe", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102797331-psilocybe-at-bushwick-public-house?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "This metal quartet uses pop structures, melds together get down grooves with ruthless melodies, and adds a dash of punk spunk.", "otherInfo": "DJ Gorilla and Scenic Present:\nNYC Metal & Punk\nBitch Switch, Necrotic Society, Eternal Throne, Psilocybe\nBushwick Public House\n1288 Myrtle Ave, 21+\nAugust 18 7pm doors"}, {"Address": "1626 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", "Artist": "Kenny Williams ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6198985.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.76111050000001, -73.9840479], "Date": "2021-08-18", "EventDate": "Aug. 18th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Carolines On Broadway", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022465568-kenny-williams-at-carolines-on-broadway?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Kenny Williams (official fan page) www.kennywilliamsmusic.net", "otherInfo": "All shows are 18+ unless accompanied by an adult.

It can be read as a children's show or a parody of a children's show. Much of the humor has a twist aimed at adults, in the style of Soupy Sales and Pee Wee Herman. The show featured character comedy, puppetry, some audience participation, musical guests, and Floyd's piano playing. One of Floyd's puppet sidekicks \u2013 actually a ventriloquial figure \u2013 was named Oogie. His on-air interaction with off-camera staff and sidekicks is somewhat in the style of what Howard Stern and Chelsea Handler would later do. Local bands such as The Smithereens, The Shades, and R. Stevie Moore, along with such well-known performers as The Ramones, Tiny Tim, Benny Bell, Bon Jovi, Jan and Dean, Peter Tork, Squeeze, David Johansen, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Joe Jackson, and Cyndi Lauper also appeared on Floyd's program. The show's first cast members in 1974 included Pat Cupo, and Marc Nathan, the cameraman. Later members were Scott Gordon, Craig \"Mugsy\" Calam, Richard \"Netto\" Cornetto, Jim Monaco, Art \"Looney Skip\" Rooney, Charlie Stoddard, David \"Artie Delmar\" Burd, and Clark the Wonder Dog. A phonograph album based on the show, The Uncle Floyd Show Album, was released on Mercury Records, and a number of 45 rpm singles on the Bioya label were released around 1979\u201383. Vivino has also released a few CDs as a solo artist. In 1982, The Uncle Floyd Show went into a small syndication circuit which included 17 markets, among them WNBC-TV channel 4 in New York, then WTAF-TV channel 29 in Philadelphia, WPWR-TV Channel 60 in Chicago and WSBK-TV Channel 38 in Boston. It aired right after SCTV on WNBC. The national syndication deal was seen as a huge step forward for the show, which up until that point could only be viewed in and around New Jersey and New York City on a single UHF channel and, at times, local cable. From 1983 to 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show ran on the statewide PBS network, NJN New Jersey Network, which consisted of 4 channels: WNJS (Channel 23, Camden), WNJN (Channel 50, Montclair), WNJB (Channel 58, New Brunswick) and WNJT (Channel 52, Trenton). Starting in late 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show was then seen on statewide cable channel CTN (\"The Cable Television Network Of New Jersey\").[2] During this time, the show went through various incarnations with Floyd sometimes hosting a music-only show, showcasing local bands. Floyd also hosted a show called Uncle Floyd's New Jersey, in which he would visit various towns and businesses in the state. First-run production of The Uncle Floyd Show ended in 1992, with CTN showing repeats until that channel's demise in 1999. In 1998, production of The Uncle Floyd Show began in the Cablevision studio in Oakland, New Jersey. One hundred shows were produced and aired on Cablevision systems throughout the region. Musical guests included Marky Ramone and The Misfits. Although viewer response was enthusiastic, the show was canceled by Cablevision management after the first cycle of episodes.", "otherInfo": "Join Uncle Floyd as he plays the piano and interacts with the audience and the Twin Door Tavern at the Maywood Inn in Maywood, NJ. \n\nEnjoy \"pianology\" at its finest, have some fine food and beverage, and experience a memorable evening with one of today's classic entertainers. \n\nReservations are recommended.

Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories. His most famous albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life. He has gradually become identified with progressive politics. He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.

Their mix of hook-filled retro pop and rock n roll jam brings fresh vibes to a classic familiar sound.

Their latest single, \u201cGolden Age,\u201d is the first track to come from their upcoming LP. Songwriter James Daniels wrote the song to reflect the rapid changes he was seeing in both society and his own life, caught in the middle between the nostalgic simplicity of youth and the new era that awaits. Chestnut Grove was formed by John Tyler, James Daniels, Sean Murray and Dee Gerhart in 2011 during their senior year of high school. The band\u2019s name was chosen in memory of would-be member and guitar player Matt Barber, who passed away tragically in a car accident in 2011 on Chestnut Grove Road. In 2015, members Dee, John, James, Zach Winkler, and Gary Geers, with the help of friend/engineer Owen McGreehan, released their self-produced album \u201cPerkiomenville\u201d to a sold-out hometown crowd at World Cafe Live in Philadelphia.

Teddy's style is difficult to categorize, because his influences are varied. Growing up around folk music, he listened to a musical gamut that covered Hank Williams, Jimi Hendrix, Sam Cooke and gospel. As he fell in with other musical progeny, most notably close friend Rufus Wainwright, his sound developed into his own combination of country/western, rock, and his father's folk-rock. Teddy played regular shows at Jon Brion's venue, Largo, in Los Angeles while getting his first album contract together. He signed with Geffen, who had big plans for him - but Geffen was soon after swallowed up by Virgin, who did not. Teddy's debut came out with little fanfare and less push from the label. He took a few years to tour and write before finally recording his second album on his own, and has been touring in support of that. While reviews for his first album were generally positive, the critics have gushed over his second album. Teddy has found his own sound and voice, although his family remains heavily involved in his music.

Dori Freeman was born and raised in the Appalachian community of Galax, Virginia. Dori's father, Scott Freeman, and her grandfather, Willard Gayheart, were veteran bluegrass musicians who played regularly and ran their own venue, Front Porch Gallery and Frame Shop. Dori picked up the guitar when she was 15 years old, and within a few years she was sharing the stage with the family band. After completing high school, Freeman attended Virginia Tech University, but she dropped out before graduating. By the time she was 22, Freeman was a single mother living with her folks, and she decided it was time she took her career seriously and put her talent to the test. Freeman started writing her own songs, and in 2011 she self-produced and released an album titled Porchlight. Along with Rufus Wainwright and Peggy Lee, Freeman has often cited singer and songwriter Teddy Thompson as one of her favorite artists, and in 2014 she sent him a message via Facebook along with a video of her performing her songs. To her surprise, Thompson replied three days later, saying he was impressed with the emotional honesty and strength of her songs and delivery, and wanted to produce an album for her. After bankrolling the project through a crowdfunding campaign, Thompson took Freeman into a studio in New York City, and three days later recording was completed. Including guest appearances from Aiofe O'Donovan of Crooked Still, Kacy & Clayton, and Teddy's father, Richard Thompson, Dori Freeman was released by Free Dirt Records in February 2016, and it soon earned a handful of rave reviews, with The New York Times declaring it one of the best albums of the year.

Nor are they about taking the past and reimagining it. No, what Tempt are doing is far more exciting and dynamic than such glib phrases would suggest. Welcome to thefuture of rock. A bold statement? Of course it is. But it also happens to be... TRUE! In the few years since their formation, Tempt have created a style, verve, vibe and quality that is of their own making. Here is what we have all craved and desired for so long. Namely, a band for the modern era who do not pander to trends. Nor are they dependent on their influences. No, here are four talents who meld and merge into something that is far more than the sum of those considerable parts. So, who are Tempt? They are vocalist Zach Allen, guitarist Harrison Marcello, bassist Chris Gooden and drummer Nick Burrows. Aside from Burrows, who comes from Windsor, Ontario, they all hail from New York. But in a way, their geographical location is irrelevant. Because what they have is a sound that appeals to a global community. What are they like? Firstly, the songs are sparklingly melodic. One listen and they stay firmly in the mind. Like so many greats from the '70s and '80s, what Tempt have already mastered is the ability to write and perform tunes which have an articulate simplicity, thereby ensuring the material is instant and memorable. However, what they also have is fluent, fluid and vibrant musicianship. And this has attained the highest possible level. But crucially, what Tempt do is tailor their virtuosity to ensure it always enhances the compositional structure. There are no outrageous solo excursions done for their own sake. Tempt are already doing, at such a young age, what defined the true giants of rock. Namely combining vast and diverse abilities to ensure that what you hear is charismatic, commanding and timeless. This music is not about superficial flamboyance, but depth and class. They showed their potential in 2016, with their debut album 'Runaway'. Now they have stepped up a level with their new album to be released in 2020. Onstage this band have already proven their pedigree both as club headliners and also supporting bands like Bon Jovi in arenas. Nothing phases them. You want supreme songwriting? Tempt have it. You want stunning performance? Tempt do this naturally. You want focused energy? Tempt deliver with flowing zest You want a rock band who pay respect to the past, yet are striding into the future? Tempt are that band. Welcome to the new world.

The lyrics come from the gut, but are still smart enough to avoid the usual Rock \u2018n Roll clich\u00e9s. They have been the opening act for legends such as Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins and Buzzcocks, to name a few. They have also amassed their own loyal following throughout the Mid-West and beyond.

Maybe it comes through in how she learned to read by pouring through lyric sheets and liner notes, or how she starting singing by belting along to U2 and Shania Twain in the back of her parents\u2019 car. Or maybe it will come to light in the thousands she\u2019s raised and the miles she\u2019s logged supporting the charitable initiatives she created while still a teenager. Or maybe it will simply come across in her stunning voice and wise, insightful lyricism, all infinitely beguiling for someone of her young age. But that\u2019s the thing about Townes. She\u2019s never operated by the clock or the calendar. She operates from her heart, and from her soul. The Canadian-born Townes, isn\u2019t quite like anyone else who has graced the city\u2019s stages. With the lyrical fortitude of Griffin or Lori McKenna, the soulful nature of Chris Stapleton or even Adele, Townes is paving ground all her own. Working on her debut LP with Jay Joyce, the Nashville-based Townes started her journey to becoming one of country\u2019s most promising new artists back in rural Canada, in the backseat of a car. \u201cI would obsess in the back seat over lyrics,\u201d says Townes, who recalls drives in her home of Grande Prairie, a small town in Alberta, Canada, with her parents. \u201cI would follow along to all of the words and sing along, and call out my favorites. Eventually, I started to learn all of the writer and producer names, just soaking it all up.\u201d Townes insisted that her parents \u2013 supportive, hard-working local entrepreneurs \u2013 sign her up for singing lessons at the age of five, which led to owning her first guitar from her grandparents at fourteen. It was perfect timing, as Townes had already started to explore what it would be like to set her poetry to music. While other kids were reading Shakespeare and studying, Townes added the craft of famed songwriters like Carolyn Dawn Johnson to her workload, developing her own narrative style before most other teenagers even headed to prom. \u201cThere were a lot of things to write about at fourteen,\u201d Townes says. \u201cI\u2019ve always craved what it felt like to step into other people\u2019s shoes. And if songwriting was a way to step into character and make someone feel less alone, then I was all in.\u201d It\u2019s telling that Townes\u2019 first song came from a conversation in social studies class \u2013 she thought about it on the entire bus ride home and hurried to her bedroom to put her feeling to words. Ever since then, so many of her lyrics have come from that place of empathy and observance \u2013 a few years later, moments she\u2019s seen in passing or discussed at the dinner table with her family or wept about alongside strangers have worked their way into her sonic perspectives. Soon, she was traveling to Nashville regularly to exercise this developing talent and falling in love with everything Music City had to offer. \u201cComing here for the first time felt like walking into a dreamland,\u201d she says. She made the move to Nashville permanently four years ago, at just nineteen \u2013 driving 45 hours from Grande Prairie. Once settled in Nashville, Townes spent her days songwriting and her nights at guitar pulls or at the Bluebird, studying everything she could. Eventually, she scored a publishing deal with Big Yellow Dog, and headed into the studio with Joyce to record her debut. Together, they tapped into her organic nature and her sheer ability to tell a story and emote it through the visceral range of her vocals \u2013 tender, bluesy, wise and full of wonder but never naive. \u201cHe has a way of pulling out people\u2019s most honest self,\u201d says Townes of her experience working with Joyce. \u201cI always loved telling stories and writing songs, and a lot of these songs deal with things that are hard to talk about. Concepts about losing someone and asking hard questions and about seeking whatever your sense of faith is. Songs about looking for love.\u201d Songs, most importantly, from the heart. And that\u2019s because Townes\u2019 heart is huge. At fifteen, she organized a fundraiser called Big Hearts For Big Kids benefiting a youth shelter in her home town. To this day, they\u2019ve continued it yearly and raised over $1.5 million dollars \u2013 Townes was inspired to start the event by a pamphlet her mother brought home one day, not an uncommon occurrence at her house. \u201cWe\u2019d sit around the dinner table and talk about what was going on in the world, homelessness and loneliness,\u201d she says, \u201cand I grew up being aware of those things. The parts of human existence that remind us we are all more similar than we think we are. And those stories need to be told.\u201d After school, she continued this ethos by launching a tour called Play It Forward, where she spent 32 weeks on the road, visiting 106 schools and playing music for over 35,000 students.

Trap Montego and Empress Natiya are 9keyzz; athletic musicians who take music as seriously as the NBA as they are a team of dedicated MVP players making a commitment to act as one. The multitalented entertainers aspire to top charts and move the world with their fusion of sound as they have big plans to release an album that\u2019s on the level of Michael Jackson\u2019s 1982 bestseller, \u2018Thriller'. While they are strong together, each member of 9keyzz has had their own journey to get to where they needed to be to connect in NYC. Born Scean Gordon on October 1, 1986 at The University of W.I in Kingston, Jamaica, Trap Montego discovered his love of music early in life. From his days singing in church to carrying tunes with his grandfather, James Lindsay, he\u2019s always known music was the path he was meant to follow. And follow it he did, all the way from Jamaica to the Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences in Arizona in 2012. There he learned everything from recording engineering to film directing. His partner in sound Natoya Johnson, known professionally as Empress Natiya, came into this world at home in Newground District, Clarendon Jamaica W.I on October 30, 1983.She too got her start in the church. It awoke a passion in her and from there she began writing songs. As she got older and more involved in the reggae culture - her musical passion continued to thrive, along with comedy and acting. Both of which she shined in, but today her focus is on making 9keyzz a household name. They both took different routes to get to where they needed to be and it led both of them to New York City. Empress Natiya had spent years trying to make it, took a break to farm, and then returned to the inspiration of Scean. They met soon after Trap had taken a break from his classes at Full Sail due to the loss of a beloved family member. In need of some space, he turned to music and standing there was not only his first love but Empress Natiya. Fast forward to 2018 and the two had discovered the magic they could create with one another; 9Keyzz was born. Since then they\u2019ve worked day and night to make their presence known. With spins on both internet and local radio for their hip hop meets reggae style, songs like \u201cNo Competition\u201d and \u201cLottery\u201d have proven to be fire. Now they\u2019re preparing for the next big step in their career; a Caribbean & Reggae Tour starting in the summer of 2020. They\u2019ll be performing the newest single, \u201cLit Life,\u201d off their May 2020 album \u2018Harder Than Ever Before\u2019 and more.

Clifford was coping with the recent death of a parent and a divorce when the global pandemic hit. Quarantined in his Brooklyn apartment, On a Saturday Night, a record about loss, acceptance and salvation, was born. Though Clifford played in various bands in college and after, he put aspirations of a touring career on the shelf. He became a music teacher at an inner city elementary school and shared his passion for creativity and songwriting with his students. After his mom passed away and his marriage ended, Clifford fell into a depression. \u201cI started dozens of songs, just trying to process what I\u2019d been through, but I couldn\u2019t finish anything. So I went on different medications, got into therapy, researched Buddhism and meditated, sometimes for hours a day.\u201c Once the fog began to lift, new ideas came quickly. After going through old demos to reignite his love for songwriting, Clifford came across an unfinished song called \u201cKick the Drum.\u201d The lyrics spoke of the joys of making music with friends and raising a glass as a way of dispensing with hard times, if only for the evening. It was in part a love song for the Brooklyn bluegrass community Clifford found at its spiritual headquarters, Sunnys Bar, located on the outskirts of Red Hook. \u201cI wandered into the back room of this old bar on a Saturday night and was blown away by the incredible scene there. The line between the audience and the performers blurred into one messy, glorious wash of sound.\u201d Clifford spent countless hours digging into the repertoire, pouring over recordings by Norman Blake, Bill Monroe and The Stanley Brothers. Soon he was hosting his own jams. From there, he took his new found love of bluegrass and started teaching the next generation of bluegrassers at The Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. By July of 2020, Clifford had enough material for a record. On A Saturday Night was recorded at The Bunker Studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Masked up and sanitized, the bluegrass community that lifted Clifford back up on his feet was now helping him put down roots in the genre that he credits with helping him through some very dark times. Co-Produced by Clifford, Ron Pope, and Nicole Cosme, the tracks range from traditional bluegrass romps to delicate and sparse ballads with introspective lyrics. The songs address his personal struggles head on, eventually finding some much needed closure and acceptance. It wasn\u2019t the first time music was Clifford\u2019s saving grace. \u201cAs a kid I was diagnosed with ADD, OCD and a handful of other acronyms. I had few friends and did terribly in school.\u201d When he was nine years old, Clifford fell in love with Guns N\u2019 Roses and started playing the drums. Music became an outlet and a way of connecting with other like minded people. Clifford\u2019s tastes changed as songwriting became his passion. He absorbed soul, folk, and jazz and released a debut record with songs about love, lust, God and existential dread. When his mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, Clifford found himself leaning on music once again. \u201cAfter my mom was diagnosed, she worked as a nurse in a hospice facility. That just blew me away. She was in a lot of pain and dealt with it by easing the suffering of other people. She also encouraged me to use my music in more explicitly therapeutic settings.\u201d In 2018 Clifford started volunteering with Musicians On Call, a program that brought live music to hospital patients. \u201cOf all the musical experiences I\u2019ve had, nothing has compared to what I\u2019ve shared with people in their most vulnerable moments. I left every volunteer session feeling this incredible awe at the ability of music to bring healing to people.\u201d For all of the bad the pandemic brought, it allowed Clifford to start processing painful emotions and memories, distilling them into songs infused with the rhythms and unapologetic vulnerability of bluegrass and old folk songs. Everything came full-circle: things had to fall apart before they could be rebuilt. On a Saturday Night will be released in August 2021.", "otherInfo": "Full band show at this dope brewery in Jersey City!"}, {"Address": "Hilton Fashion District Hotel, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Svetlana ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9301408.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7455256, -73.9937621], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Sophisti-pop, Swing, Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Chelsea Table & Stage", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102768641-svetlana-at-chelsea-table-and-stage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "\"Breakfast at Tiffany's Meets Some Like It Hot\" (Lucid Culture) \"Outstanding vocalist\" (Wall Street Journal)", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "185 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Sahara Moon ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7219949, -73.9883827], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022533981-sahara-moon-at-rockwood-music-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Sahara Moon"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Eleanor Buckland ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11515243.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223225, -73.98858129999999], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Americana, Indie Rock, Indie Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022657198-eleanor-buckland-at-rockwood-music-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Elizabeth and The Catapult w/ Eleanor Buckland"}, {"Address": "601 Main St, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Bikini Trill ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8787181.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.2191008, -74.0126125], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Surf-pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Saint", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022717292-bikini-trill-at-the-saint?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Bikini Trill is a surf-pop trio from Los Angeles, CA.

Now he is launching a solo project that reimagines Sikh kirtan with boundary-defying Punjabi anthems to uplift & ignite. Sonny's first musical outlet as a child of immigrant parents in North Carolina was singing Sikh devotional music in gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship). His energy shifted to other types of music as he became a more serious musician: ska, reggae, funk, punk rock, bhangra, and more. In 2003, Sonny co-founded the political rock band Outernational and recorded an album produced by Tom Morello. As a singer and trumpet player, he has been central to the sound and raw energy of Red Baraat since the band's inception in 2008, touring globally and recording 5 studio albums. Sonny is currently finishing his debut solo album, produced by Wil-Dog Abers of Ozomatli, entitled Chardi Kala, the Sikh concept of revolutionary eternal optimism. His first single, Mitar Pyare Nu, premiered on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered and Rolling Stone India. Sonny\u2019s music is a reminder that hope, love, and devotion are crucial to our struggles and our collective survival. Chardi Kala is a return to Sonny\u2019s Punjabi & Sikh roots, but with the lens he\u2019s developed over the course of his life as a touring musician, educator, and activist. Musically, the project embodies the many spiritual, political, and aesthetic elements that have shaped Sonny: a bolero-mariachi Sikh shabad on one track, a qawwali song with a reggae bass line on another, a bombastic Ghadar Party tribute in Punjabi and Spanish on yet another. His live band, which includes harmonium, electric guitar, tabla, and drumset, provides listeners with an experience of both introspective reflection and fervent urgency.", "otherInfo": "Sonny Singh + Ernest Stuart will be bringing some dhol & trombone energy to support Felicia Singh's campaign for City Council in NYC."}, {"Address": "173 Morgan Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Brendan Kelly ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7101142, -73.9336187], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Arrogant Swine", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022081519-brendan-kelly-at-arrogant-swine?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave #1, Brooklyn, NY 11237, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Kississippi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11373310.jpeg", "Coordinates": ["", ""], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "Dream Pop, Indie Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Rooftop", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022143216-kississippi-at-elsewhere-rooftop?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Kississippi began as a mystery, the band garnering quick Internet acclaim with the 2014 digital release of a collection of demos.

Ball, the 2018 Texas State Musician Of The Year, has won worldwide fame and countless fans for her ability to ignite a full-scale roadhouse party every time she takes the stage. Born in Orange, Texas and raised in Vinton, Louisiana, her deep Acadian heritage and a lifetime of absorbing Gulf Coast rhythm and blues is evident in her original songs and the classics she chooses to cover. This has made her a one-of-a-kind favorite with music lovers all over the world. With each new release, her reputation as a profoundly soulful singer, a boundlessly talented pianist and a courageous, inventive songwriter continues to grow. Her love of the road has led to years of soul-satisfying performances at festivals, concert halls and clubs. In Marcia\u2019s most recent album, Shine Bright, she has put together the most musically substantial, hopeful and uplifting set of songs of her five-decade career. Produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and recorded in Texas and Louisiana, Shine Bright contains twelve songs (including eight originals), ranging from the title track\u2019s rousing appeal for public and private acts of courage to the upbeat call to action of Pots And Pans, a song inspired by renowned Texas political writer and humorist Molly Ivins. From the humorous advice of Life Of The Party to the poignantly optimistic World Full Of Love, the intensity of Ball\u2019s conviction never wavers while, simultaneously, the fun never stops. \u201cIt is a ridiculously hopeful, cheerful record,\u201d she says, in light of some of the album\u2019s more serious subject matter. The secret, according to Ball \u201cis to set the political songs to a good dance beat.\u201d Marcia grew up in a family whose female members all played piano and she began taking lessons at age five, playing old Tin Pan Alley and popular music tunes from her grandmother\u2019s collection. But it wasn\u2019t until she was 13 that Marcia discovered the power of soul music. One day in 1962, she sat amazed as Irma Thomas performed on a show at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans and delivered the most spirited and moving performance the young teenager had ever seen. A few years later she attended Louisiana State University and after dropping out to explore the brave new hippie world of the late 1960s, she was invited to try out for a blues-based rock band called Gum. She made the cut and her future was set. In 1970, Ball left Baton Rouge for San Francisco. Her car broke down in Austin, and while waiting for repairs she fell in love with the city and decided to stay. It wasn\u2019t long before she was performing in local clubs with a band called Freda And The Firedogs, a group that pioneered the Progressive Country movement, which attracted many musicians and significant media attention to Austin. It was around this time that she discovered Professor Longhair, the seminal New Orleans piano player. \u201cOnce I found out about Professor Longhair,\u201d recalls Ball, \u201cI knew I had found my direction.\u201d When Freda And The Firedogs broke up in 1974, Ball launched her solo career and began touring outside of Texas and Louisiana. She signed with Capitol Records in 1977, debuting with the country-rock album Circuit Queen. As she created and honed her own sound, she released six critically acclaimed titles on the Rounder Records label during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Ball\u2014collaborating with Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton\u2014recorded the hugely successful Dreams Come True on the Antone\u2019s label. At the end of 1997, Marcia finished work on a similar \u201cthree divas of the blues\u201d project for Rounder, this time in the distinguished company of Tracy Nelson and her longtime inspiration, Irma Thomas. The CD, Sing It!, was released in 1998 and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Marcia Ball has appeared many times on national television over the years, including the PBS special In Performance At The White House along with B.B. King and Della Reese, Austin City Limits and HBO's Treme. She performed in Piano Blues, the film directed by Clint Eastwood included in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Blues series which aired on PBS television nationwide in 2003. Marcia also appeared on The Late Show With David Letterman with The New Orleans Social Club, where she not only reached millions of people, but also helped to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2012, she had a role in the independent film Angels Sing starring Harry Connick, Jr., Lyle Lovett and Willie Nelson. In 2017 she performed on NPR\u2019s A Jazz Piano Christmas, live from The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Ball joined Alligator Records in 2001 with the release of the critically acclaimed Presumed Innocent. The CD won the 2002 Blues Music Award for Blues Album Of The Year. Her follow-up, So Many Rivers, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and won the 2004 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year as well as the coveted Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year award. Her next release, Live! Down The Road, released in 2005, also garnered a Grammy nomination, as did 2008\u2019s Peace, Love & BBQ (the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart). She holds eleven Blues Music Awards, ten Living Blues Awards, and five Grammy Award nominations. 2010\u2019s Grammy-nominated Roadside Attractions and 2014\u2019s The Tattooed Lady And The Alligator Man successfully grew her fan base even further. She has been inducted into both the Gulf Coast Music Hall Of Fame and the Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame. The Texas State legislature named her the official 2018 Texas State Musician. In 2018, Marcia was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. Since March of 2020 and the onset of the COVID pandemic and subsequent lock-down, Marcia has filled her time with work on a nonprofit organization she co-founded called HOME \u2013 Housing Opportunities for Musicians and Entertainers, which pays rent and utilities for older musicians in the Austin area (HOMEaustin.org). She also improved her streaming and virtual performance abilities enough to participate in many on-line fundraising efforts throughout the year. She put her domestic skills to work making masks. She and her husband Gordon got a dog to replace their dear Lily. She has written songs and she is collaborating on a musical play which she hopes becomes a real live show in the near future. And she\u2019s getting the band ready to get back out on the road. \u201cI still love the feel of the wheels rolling,\u201d she says, \u201cand the energy in a room full of people ready to go wherever it is we take them.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Frenchkiss Records ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6946126.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6737185, -73.9916803], "Date": "2021-08-19", "EventDate": "Aug. 19th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Valley Maker at The Bell House", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102629511-frenchkiss-records-at-the-bell-house?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "New York based record label founded by Les Savy Fav bassist Syd Butler in 1999.

Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, the Rat Pack, Dick Clark, Chubby Checker, they all made stops on the Jersey Shore. Tony Mart\u2019s was the club Levon Helm was playing when Dylan called. Of course we all know what happened in Asbury Park. The town, ravaged by riots in the late 60\u2019s, became a melting pot of musical experimentation. Late night jams that ended when the sun came up were the norm. Bruce Springsteen & Southside Johnny were the two acts that made their way to an international stage from these humble beginnings. For decades musicians have come and gone, always hoping to make a living and pursue a dream. Billy Walton is no different. Billy\u2019s proving ground was Long Beach Island. There he was chaperoned from gig to gig by his Mom, two young to drive around and enter the clubs on his own. He always was up for a jam and looking to learn some tricks. For years Billy spent his time sharpening his skills, developing his stage act until he decided to step up to center stage with the Billy Walton Band. The band has focused its\u2019 effort in Europe. 13 tours since 2007 have established the group in the fertile British Blues Rock scene. In 2010 Billy got the call to join in with one of the masters of the Asbury Park sound, Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes. For years Billy toured with the Jukes. Most people don\u2019t know that the creative force behind Southside was none other than Little Steven. A highpoint in Billy\u2019s tenure with the Jukes was when they recorded a live version of Southside\u2019s most acclaimed release, Hearts of Stone, with Little Steven. Good things have been happening to the Billy Walton Band. The band recently signed to Vizztone Records for the release of Wish For What You Want. Produced by Tony Braunagel, the award winning BMA producer and current Eric Burdon drummer, this batch of songs will certainly take the band to the next level! You can say Bruce Springsteen is a singer songwriter fronting an old-school rock n soul band. Southside Johnny is a soul singer fronting an old-school rock n soul band.

The band formed in 1992 with the name Shrinky Dinx, later changing it to Sugar Ray after the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. Their debut album, Lemonade and Brownies, was released in 1995, though it failed to produce a major hit. Their early work was strongly influenced by funk metal, punk, alternative rock and straight up R&B, not a particularly fashionable combination at the time. Sugar Ray's first mainstream hit came in the summer of 1997 with their song \"Fly\", which was released on the album Floored and featured notable reggae artist Super Cat. \"Fly\" was notable for not sounding anything at all like the rest of the tracks on the album and received frequent (some called it \"constant\") radio play. As a result of the success of \"Fly\", Floored sold extremely well and was certified double platinum. However, by the end of 1997, critics skeptical that Sugar Ray could put out another successful song labeled them a one-hit wonder. Their 1999 album 14:59 was the sardonic reply to these accusations, with the title implying that their fifteen minutes of fame were not quite up\u2014their \"fame clock\" reading 14:59. \"Every Morning\", which received widespread comparisons to \"Fly\", rose to similar success in late 1998. Their follow-up single \"Someday\" received extensive airplay during 1999 as well. This album, which outsold its predecessor and was certified triple platinum, proved that Sugar Ray was not a one-hit wonder after all. Sugar Ray was also set to play at Woodstock '99, but had to cancel due to illness. Their 2001 self-titled album Sugar Ray produced another hit with \"When It's Over\" and reached the same level as their previous singles. Sugar Ray's 2003 effort In the Pursuit of Leisure, and the first single from that album, \"Mr. Bartender (It's So Easy)\" received a lukewarm reception. In 2005, Sugar Ray released a greatest hits album, with two new songs, including the single \"Shot of Laughter\".", "otherInfo": "Concert in front of Union County Performing Arts Center.

Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered around his native New Jersey. Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories. His most famous albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life. He has gradually become identified with progressive politics. He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.

As a composer, multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and unique interpreter of the jazz tradition, she is quickly becoming one of the standard bearers for the form, making a considerable and dynamic contribution to the legacy of jazz while paying tribute to its heroes. Fluid and powerful on the tenor saxophone and highly inventive as a vocalist, she also plays bass clarinet, flute, and piccolo. Her rich sax sound has been compared to Joe Henderson and Dexter Gordon, while her vocal approach\u2014including an impressive scatting ability\u2014has been classified alongside those of Ella Fitzgerald and Betty Carter. In a few short years, Thurman has shared stages with such jazz and R&B luminaries as George Coleman, Roy Haynes, Dianne Reeves, Wynton Marsalis, The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JALCO) featuring Wynton Marsalis, Kenny Barron, Buster Williams, Charles Tolliver, Jack DeJohnette, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Terri Lyne Carrington, Jon Hendricks, Harry Connick Jr., Jon Batiste, Audra MacDonald, Diana Krall, Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight, Chaka Khan, Louis Hayes, Russell Malone, Nicholas Payton, Jacky Terrasson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Alicia Keys, Lalah Hathaway, Jill Scott and Erykah Badu, among others. The New York City native has already amassed several distinctive honors for her musicianship: runner up in the 2013 Sarah Vaughan International Vocal Competition, two-time winner of the ASCAP Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composers Award and a winner of the Fulbright Scholars Cultural Ambassador Grant, The Chamber Music of America Performance Plus Grant (Sponsored by the Dorris Duke Charitable Foundation) and the Jazz Coalition Composers Grant among others. Thurman also has four full-length recordings as a leader to her credit. Her compositions were featured and performed by her quartet in the ASCAP/The Kennedy Center \u201cSongwriters: The Next Generation\u201d showcase as well as the Greenwich School of Music \u201cUncharted\u201d Series. Camille has appeared on BET\u2019s \u201cBlack Girls Rock\u201d as the saxophonist and flutist in the All-Star Band. Equally adept as a player and a singer, and recognized for her compositional abilities as well, Thurman has also earned accolades from the media, from Jazz Times to Downbeat, All About Jazz to the New York Times, NPR to Sirius XM Satellite Radio, BET to Jazz Night In America. Thurman toured internationally toured two seasons withe the world-renowned Jazz At Lincoln Center with Wynton Marsalis as a saxophonist, becoming the first woman in 30 years to tour and perform full time (2018-2020). After guesting with the JALCO on several shows, including a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, and again during the 2017-2018 season as a featured vocalist for the world premiere of the historic work, \u201cThe Every Fonky Lowdown,\u201d Thurman was invited to play the tenor saxophone chair for the past two seasons, which covered four continents. When she is not touring with the JALCO, Thurman is on the road leading her band, The Camille Thurman Quartet. She is also a featured artist with the Darrell Green Trio, where she has performed at the Kennedy Center, Alice Tully Hall, and numerous respected international jazz festivals and venues. Thurman was chosen by the State Department under the Fulbright Scholarship grant to perform in Paraguay and Nicaragua with her band.

Near the end of the decade, Curtis stated a notable YouTube series called \u201cOne Man Band,\u201d where he covered classic rock songs, performing all the instruments himself (guitar, bass, keyboards, drums and vocals). In 2010, JT Curtis produced his first solo release, the funky rocking MAKE IT TO THE BRIDGE / THE UNCIVILIZED CITY. With provocative lyrics and intense gut-grabbing music, this single is a must-have! Unable to clone himself for live performances, Curtis formed his own band, Mad Mongoose, collaborating with New York's top musicians (Arthur Migliazza, Darcy MacRae, Tetsuya Sato, and others). The band uploaded a live performance of the Curtis penned funk-rock tune, \u201cShake it Off,\u201d featuring Curtis\u2019 masterful slide work and Migliazza\u2019s dynamic piano playing. \u201cShake it Off\u201d became am irresistible fan favorite, leading Curtis to officially release the song in 2013, backed with another original tune, \u201cNo Room to Move.\u201d Beginning 2015, JT Curtis began hosting a YouTube series called \u201cThe History of Rock & Roll\u201d discussing the genera\u2019s history decade by decade, with a little help from his friend Nick Patrella. Curtis has backed up many powerful artists and groups. In 2013, he was a featured performer in the Broadway musical LET IT BE.

He currently resides in Brooklyn, NY. Best known for being one-half of Quincy Vidal, a New York based boom-bap jazz/hip hop project, CE has been writing and producing music for upwards of 10 years. Coping with the slow & painful loss of his father to Alzheimer's, while subsequently ending a four year relationship with the love of his life, his first official solo project takes us deeper into the explorations of his guarded subconscious. Weaving together hauntingly-smooth melodies, dark production, and viscerally raw verses, CE cross-breeds familiar genres in ways that are unexpected and sophisticated. The lush, yet unsettling, sonic environments of his songs create a platform for his words, which are sung and rapped without inhibition. Drawing inspiration from Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, and James Blake, CE is a progressive musician. Majestic, head-bobbing electronic beats can make the small Greenpoint bedroom where he writes/produces feel like a stadium. His lyrics, packed with relatable struggles and anthemic quotables, allow listeners rhythmic access to his complex mind. However, his inherent knowledge of \"the classics\" remain, making room for his gospel/folk roots to shine - ultimately coating every single song with a crisp, sexy, addictive, heart-wrenching layer of soulful melody. \"My audience is my therapist\", says CE. But the reverse is also true; while traveling with him, we travel within ourselves.

It just doesn\u2019t sound like it.\u201d This is how virtuoso guitarist Oz Noy describes his intoxicating blend of jazz, funk, rock, blues, and r&b. Born in Israel, Oz started his professional career at the age of 13 playing jazz, blues, pop and rock music. By age 16, he was playing with top Israeli musicians and artists. By age 24, he was one of the most established studio guitar players in the country. Oz was also a member of the house band on Israel\u2019s top-rated television show for more than two years. Since his 1996 arrival in New York, Oz has made a huge impact on the local and international music scene. His unique and intoxicating style has broken all the rules of instrumental guitar music by focusing on the groove. All stars such as Keith Carlock, Anton Fig, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Dave Weckl often contribute on drums, with bassists Will Lee, James Genus, and Reggie Washington. In 2003, Oz released his debut record \u2013 \u201cOz Live\u201d \u2013 recorded at NYC\u2019s legendary Bitter End. In 2004, Oz signed with Magna Carta Records and in 2005, released his highly-acclaimed studio record \u201cHA!\u201d with his all-star band featuring Fig, Carlock, Lee and Genus plus special guests Mike Stern and George Whitty. In April of 2007, a licensing deal with Magna Carta and Japanese label Videoarts opened the door for Oz's music in Japan. Later that year saw the release of \u201cFuzzy Feat,\u201d Oz\u2019s third record under the Magna Carta label. For Fuzzy Feat, Oz\u2019s all-star band is joined by various special guests including Colaiuta, bassist Jimmy Johnson, and keyboardists Whitty and Jim Beard. September 2009 saw the release of Oz\u2019s fourth album, \u201cSchizophrenic,\u201d featuring Lee, Fig, Carlock, Weckl, Ricky Peterson, Chris Palmero, and special guest Steve Lukather. November 2011 Oz released his fifth studio album \u201cTwisted Blues\u201d Featuring Vinnie Coliauta, Anton Fig, Chris Layton, Will Lee, Roscoe Beck , John Medeski, Jerry Z, Reese Wynans, Ralph Macdonald and special guests Eric Johnson & Allen Toussaint. In late 2012 Oz released his two highly acclaimed instructional DVD's,\"Guitar Improvisational Workout\" and \"Play Along Workout\", released by jazzheaven.com . For his accomplishments as a trend-setting guitarist, Oz won the highly acclaimed Guitar Player magazine readers poll for \u201cBest guitar riff on a record\u201d in 2007, \u201cBest new talent\u201d in 2008, and \"Best out there guitar player\" in 2013.

Diamond J, DJ K La Boss, and later DJ Scratch were DJs for the group. The duo split by January of 1993, under controversial circumstances. According to interviews in The Source and Rap Pages, in late 1991, Smith\u2019s house was burgled by armed intruders.

But in a genre currently dominated by flat brims and ball caps, you\u2019ll find Jacob Rice strumming on your heart strings. Coming from the town of Wallingford, Vermont with a mere 2000 residents, Rice was raised stacking the wood stove, enjoying the great outdoors, and writing his songs by the river. Like the sap from the maple trees, his sweet songs are taken straight from the heart. Rice\u2019s hybrid country sound transcends genre to deliver an authentic experience driven by heartfelt lyrics and a soulful, passionate vocal. His current release, Way You Were Loving Me, brings a timeless, refreshing take on the current country sound. He has had the honor of being produced by Chad Cromwell (Anders Osbourne, Joe Walsh, Neil Young) and Paul Worley (Lady A, The Chicks, Martina McBride) for an upcoming project. Rice was also chosen by the prestigious Bluebird Cafe and Taylor Guitars as their January 2021 Golden Pick. Rice has been featured on Spotify\u2019s \u201cNew Music Nashville\u201d, Vermont Public Radio, and 101.5 WEXP Vermont Community Radio. All of these accomplishments are a testament to Rice\u2019s hard work and dedication to making great, lasting music.

Nick and Brianna Chiapparino grew up singing together in the suburbs of Westchester, New York. The duo has fronted many bands spanning a wide variety of genres but for the first time, with Plane Station, are settling into the music they feel most at home with. Honing their craft through years of live performance, Nick and Brianna build their sound on an ability to write collaboratively and harmonize with one another that is, at this point, second nature. Their first album, The Other Side, finds the duo exploring themes of love, change and loss in a stripped down, predominantly acoustic setting. However, Plane Station is not averse to the grandiose and often stretch their acoustic sound into soaring harmonies and swelling instrumentation. This is evident not only in their sprawling live shows, which often feature drummer and producer Jesse Melito, but their two latest singles, Alcohol and Francis. Both of which tease Nick and Brianna\u2019s growth towards a more expansive sonic landscape on their upcoming LP, 7th Street.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "73 Market Street, Yonkers, NY 10710", "Artist": "Chris Bergson Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11037967.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.9627503, -73.8564249], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Chris Bergson Band feat.

He describes the streetscapes and nightscapes of city life, painting small, memorable pictures, a kind of Edward Hopper of the blues. Bergson doesn't do predictable, but there's a visible thread of blues awareness running through the fabric of everything he writes, sings and plays: he is a concise and subtle guitarist and tough, grainy singer.\" The Blues Magazine (UK) With MOJO Magazine's #1 Blues Album of 2008, Fall Changes, #2 Blues Album of 2011, Imitate the Sun, #3 Blues Album of 2014, Live at Jazz Standard and #3 Blues Album of 2017, Bitter Midnight , New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson has established himself as \"one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music\" (All Music Guide), creating his own blend of blues, roots and soul. Chris Bergson has performed and/or shared the stage with Hubert Sumlin, Levon Helm, B.B. King, Norah Jones, John Hammond, Etta James, and Bettye LaVette, to name just a few. 2014 CD RELEASE: LIVE AT JAZZ STANDARD LABEL: 2 SHIRTS / INNSBRUCK RECORDS MEDIA Live at Jazz Standard, the latest CD release from the Chris Bergson Band, was recorded live over two nights at NYC's Jazz Standard with Bergson's usual four-piece band (organ/wurlitzer, bass and drums) \"augmented with a horn section expert in the snap and crackle of bluesy soul.\" (The Blues Magazine UK) The fifteen song CD contains eight brand new original songs from New York guitarist/singer Chris Bergson \"...one of the most inventive songwriters in modern blues music.\" (All Music Guide) as well as new arrangements of five older originals from the band's back catalog. According to iTunes Editors' Notes: \"A fair number of hot shot guitarists can lay down licks with presence and panache, but that number shrinks drastically when you tally the ones who are also sharp-shooting singer/songwriters. That\u00eds what makes Chris Bergson an unusual triple threat and this live recording shines a spotlight on the strength of his material as well as the alternately simmering and fiery feel that he and his band serve up in a club setting. New York City native Chris Bergson is a bluesman of a distinctly urban stripe. Instead of swamps and rivers, his songs - many penned in collaboration with lyricist Kate Ross - are full of citified imagery from the midtown Manhattan locale of \"61st & 1st\" to the Brooklyn scenes of \"Gowanus Heights.\" The three-man horn section accentuates the soul leanings of tunes like \"The Only One\" and brings out the R&B shadings in Bergson's gritty growl. At times, the blend of Bergson's earthy vocals and terse, biting guitar with Craig Dreyer's organ evokes The Band. Yet whether the guitarist and his group are venturing into R&B, roots rock or straight blues, they create an invitingly organic feel on a recording that clearly captures the band in their element.\" Special guests include soul singer Ellis Hooks and a three piece horn section featuring baritone saxophonist Ian Hendrickson-Smith (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), tenor saxophonist David Luther (Bettye LaVette) and Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Freddie Hendrix performing horn arrangements by Jay Collins (Gregg Allman). Jazz Standard has been a musical home for the Chris Bergson Band for the past ten years and provided an ideal venue for their first live record. The album was recorded and co-produced by award-winning producer/engineer Roman Klun whose credits include albums by the Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne and the Holmes Brothers. Bergson has had the opportunity to play with two masters of American music - drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band and Howlin' Wolf's guitarist Hubert Sumlin - and their influence can be heard throughout the album. Notable past performances include: Moulin Blues (Holland), Groningen Rhythm and Blues Night (Holland), Blues Open (Holland), Noct en Blues (Chaumont, France), Blues in Hell (Norway), Harvest Time Blues (Ireland), Leicester Blues Festival (UK), Waterfront Blues Festival (Portland, OR), Saratoga Jazz Festival (NY), Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles (Woodstock, NY), River to River Festival (NYC), Joe\u2019s Pub (NYC), The Blue Note (NYC), Jazz Standard (NYC), John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (DC), SXSW, and opening for B.B. King at B.B. King's Blues Club (NYC). Born in New York City but raised in Somerville, Massachusetts, Chris Bergson returned to Manhattan in 1995. While backing jazz singers Annie Ross, Dena DeRose, Sasha Dobson and Norah Jones, he released Blues for Some Friends of Mine and Wait for Spring on Juniper Records in 1997 and 2000, respectively. In 2002 Bergson was appointed a Jazz Ambassador of the USA by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and he toured Africa with his trio. Evolving to further embrace the blues while also adding pop influences, he followed up with Blues (2003), Another Day (2005) and his triumphant artistic breakthrough, the widely acclaimed Fall Changes (2007) -- MOJO\u2019s #1 Blues Album of 2008 -- that established him as an eloquent, evocative and lyrical songwriter with a sharp urban vision. Recorded at Levon Helm\u2019s Woodstock studio, it led to Bergson being personally invited to perform at the famed drummer\u2019s Midnight Rambles while opening the way for more stateside festivals and subsequent tours of Europe.

Every kind of metal you could think of you will find in their music. No matter if its Thrash, Doom, Power, Progressive or Death or traditional Heavy Metal, in PATHOS you'll find it. The name of PATHOS came from an instrumental tune written by Lennart Specht in the early nineties. The song & the band was originally called Depict Pathos. The band wanted a name that could describe emotions in one way or another. This name seamed to fit the varying type of music that the band started to play in May 1995. In the autumn 1995 PATHOS recorded a five-track demo tape in a small studio in their home- town Trollh\u00e4ttan in Sweden. About the same time Stefan Carlsson, at that point singing with Neocori & Memento Mori, joined the band. In 96 the band came in touch with Liphone Metal when they were about to record their second demo tape. The songs made a big impression on B\u00f6rje Lindqvist manager at Liphone Metal, who wanted to put the song Hoverface on a compilation album. Later the same year PATHOS signed with LIPHONE METAL. The album \"Hoverface\" was recorded at Lirec studios in Uddevalla Sweden 1997. Later the same year BLACK MARK Productions signed the band and made a new front cover for the album and then they re-released it. The 23:d of March 1998 PATHOS started the work with their second studio album that they called \"Uni versus Universe\" and by the time that the album was recorded PATHOS decided to split with BLACK MARK. In September 1998 PATHOS released the album through LIPHONE METAL in Sweden exclusively. In December 1999 PATHOS played their last gigs with singer Stefan Carlsson who left the band (for personal reasons) early 2000 and Pathos spent 6 months searching for a new singer. When summer came Paul Sch\u00f6ning joined the band and PATHOS started the work with a seven track \"demo\" that was recorded a weekend in August in Gothenburg. In 2001 Pathos signed a deal with RoastingHouse Productions in Malm\u00f6 Sweden. In February 2002 Pathos together with producer Anders \"Theo\" Theander (Majestic, Pain of Salvation, Last Tribe, Midnight Sun etc), recorded and produced the album \"Katharsis\", and made it the bands greatest achievement so far. Great sound, good songs and an astonishing cover designed by Niklas Sundin The members from Pathos can also be found in various other project bands. Daniel Antonsson plays in a melodic death-metal band called Dimension Zero with members from In Flames amongst others, and in a Cosmic Doom Boogie band called Elecxsir, Thomas Antonsson & Esko Salow plays together in a Power/Speed-metal act called Nostradameus and a Swedish folk music band called Fejd, Lennart Specht plays in Fejd together with Esko and Thomas, Paul Sch\u00f6ning has a project called Power Plant, and some singer/songwriter projects.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "123-01 Roosevelt Ave, Flushing, NY 11368", "Artist": "Oteil Burbridge ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11537382.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7564124, -73.84589369999999], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "Southern Rock, Blues-rock, Rock, Free Funk, Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Citi Field", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102708530-oteil-burbridge-at-citi-field?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Two-time Grammy winning bassist Oteil Burbridge has been in the music business touring and recording for over three decades. His first step into the national spotlight came in 1991 when he became a founding member of the Aquarium Rescue Unit featuring Col. Bruce Hampton, a cult classic that has stood the test of time. That led to his membership in the classic rock group The Allman Brothers Band. Since 1997, his work with the band has earned him two Grammy nominations for best rock instrumental, in 2003 and in 2004. Over the years, Oteil has shared the stage with rock and blues legends such as Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Levon Helm, Taj Mahal, Buddy Guy, Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin, Billy Gibbons, Chuck Leavell, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Johnny Winter, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Trey Anastasio. In 2012, Oteil received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for his 17 year contribution to the Allman Brothers Band as the longest running bassist in the band\u2019s history. While touring and recording with the Allman Brothers over the years, Oteil still found time to collaborate with many other musicians. He formed his solo group, Oteil and the Peacemakers in 1998. From 1998 until 2007, the group toured extensively and released three albums. In 2001, Oteil joined Phish\u2019s keyboardist Page McConnell and The Funky Meters\u2019 drummer Russell Batiste to form Vida Blue. He also founded an improv based trio with Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann and Max Creek guitarist Scott Murawski in 2008. Oteil reunited on stage with his brother Kofi after ten years of touring separately when Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi formed the Tedeschi Trucks Band in late 2010, featuring the Burbridge brothers in the rhythm section. The 11-piece super group released their first record, Revelator, in 2011 which won a Grammy in February 2012. The Tedeschi Trucks Band played Eric Clapton\u2019s iconic Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2011. Oteil\u2019s original composition \u201cLove Has Something Else to Say\u201d was including in the DVD release and on their Grammy-winning debut album. The Tedeschi Trucks Band released their second album (and first live album) in 2012, titled \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talkin\u201d. Over the years, Oteil has also recorded and shared the stage with jazz and jazz-rock fusion legends Herbie Hancock, Roy Haynes, Randy Brecker, John Scofield, Jerry Goodman, Bob Moses, Lenny White, Steve Smith, Bela Fleck, Jimmy Herring, Howard Levi, Victor Wooten and Branford Marsalis. Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart joined forces with John Mayer in 2015 to form \u201cDead & Company\u201d with Burbridge on bass and Jeff Chimenti on keys. The band toured the US in the fall of 2015 and the summer of 2016 and 2017. These tours included sold-out shows at Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Citi Field and a headlining spot at Bonnaroo Music Festival. Plans for future Dead & Company shows are underway, including the destination event \u201cPlaying in the Sand\u201d in Riviera Maya, Mexico in February 2018. Oteil\u2019s fourth solo record, \u201cWater In The Desert\u201d will be released on October 20, 2017 and is available for pre-order here: http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/oteilburbridge.

In fact, MCA released an album in 2013 called ICON. With seven #1 songs & 25 charted singles his hits include: \u201cIt Turns Me Inside Out\u201d, \u201cRing On Her Finger Time on Her Hands\u201d, \u201dShe\u2019s Lyin\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t Mind the Thorns if You\u2019re the Rose\u201d, \u201cDixie Road\u201d, \u201cSomebody\u2019s Gonna Love You\u201d, \u201cGoing Going Gone\u201d, \u201cYou Got A Good Love Comin\u201d, \u201cFools Gold\u201d, and \u201cMornin Ride\u201d. Several crossover hits include, \u201cTouch & Go Crazy\u201d, \u201cIOU\u201d and the duet with Barbara Mandrell, \u201cTo Me\u201d. An additional duet with Suzie Boggus, \u201cHopelessly Yours\u201d, was nominated for a Grammy. The CD \u201cAmerican Patriot\u201d, recorded & released in 1992, went Platinum in 3 months. Greenwood\u2019s latest CD is: \"I Want to be in Your World\". He wrote three of the seven songs & plays saxophone on the original track, \u201cHere Comes Love There Goes My Heart\u201d. He also covered the Michael McDonald/Kenny Loggins ballad, \u201cYou Can Let Go Now.\u201d McDonald is featured playing piano on the song. Lee Greenwood has won numerous industry awards including, Male Vocalist of the year for the Academy of Country Music in 1983, two Male Vocalist of the Year awards from the Country Music Association, 1983 & 1984 and a Grammy for Top Male Vocal Performance in 1985 for \u201cI.O.U.\u201d. He also won CMA Song of the Year in 1985 for writing \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d The song, \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d has been voted the most recognizable patriotic song in America. The singer knows first-hand what it\u2019s like to have loved ones fighting for the freedom of all Americans as his father served in the Navy & the Merchant Marine in World War II. \u201cUSA\u201d is now part of the film for Homeland Security shown when swearing in new citizens to the United States. \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d went far beyond what Greenwood expected when he wrote it in the back of his tour bus in 1983. The song has been in the top five on the country singles charts three times (1991, 2001 and 2003), giving it the distinction of being the only song in any genre of music to achieve that feat. It was also #1 on the pop charts after 9/11/01. Greenwood says; \u201cUSA is the song I always felt the need to write\u201d. \u201cI wanted to have something that would unite Americans from coast to coast. and to instill pride back in the United States. The song represents my family, my community and those men & women who have paid the price for the freedoms we all love & enjoy.\u201d In 2011, Beyonce offered her version of \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d as a download, with the proceeds going to the 9/11 firefighters fund in NYC. It has been performed by contestants on the Fox Network\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d twice & was the winning song in the 2011 \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d competition on ABC. It is performed at all military and patriotic events throughout the year all across America. \u201cUSA\u201d has also been in several movies. Greenwood performs for many charitable events and gives his time & name to numerous organizations and fundraisers. He is the National spokesperson for \u201cProducts for Good\u201d, the Honor 1 Campaign, and on the advisory board of the \u201cChallenger Commission\u201d. The singer is also a member of the National Endowment for the Arts Council, a Presidential appointment. Music has always been a part of Greenwood\u2019s life. He started playing the piano when he was seven and the saxophone at 12. In junior high, he started his first group called the Moonbeams. His sister Patricia was the piano player in the band. By the time, he finished High School he played most all the instruments in the orchestra and was the Drum Major for the marching band. Greenwood was born in Los Angeles California & finished high school in Sacramento in June 1960. He passed on track & music scholarships to the College of the Pacific along with a professional baseball career to pursue his passion for music. He also elected to skip his high school graduation ceremony to begin work at the Golden Hotel & Casino in Reno Nevada with his own band, the \u201cApollos\u201d. That turned out to be a great choice. The California native was discovered in 1979 by Larry McFaden, who saw him performing in a show at the Nugget Casino in Sparks, Nevada. Larry was the bass player and bandleader for Mel Tillis. He brought the singer to Nashville and got him signed to the Halsey Agency, who booked the Oak Ridge Boys. He began working with producer Jerry Crutchfield who would record with Lee for the next 20 years. \u201cChoosing songs to record is always exciting,\u201d says Greenwood. \u201cI\u2019m a songwriter as well and I love lyrics that have depth and emotion. I\u2019m thankful for the many writers & artists who have contributed to my career\u201d. Lee and his wife, Kimberly, a former Miss Tennessee, fell in love on his 1989 USO/DOD tour. They were married in Nashville in 1992 and have two sons, Dalton and Parker. Greenwood has also released a book in 2012, \"Does God Still Bless the USA\". It features a 30 day calendar, \u201cPrayers of a Patriot\u201d and includes two songs, written by Greenwood, free for download in the back of the book. One is a new version of \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d and the other is a Praise & Worship song, \u201cShow me the Way\u201d.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "90 Church St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901", "Artist": "Shane Gillis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10232739.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.4956959, -74.44326579999999], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "Comedy, Stand Up Comedy, Stand Up", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Stress Factory Comedy Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102761056-shane-gillis-at-stress-factory-comedy-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Shane Gillis is a stand-up comic based out of New York City, recently named an \u201cUp-Next\u201d Comic at Comedy Central\u2019s 2019 Clusterfest in San Francisco and a \u201cNew Face\u201d at Just For Laughs in Montreal.

His family comes from a long line of musicians known as Ntontas (\"players of horns\") and his mother is a vocalist and choir director. He and his siblings were introduced to blues, jazz and African traditional music early in life. Mr. Sitson is a pioneer of a new generation of multi-culturally influenced African musicians who are integrating into their musical styles their own exciting yet bewildering welter of \"in-between\" living experiences (north/south, tradition/modernity, 20th/21st century). His daring musical project combines in a most innovative way jazz, gospel, blues and traditional African polyphonies, polyrhythms and melodies. By freely combining his trademark vocal acrobatics with a breathtakingly creative command of oral and body percussions and miscellaneous effects, Mr. Sitson forged an eloquent vocabulary capable of communicating far beyond any limits of language or custom. Through his vocal wizardry, he stunningly creates an endless range of sounds and atmospheres. Sitson's seamless four- octave range travels from a soulful, resonantly masculine tenor with woodwind-like overtones to a high-soaring, nearly genderless spiritual wail, a feat that recalls Brazil's Milton Nascimento, another deep-rooted yet restlessly protean, jazz-inflected shape-changer. Gino Sitson's four-octave vocal range plus his skills as a composer and arranger put him in high demand for recording sessions and for commercials and radio / television jingles (Danone, Dim, Peugeot, Vahine, etc). The versatile young vocalist performed in a musical and co-composed part of the music (Jeanne et le Gar\u00c3\u00a7on Formidable). He has laid down tracks or shared the stage with Manu Dibango, Ron Carter, Papa Wemba, Wally Badarou, John Scofield, Geri Allen, David Gilmore, Haruko Nara, Bobby McFerrin, Frank Wess, Ray Lema, Craig Harris, James Hurt, Antoine Roney, John William, Mario Canonge, Wallace Roney, Brice Wassy, Oliver NGoma, Exile One, Steve Potts, So Why? (Featuring Youssou NDour, Papa Wemba, Wally Badarou, Jabu Khanyile & Bayete, Lourdes Van-Dunem, and Lucky Dube) and La Compagnie Creole, among others. In 2008, Mr. Sitson was invited by Bobby McFerrin to join him on a PBS documentary (\"The music instinct: Science & Song\"), to take part in a special project that took place at the Carnegie Hall (\"Instant Opera\"). A member of Chamber Music America, he is regularly engaged for movie scores and commercials. He has appeared several times on TV and also composed music for the noted children's TV show, Dora The Explorer (Nickelodeon). Since 2006, Mr. Sitson is a Cultural Arts ambassador for the city of Miami (Florida). Meanwhile, his international career continues apace. He has received the \"Parents Choice Silver Medal Honor Award\" in 2004 and was nominated for the RFI Awards 2000. His recent output includes soundtracks to Betrayal (Kevin Ngooh) and Blue Lotus (Dayo Ayodele); jingles for France Television and France 3, and an ongoing collaboration with his German-based brother, vocalist-composer-percussionist-actor Njamy Sitson. Mr. Sitson performed at the Carnegie Hall with his own group in 2008.

Surprisingly, virtually all of the youths return. But sometimes they don't. Four out of the original six of the members of The Amish Outlaws were born and raised in Lancaster, PA and had a strict Amish upbringing. No electricity from land lines, no alcohol, no musical instruments, but their spirits were too wild for the Amish lifestyle. Once they trampled in the Devil's Playground, there was no turning back. In the years since Rumspringa, the members of the Amish Outlaws have become very well acclimated to the pleasures and vices of the modern world... music, most of all. It was this mutual love of music that brought the Outlaws together in a chance meeting at the 2002 Pocono Vacation Park \"Rock and Roll Hootenanny.\" While their appearance drew snickers and stares from most of the crowd, they sat down together and the Brothers were soon like brothers, sharing not only the bond of having left the Amish life behind, but also the deep mutual love of music. Together they delved deeply into the 16 years of American culture they missed, watching endless hours of classic MTV, listening to the radio, CDs, records, tapes... anything they could get their hands on. But just listening and watching was not enough...  the Brothers soon decided to form a band that combined their love of the modern world and their traditional upbringing. They met some non-Amish friends out in the world (\"English\" as we call the non-Amish), making them \"honorary Amish\" when they joined the band. Thus, with a bold lust for life and a fire for music and performance that can only come from 16 years of repression, The Amish Outlaws were unleashed upon the world. There is no \"typical\" Amish Outlaws show, but the average crowd can expect to see men in full Amish garb releasing all of their pent up energy with an infectious joy. With a set that is always evolving as the Brothers discover more and more music and culture, The Amish Outlaws constantly surprise the audience and keep them guessing as to what they could possibly play next, from Johnny Cash to Jay Z, Lady Gaga to Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, Bon Jovi to Elvis Presley, The Foo Fighters to Dropkick Murphys, to theme songs from the TV shows they have come to know. Throughout, The Outlaws spin yarns about the Brothers' upbringing and adventures since Rumpsringa. Amish Outlaw gigs are less performances than they are initiations into the life of an Amish Outlaw and parties celebrating the Brothers' newfound freedom.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "479 Bay Ave, Ocean Beach, NY 11770", "Artist": "audio riot ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11342067.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.648968, -73.1567419], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "Classic Rock, Dance, Pop, Rock, Punk, Country And More, Country, Electronic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Sandbar Fire Island", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102507286-audio-riot-at-sandbar-fire-island?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Bookings by 107 Productions Productions", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Egalitarian ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11630302.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7127753, -74.0059728], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "eGALitarian Brass Band", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102812708-egalitarian-at-west-village-nyc?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "classical brass quintet by day, brass band w drums by night", "otherInfo": "Come on out to hear some New Orleans favorites, pop arrangements and more."}, {"Address": "650 Lee Blvd, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598", "Artist": "Raquel & the Wildflowers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11624065.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.3286166, -73.8077192], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "Country, Rock, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "PB PIZZA & BEER CONCERT SERIES", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102796779-raquel-and-the-wildflowers-at-pb-pizza-and-beer?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "66 Rivington St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Strange Majik ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11460805.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.720735, -73.98991269999999], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Marshall Stack", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102774633-strange-majik-at-marshall-stack?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Raised on rock 'n' roll born on the blues.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2 6th Ave, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Jeb Patton ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11432341.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7194085, -74.0049093], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Elijah Balbed Quartet", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102772364-jeb-patton-at-the-django?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Described as both a \"young phenom\u2026on piano\" and an \"absolute great,\" Jeb Patton has earned a well-regarded reputation in the international jazz community.

Formed in Leeds in 2015, KOYO have fast become a major factor in the city\u2019s burgeoning music scene. Tagged with the prog rock label, they are in fact proficient, reflective and utterly self-effacing, a far cry from the cape-wearing and wizard-hatted indulgence of your traditional progressive musicians. True, some of their songs are longer and they are well schooled in music \u2013 literally. But KOYO wear their versatility and charm very lightly indeed. Formed by Huw Edwards and Jacob Price, KOYO are an accomplished five-piece. Blending influences as wide as Ozric Tentacles and The Velvet Underground, My Bloody Valentine and Kurt Vile, they give the impression of being able to play just about anything. KOYO combine beautiful melancholy vocals with intricate riffs and the poetry of Nick Drake. Sampling and synthesisers provide astral soundscapes, grounded by a gifted rhythm section. They are at once delicate and robust. A powerful live force, KOYO create sonic spectacles through soaring layers of sound. They fill and transform space, create darkness and colour. Songs become extended improvisations, spontaneous expressions of emotion. KOYO are an unmatchable dynamic talent. Debut single Tetrachromat, Pts. 1 & 2 hypnotises and seduces, transports you to another level of consciousness. KOYO lure you heart first with their fearless emotional honesty. Their self-titled album \u2018KOYO\u2019 is available now through 88 Watt Records, ranked 24th in Classic Rock Magazine's best albums of 2017. New Single Jettisoned is due out in April, followed by the hotly anticipated Live At Rak Studios session. KOYO follow that with international tour dates and summer festival appearances.

And this is why Vasi Vallis brought \u2018Reaper\u2019 to life in 2005, a music project which was not supposed to follow the path of the softer sounds of \u2018NamNamBulu\u2019 and \u2018Frozen Plasma\u2019. Basic idea was, that this project should be fun and not take things too seriously. While hard beats meet with catchy and earworm-like melodies and combine to a danceable mix, which makes the listener hum long parts of the song, the band's lyrics deal with all the clich\u00e9s that can be subsumed under the superordinate \u2018evil\u2019. The band plays quite obviously with topics such as death, Satan, sex and women, not without a healthy portion of sarcasm. Perfectly fitting to all those clich\u00e9s, \u2018Reapers\u2019 first EP was named \u2018Angst\u2019. With their following debut album \u2018Hell starts with an H\u2019, Vasi Vallis was joined by Gregor Beyerle to support \u2018Combichrist\u2019 on their tour across Europe that made a lot of people fall in love with their music. Songs like \u2018Robuste Maschine\u2019 or \u2018X-Junkie\u2019 still fill the dance floors of scene clubs around the world. By the end of 2007 the EP \u2018The Devil is Female\u2019 was released and made it directly to #1 of the DAC (German Alternative Charts). What followed was a tour in conspicuous outfits as well as additional musical support on guitars and drums. All that made \u2018Reaper\u2019 play the bigger scene festivals around the world. After taking a creative break, the band is coming back with a new album in 2016 \u2013 of course once again with melodies from hell, pure evil and a huge portion of subliminal humour.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "620 Van Houten Ave, Clifton, NJ 07013", "Artist": "Eyes of the Living ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.8579247, -74.14755339999999], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Dingbatz", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022514187-eyes-of-the-living-at-dingbatz?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "85 Ave A, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Ari Hoenig ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8224716.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.72525, -73.9844492], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "duo with Edmar Casteneda Drom NYC", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102806391-ari-hoenig-at-drom?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Ari Hoenig (born on November 13, 1973 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), is a New York based jazz drummer, composer and educator known for his unusual and intense approach to drumming emphasizing complex rhythms in direct harmony with other group members.

My parents told me growing up that I had a great voice, but being a kid, I basically thought they were stupid and never pursued it. When I was 16 years old, my first real girlfriend (definition of real girlfriend= first sex) told me that I had a great voice\u2026for some reason I believed her and became a professional traveling musician, as in I sang while driving my car. After years of playing my original music, opening for the likes of Warrant, Bret Michaels, White Lion, Foreigner, Ratt, Dokken, Meatloaf, Rick Springfield and many other 80\u2019s icons, I met Dan Halen while on tour and I said \u201cfuck this\u201d and we started Mullett so we could have the cool dressing room and get free shit backstage and the rest is history! I love the fans and love to ROCK\u2026.PEACE! Dan Halen \u2013 Guitar/Keyboards From a very young age I knew that I wanted to be on stage rocking big stadiums and ripping on my guitar. Eddie Van Halen inspired me to play guitar and Ace Frehley showed me how to entertain the crowd. Sometimes people say I am too serious\u2026.yea fuck them! Unless they mean \u201cyo\u2026that dude\u2019s a serious kick ass guitar player\u201d or \u201cwow Dan is seriously very good looking\u201d then I guess that\u2019s pretty cool. Ok\u2026maybe I am a little serious but that\u2019s only because someone has to have their shit together touring with Ron, Teddy and Jef\u2026.I am practically their sponsor and therapist, not to mention if it wasn\u2019t for me we would never make it to the next gig. I love to rock the crowd, that\u2019s my passion! ROCK ON! Jef Leppard \u2013 Drums When I was young I learned that if I made a lot of noise and never stopped moving that people would not be able to stop staring at me. I loved the attention, so I made a lot of noise and I have never stopped! When I was eight years old in Miami, FL I made my first drum kit by using the dining room table chairs as drums and the china as cymbals. When I was twelve years old I started babysitting all the kids in the neighborhood so I could save money for my first drum kit. The babysitting gig did not last long, cause all the kids I was watching starting busting shit in their house and swearing all the time (fuckers)! So after touring with a bunch of national acts I met Ron Jovi in Vegas and was asked to join Mullett! I love these guys and now I am the most crazy and loudest m\u2019fer in the band and that\u2019s the way I like it! Fuck yea people\u2026BIG LOVE JEF LEPPARD STYLE!!!!! Teddy Lee \u2013 Bass I grew up in a small country town in Connecticut and like to keep things slow and simple like my women! After touring for several years, I met Jef Leppard, Ron Jovi and Dan Halen in a club in Vegas in 2009, and instantly hit it off. They asked me to play bass for Mullett, and I have been rocking with these guys ever since. I love to get on my knees and play to the girls in the front row and I am all about the 3 B\u2019s, booze, bimbos and bass.

In 1977 he was a founding member of the Yellowjackets, which he stayed with until 1983, simultaneously having a solo career and working as a session guitarist. In 1986, Ford toured with Miles Davis and he had two separate periods (1985 and 1987) with Sadao Watanabe, but he seemed to really find himself in 1992 when he returned to his roots: the blues. Ford formed a new group, the Blue Line, and subsequently recorded a couple of blues-rock dates for Stretch that are among the finest of his career. In 1999, he released Sunrise on Rhino and Supernatural on Blue Thumb. Ford signed to the Concord Jazz label in 2002 and released Blue Moon that same year, followed by Keep on Running in 2003 and Truth in 2007.

Blake's gift for composition and band leading, so ably demonstrated on his 2012 recording debut The Eleventh Hour, reflects years of live and studio experience across the aesthetic spectrum. Through years-long memberships in the Tom Harrell Quintet, the Kenny Barron Trio and other top ensembles, Blake has reaped the benefits of prolonged exposure to the greats of our time \u2014 arguably of all time. Through his powerful, evocative drumming and fully rounded artistry, he's also left a huge imprint on the music of such rising figures in jazz as Hans Glawischnig, Alex Sipiagin, Donny McCaslin, Avishai Cohen, Omer Avital, Patrick Cornelius, Michael Janisch, Shauli Einav, Jaleel Shaw and more. To date, Blake has appeared on over 50 albums. Born in Philadelphia in 1976, Johnathan Blake is the son of renowned jazz violinist John Blake, Jr. \u2014 himself a stylistic chameleon and an important ongoing influence. After beginning on drums at age 10, Johnathan gained his first performing experience with the Lovett Hines Youth Ensemble, led by the renowned Philly jazz educator. It was during this period, at Hines's urging, that Blake began to compose his own music. Later he worked with saxophonist Robert Landham in a youth jazz ensemble at Settlement Music School. Blake graduated from George Washington High School and went on to attend the highly respected jazz program at William Paterson University, where he studied with Rufus Reid, John Riley, Steve Wilson and Horace Arnold. At this time Blake also began working professionally with the Oliver Lake Big Band, Roy Hargrove and David Sanchez. In 2006 he was recognized with an ASCAP Young Jazz Composers Award, and in 2007 he earned his Masters from Rutgers University, focusing on composition. He studied with the likes of Ralph Bowen, Conrad Herwig and Stanley Cowell. Deeply aware of Philadelphia's role as a historical nerve center of American music, Blake has immersed himself in the city's storied legacy \u2014 not just jazz but also soul, R&B and hip-hop. In many ways he's an heir to Philadelphia drum masters such as Philly Joe Jones, Bobby Durham, Mickey Roker and Edgar Bateman, not to mention younger mentors including Byron Landham, Leon Jordan and Ralph Peterson, Jr. Today Blake is himself an exponent of the Philadelphia sound, described by Aidan Levy of JazzTimes in a review of The Eleventh Hour as: the vertiginous sensation of being both slightly behind the beat and hurtling into the next measure. Approaches like this, one might add, can only be learned by sitting at Mickey Roker's right hand and absorbing exactly how the ride cymbal is struck. Such is the painstaking firsthand exploration that undergirds and informs Blake's musicianship. Blake's playing helped the Mingus Big Band land Grammy nominations for the albums Tonight at Noon (2002) and I Am Three (2005). It has also earned Blake spots in groups led by Russell Malone, Randy Brecker, Joe Locke, Ronnie Cuber and other seasoned jazz veterans. As trumpet great Brian Lynch has said: Johnathan Blake is without peer among young drummers for the clarity of his beat and the incisiveness of his swing. His forward-thinking vision as a leader, moreover, and ability to harness the varied talents of his band mates, makes The Eleventh Hour one of the strongest debuts in recent memory, and surely the first of many fine efforts to follow.", "otherInfo": "Edmar Castaneda & Ari Hoenig Duo\n\nJohnathan Blake Trio feat.

After spending several years working comedy clubs across the country, Breuer settled in as a regular on the New York comedy club circuit. After being in New York for only seven months, Breuer landed a gig on the nationally syndicated show, \u201cUptown Comedy Club,\u201d where he spent two seasons. Later he appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cHome Improvement\u201d starring funny man Tim Allen, before making his big break which came in 1995 when he joined the cast of NBC\u2019s legendary \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d During his four years on SNL, Breuer quickly became a fan-favorite for his original character \u201cGoat Boy\u201d and his dead-on impressions of actor Joe Pesci.

The footage that was captured blended together to create \u201cThe Jim Breuer Road Journals,\" which showcased what life is like on the road with a comedian and his father. Videos from that tour also sparked the making of his documentary \u201cMore Than Me,\u201d which was shown at the 2009 Montreal Film Festival. In July of 2009, Breuer\u2019s one-hour Comedy Central special \u201cLet's Clear the Air\u201d premiered with hilarious topics that included what \"success\" really is, his SNL days and life with his elderly parents, his wife and his three daughters.

Here\u2019s the story of David Bromberg, or at least some of it . . . Born in Philadelphia in 1945 and raised in Tarrytown, NY, \u201cas a kid I listened to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and whatever else was on the radio,\u201d says Bromberg. \u201cI discovered Pete Seeger and The Weavers and, through them, Reverend Gary Davis. I then discovered Big Bill Broonzy, who led me to Muddy Waters and the Chicago blues. This was more or less the same time I discovered Flatt and Scruggs, which led to Bill Monroe and Doc Watson.\u201d Bromberg began studying guitar-playing when he was 13 and eventually enrolled in Columbia University as a musicology major. The call of the Greenwich Village folk scene in the mid-\u201960s drew David to the downtown clubs and coffeehouses, where he could watch and learn from the best performers, including primary sources such as his inspiration and teacher, the Reverend Gary Davis. Bromberg\u2019s sensitive and versatile approach to guitar-playing earned him jobs playing the Village \u201cbasket houses\u201d for tips, the occasional paying gig, and lots of employment as a backing musician for Tom Paxton, Jerry Jeff Walker and Rosalie Sorrels, among others. He became a first-call, \u201chired gun\u201d guitarist for recording sessions, ultimately playing on hundreds of records by artists including Bob Dylan (New Morning, Self Portrait, Dylan), Link Wray, The Eagles, Ringo Starr, Willie Nelson, and Carly Simon. An unexpected and wildly successful solo spot at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival in Great Britain led to a solo deal with Columbia Records, for whom David recorded four albums. His eponymous 1971 debut not only included the mock-anguished \u201cSuffer to Sing the Blues,\u201d a Bromberg original that became an FM radio staple, but also \u201cThe Holdup,\u201d a songwriting collaboration with former Beatle George Harrison, whom he met at his manager\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner festivities. Harrison also played slide guitar on the track. Through Bromberg\u2019s manager, Al Aronowitz, David also met the Grateful Dead and wound up with four of their members, including Jerry Garcia, playing on his next two albums. Bromberg\u2019s range of material, based in the folk and blues idioms, continually expanded with each new album to encompass bluegrass, ragtime, country and ethnic music, and his touring band grew apace. By the mid-\u201970s, the David Bromberg Big Band included horn-players, a violinist, and several multi-instrumentalists, including David himself. Among the best-known Bromberg Band graduates: mandolinist Andy Statman, later a major figure in the Klezmer music movement in America, and fiddler Jay Ungar (who wrote the memorable \u201cAshokan Farewell\u201d for Ken Burns\u2019 PBS documentary, \u201cThe Civil War\u201d). Despite jubilant, loose-limbed concerts and a string of acclaimed albums on the Fantasy label, Bromberg found himself exhausted by the logistics of the music business. \u201cI decided to change the direction of my life,\u201d he explains. So David dissolved his band in 1980, and he and his artist/musician wife, Nancy Josephson, moved from Northern California to Chicago, where David attended the Kenneth Warren School of Violin Making. Though he still toured periodically, the recordings slowed to a trickle and then stopped. After \u201ctoo many Chicago winters,\u201d in 2002 David and Nancy were lured to Wilmington, Del., where they became part of the city\u2019s artist-in-residence program and where David could establish David Bromberg Fine Violins, a retail store and repair shop for high quality instruments. Frequent participation in the city\u2019s weekly jam sessions helped rekindle Bromberg\u2019s desire to make music again, as did the encouragement of fellow musicians Chris Hillman (The Byrds, Desert Rose Band, Flying Burrito Brothers) and bluegrass wizard Herb Pedersen, and David\u2019s manager, Steve Bailey. The jams also led to the formation of Angel Band, fronted by Nancy and two other female vocalists, with David serving as an accompanist. With the release of Try Me One More Time, David continues his musical revitalization, playing shows on his own, backed by (and supporting) Angel Band, his own David Bromberg Quartet, and reunions of the David Bromberg Big Band, the configuration depending on the circumstance.

If not for an intervention - stumbling upon the catalog of Weird Al Yankovic at 11 years old - he would have followed in his father\u2019s path or perhaps become a jazz purist. But Weird Al changed everything. Jake started a parody band and sang his newly-written lyrics to classics like \u201cAll Star\u201d by Smashmouth and \u201cMen in Black\u201d by Will Smith, along with composing new family classics such as \u201cAmy, You\u2019re Turning 49\u201d and \u201cCharles, Charles Sherman.\u201d Fast forward some years beyond his time studying at Berklee College of Music and it\u2019s clear Jake has found a way to combine his appreciation of great songwriting with his piano/organ-playing prowess. He has become a go-to musician on recordings, and tours for artists including Meshell Ndegeocello, Bilal, Andrew Bird and Nick Hakim. Chance the Rapper\u2019s Grammy-winning song \u201cNo Problem\u201d includes some of Jake\u2019s work. More recently, Jake has re-tapped his well of musicality and songmaking to create his upcoming album, Jake Sherman Gets Sexy. Due out in March 2020, the album is a journey through modern dating and relationships, with a point of view that is somehow both poignant and Weird Al-esque.

Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories. His most famous albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life. He has gradually become identified with progressive politics. He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including eighteen Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, and continues to have a strong global fan base.

The ensemble consists of four clarinets, three trumpets, a tambora, a tarola, a tuba (Sousaphone style), three trombones, and three singers. Banda el Recodo was founded by Don Cruz Liz\u00e1rraga from Sinaloa, Mexico. Although he had to drop out of high school to work, Liz\u00e1rraga was an excellent bandleader and musician. Self-taught on the clarinet, he was forced to sell one of his hogs to pay for his new musical instrument. Once he moved to Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, Lizarraga signed a deal with RCA Victor and soon formed Banda el Recodo. Since his death in 1995, Lizarraga's son has taken over the group and undertaken extensive international tours.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019. Having later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone. After being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards. The love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK. Music aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat. Following on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island. The duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair.

Magos Herrera is an artist who knows what she wants her music to sound like. And it sounds great. Popmatters \u201cMagos manages to create a new style of Latin scat.

We are SquareWon. Thanks for checking out our site! Based out of NYC, and playing in every borough and festival that will have us, we are a new funk-rock band with a bluesy twist. Engendered by the emotive force of Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan, the gospel of Ray Charles, the billowing horns of Tower of Power, and the tight, driving grooves of Stevie Wonder, we aim to blow the roof off of wherever we play. Though the band itself is only five months old, our collective 130 years of musical experience lends to our incredibly tight sound. Plus we like each other so you know, that helps. Our founding members include Alex Marchica on lead vocals and keyboards, Phil Peters on drums, Jon Lijoi on trumpet, Brad Mulholland on baritone and tenor saxophone, Dillon Garrett on trombone, and Colin Dooman on bass. Marchica is our band manager and does the song writing and arranging for us while Lijoi heads our horn section (writing and co-writing horn lines), and Peters coordinates our rhythm section. Peters, Mulholland, and Garrett also assist in co-arranging/writing songs/horn lines. Clearly its a very collaborative process. How we envision our band to be for both ourselves and our audience is cathartic. We want to make you dance and feel relieved from start to finish. If you do not feel something by the time the set is over, your money back guaranteed. Gearing up to record our first E.P. at Architekt Studios with two time Grammy nominated chief engineer Mike Ferretti, we are slating its release for this summer. As preparation for our studio sessions, we are amidst playing all over the greater New York City area so keep an ear out for our us blowing a roof off sometime soon near you.", "otherInfo": "SquareWon"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Lethal Trip ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7096703, -73.9232787], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Elsewhere - Zone One", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022502180-lethal-trip-at-elsewhere-zone-one?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Rachel Feinstein ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617808.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Upstairs)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022667959-rachel-feinstein-at-the-stand-(upstairs)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Adrienne Iapalucci, Rachel Feinstein, Ian Lara, & More!"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Nore Davis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2293401.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-20", "EventDate": "Aug. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Upstairs)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022668191-nore-davis-at-the-stand-(upstairs)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "First CD \"Home Game\" on Rooftop released.

Holding residencies at Lavo and Marquee in New York and Las Vegas, Miami\u2019s LIV & Story, Omnia San Diego and more, there is an amazing buzz for Zurich\u2019s notable artist. From the sold out shows and billboards lining the streets of Europe to infinite releases on some of the globe\u2019s leading dance labels, we\u2019ve got the goods on Gil. Enlisting his roots in the open format world, Gil had a light bulb moment with house music that lit up his profile. At the top of his game, his resonation with pioneering talent like EDX, Oliver Heldens, Nora En Pure was obvious and he met his match! Serious with his craft, Gil is a legitimately trained musician (no he doesn\u2019t just press buttons) having studied a spectrum of music theory, business and production at the New York University- Clive Davis School of Recorded Music, giving him a well-endowed lead in the industry. Signing music across Sirup Music, Enormous Chills, No Definition and more, Gil\u2019s drive for dance-floor ready monsters is evident. Gaining global support from Tiesto, Don Diablo, Sam Feldt and a plethora of other boss icons in electronic music, there is no lying about the 300k+ Spotify streams and Beatport top 100 records, lining five up under his belt including \u2018Can\u2019t Let You Go\u2019 via Dirty Soul, where Bakermat and MK also hold high regard. At the clubs, on the stage, the dance floors, the pool parties and more, Gil isn\u2019t shy of a an enviable show. From sold out headlining shows to residencies across the US, it has lead him to global tours around the world including Australia, Europe, Asia and main slots at Exit Festival Serbia for 60,000+ people. On the back of this, the World Club Dome Festival in Frankfurt lit up while the hottest summer parties in Ibiza and the Greek Islands (Mykonos) alongside David Guetta and Tiesto and he even had the opportunity to play back to back with Martin Garrix, Calvin Harris, Marshmello and Kygo have been standouts. Holding high regard in electronic music and a resume of milestones, the only other thing you need to know right now is Gil Glaze has two upcoming tracks set to be his best work yet and a blazing summer ahead, so stay tuned.
