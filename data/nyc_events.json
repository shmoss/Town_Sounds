His parents were huge music fans and shared their love of blues, jazz and popular music with Chris. His African American father and Greek mother both loved music and had a huge record collection. His father first took Chris to see B.B. King when Chris was three, and, says Cain, \u201cwe never missed another show.\u201d Thanks to his parents\u2019 musical passion, young Chris saw almost every blues, jazz and rock artist that came through town, many of them repeatedly -- James Brown, Albert King, Johnny Winter, Jimi Hendrix, even The Beatles. He picked up his first guitar at age eight and learned lick after lick, song after song. He listened to his father\u2019s records over and over until the music had seeped into his soul. Cain formed his first band in 1986, and released his first album in 1987, Late Night City Blues, on the locally-based Blue Rock\u2019It label. Almost immediately, booking agents came calling. Incredibly, he was touring Europe even before he started barnstorming the U.S. The album received four W.C Handy Award nominations (now the Blues Music Awards) and the offers to perform kept rolling in. He even opened for his heroes Albert King and Albert Collins, who both asked Chris to jam on stage. The more Cain toured and recorded, the greater his reputation grew. His releases include four albums on Blue Rock\u2019It and three on Blind Pig Records, and his live performances number in the thousands. Cain has toured all over North America and made repeated trips around the world. He\u2019s performed at the Chicago Blues Festival, The Doheny Blues Festival, The Philadelphia Blues Festival, The Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, and many others. He\u2019s played concerts and festivals in Argentina, Uruguay, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Brazil, Belarus, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "4201 Central Pkwy, Dublin, CA 94568", "Artist": "Neon Velvet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6128653.jpeg", "Coordinates": [37.710239, -121.87542987085226], "Date": "2021-07-08", "EventDate": "Jul. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre availableYour Red Carpet Dance Party,", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Summer Concert Series", "moreBioInfo": "Smoochy The very best new and classic dance hits.
