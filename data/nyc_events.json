Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

In 2018 the duo found their musical counterpart in bass player Bill Crook and partnered with Pale Chord Music to continue to create and release music in single and EP formats. Spiritbox have quickly become hotly tipped as one of the most exciting, creative and unique new forces to erupt from the world of heavy music. Pushing boundaries both sonically and visually with their beautifully haunting music videos that perfectly mach the complex, heavy instrumentation combined with the juxtaposition of the ethereal, velvet textures of Courtney's singing voice and the visceral, rageful power of her screams. Drawing their name from a device that some believe is capable of communing with the dead, the band have a paranormal undertone that runs through everything they do, using EVP (electronic voice phenomena) recordings both at their live shows and within their tracks. A quick look at music videos for fan favorites such as Belcarra, Blessed Be and Rule of Nines and it's clear to see that the band are no strangers to the macabre or paranormal. Having toured the world many times over with their previous bands - metal outfit iwrestledabearonce (Courtney and Mike) and pop punk band Living With Lions (Bill) - Spiritbox absorbed the highs and lows of living as working musicians and decided to try a different and more sustainable approach when it came to releasing their music. They took the concept of supply and demand and applied it to their release model, focusing on making fans across the globe by using the social media tools available to them, releasing shorter bodies of music and removing touring from the plan until a demand was built. In doing so they quickly garnered a cult-like online following which has lead to over 10,000,000 streams across all platforms and sell outs on every physical release and most merch items they've released to date. In Feb of 2020 Spiritbox jumped on a plane and finally went on tour in support of After The Burial across Europe, which was unfortunately cut short due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Despite having to return to Canada early, Spiritbox have remained busy - releasing their latest single Holy Roller which debuted number 25 on the Billboard Hot Hard Rock Songs chart and debuted on Sirius XM Liquid Metal at number 9, climbing to number 1 for 7 consecutive weeks on the Devils Dozen countdown.

He's a singer of clear tenor with an emotional range befitting that of his namesake Bob Dylan. During his college years he maintained an esprit de corps with fellow pop song enthusiasts. In his twenties he whittled it down to a foursome fierce with alt-rock sensibilities named M.Headphone with whom he stormed the San Francisco music scene from 1998-2003. A solo artist since 2004, Connor is set to release his 5th full-length in the first half of '21. In contemporary quarantine fashion, the new record is a Kickstarter-funded effort that sees the artist playing virtually all instruments. With producer Coley O'Toole of the platinum-selling band We The Kings behind the boards for this new batch of songs, Connor expands his sonic soundscape while sharpening his thematic focus. The tentatively titled \"Infinity Days\" will be available on all major digital platforms. Son. Husband. Father. Teacher. Humanitarian. As a lyricist, Dylan Connor's subject material draws from such titles. Rooted in the craft of classic singer/songwriters and inspired by cultures of the world, Connor continues in the tradition of Billy Bragg, Ben Folds, and Tom Petty. Present-day comparisons include Dawes, Nada Surf, and Phoebe Bridgers, while Connor himself claims kindred spirit influences including Jeff Buckley, Matthew Sweet's power pop, and Death Cab For Cutie. 2004's \"Plug In\" marked the first of four collaborations with acclaimed producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads) and saw Dylan Connor recognized by American Songwriter Magazine with a nod for Best Lyrics. Ten years and several album/touring cycles later, Connor released 2014's \"Blood Like Fire (Songs For Syria)\" \u2013 a charity project highlighting the war in Syria with 100% of proceeds allocated to the education of Syrian refugees via the Karam Foundation. Connor then contributed his song \"Man of Peace\" to the 2016 feature film documentary \"Little Gandhi\" by writer/director Sam Kadi that became Syria's first official submission for \"Best Foreign Language Film\" during the 90th Academy Awards. Connor also serves as Chair of Missions for the Syrian-American Council and has embarked upon humanitarian expeditions to the Syrian border to deliver aid and help raise awareness in solidarity with all those affected by the nearly decade-long war. Connor first came to love the country and its people after having married a Syrian immigrant and making several visits to her homeland. The spiritual union with his Syrian partner led to the cognizant evolution of his art. Once the revolution began, Connor knew he would not remain silent. \"If Only You'd Listen\" (2019) \u2013 a single co-written and produced by Coley O'Toole \u2013 features Connor's empathetic voice amidst an ornate, Beatles-esque arrangement. A song of stately immediacy imploring adult listeners to take action on behalf of children amidst today's combined crises of climate change, gun violence and war, \"If Only You'd Listen\" has over 8 million streams online. February 2021 sees Dylan Connor contributing his current single \"Bring You Back\" to the theatrical and VOD release of \"Adverse,\" a new crime thriller starring Sean Astin and Mickey Rourke. \"Bring You Back\" was commissioned by writer/director Brian Metcalf after being impressed by Connor's talent, sincerity and knack for melody. Produced by Brooklyn-based musician Mark Mollica, \"Bring You Back\" strikes an elegiac tone while demonstrating Connor's ability to collaborate on another's creative vision. Anchored along the Connecticut shoreline where he lives with his wife and two children, Dylan Connor teaches Latin to high schoolers in between concert performances at venues like NYC\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, L.A.\u2018s The Mint, and CT\u2019s Fairfield Theatre Company.", "otherInfo": "Every Friday (almost) I will be playing a solo show at Las Vetas Lounge as I get warmed up for the release of my new record Infinity Days and for a fall 2021 tour."}, {"Address": "4210 Palisades Cte Dr A - 401, West Nyack, NY 10994", "Artist": "Dusty Slay Comedy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10428400.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.0981032, -73.95797979999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Standup Comedy, Spoken Comedy, Comedy", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "West Nyack Levity Live Comedy Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102759166-dusty-slay-comedy-at-west-nyack-levity-live-comedy-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Dusty Slay is a stand up comedian based in Nashville, TN.

Formed in the mid 1990s, the band soon became a highly acclaimed musical force on the East Coast underground Jazz and Jam Band scene. This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

Kaleta. The singer, guitarist and percussionist from the West African country of Benin Republic lived his adolescent life in Lagos, Nigeria where Afrobeat was born. Kaleta performed and toured the world with the gods, Fela Kuti and King Sunny Ade, along with Majek Fashek and recently Lauryn Hill. Now based in New York City, Kaleta was overjoyed to find Super Yamba Band and hear their take on the vintage, psychedelic sounds of his native country. Super Yamba takes its cues from artists like Orchestre Poly-Rythmo, El Rego and The Funkees all legends in their own right for pioneering the classic styles of Afro-Funk and Afro-Rock in Benin and Nigeria. Super Yamba Band have dialed in the nuances of some of the rarest grooves out there with a timeless sound that will move everyone in the room to dance! Kaleta got his start in the late 70s performing in church and was soon after picked up by iconic Juju master and world music pioneer King Sunny Ade. A few years later Fela Kuti came calling. Kaleta would go on to tour the world playing guitar for the King of Afrobeat in his band Egypt 80 through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Audiences will hear Kaleta sing in several different languages native to West Africa including Fon, Goun, Yoruba and Ewe, along with French and Pidgin English, \"the official language of Afrobeat\" he says with a grin. Super Yamba Band's live performances with Kaleta are absolutely explosive. Afropop Worldwide said \"their ace-up-the-sleeve: the singer Kaleta, whose James Brown grunts have got to be some of the best in the business.\" With Kaleta at the helm Super Yamba Band have recently erupted onto stages at Paste Magazine's Emerging Music Festival, World Music Institute's Masters Of African Music Series, The Untitled Action Bronson Show (Viceland TV), Secret Planet APAP 2018 Showcase and more, giving audiences an unforgettable experience of world-class Afro-Funk dance music.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Girdle Ridge Rd, Katonah, NY 10536", "Artist": "Sean Watkins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7248204.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.2380636, -73.6454997], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Singer, Songwriter, Folk, Country, Bluegrass", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Venetian Theater at Caramoor", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102634643-sean-watkins-at-venetian-theater-at-caramoor?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "According to Wikipedia: Sean Watkins (born February 18, 1977) is a guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter, and is one third of the contemporary folk band Nickel Creek. His sister Sara Watkins, also a member of Nickel Creek, plays violin and sings background vocals on the second of his two solo albums. As a whole, Nickel Creek recently participated in a project dubbed Mutual Admiration Society, a collaboration with former Toad The Wet Sprocket singer Glen Phillips. As a solo musician, Sean Watkins early material was contemporary bluegrass, but as time goes on, he has incorporated various other influences into his music (especially indie rock). Sean Watkins's solo music career seems to be going the same path as Nickel Creek; turning from beautiful traditional bluegrass songs to indie rock with bluegrass instrumentation. Sean Watkins is the oldest member of Nickel Creek. \"My first instrument was the piano when I was six\", Sean recalls. \"I took classic instruction for seven years, but three years into that I discovered bluegrass music, through my piano teacher's son, who had a bluegrass band that played every Saturday night at a pizza place in Carlsbad. I really got into it, and when Sara [Watkins] and I met Chris, we started playing with him on Saturday nights too.\"[1] He began playing mandolin in the early career with Nickel Creek, but later switched to guitar. Sean made it to the National Flatpicking Championship in 1993 at age 16. Now Nickel Creek has exploded in the contemporary folk/bluegrass scene. This Watkins has already released 3 solo albums and appeared on many others. Of this experience, Watkins has said, \"I've learned now to look back to music that has lasted through the years and to appreciate the timeless value that it has.\" Sean's first album Let it Fall consists primarily of bluegrass inspired instrumental tracks. Providing the vocals on the only sung track on the album is former Toad the Wet Sprocket frontman Glen Phillips. Sean's second album, 26 Miles was a much bigger departure from bluegrass. While still mainly acoustic, the album showed influences from jazz, indie rock, and new age music. His third album, Blinder's On continues along many of the same lines as the previous one. It was recently announced on Nickel Creek's website that the band would go on hiatus at the end of 2007. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Sean states that he plans to make music for movies.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Vagabon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9162680.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7193649, -73.9387843], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022603319-vagabon-at-brooklyn-steel?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "\"Break the rules you think you are bound by.\" That's the recurring sentiment L\u00e6titia Tamko carried with her through the writing and recording of her second album under the Vagabon moniker. Her first, 2017's Infinite Worlds, was an indie breakthrough that put her on the map, prompting Tamko to tour around the world and quit her job in electrical/computer engineering to pursue a career in music full-time. Tamko's Nonesuch Records debut All The Women In Me, finds her in a state of creative expansion, leaning fully into some of the experimental instincts she flirted with on the previous album. This time around, she's throwing genre to the wind. All The Women In Me is a vibrant culmination of influences, emotional landscapes, and moods; a colorful and masterful statement by an artist and producer stepping into her own. \"I was in a pretty tortured headspace when I returned home from touring Infinite Worlds. That album contained some of the first songs I'd ever written, and more people than I could have ever imagined heard it,\" Tamko says. \"I was proud to become a full-time musician and recognized how rare of a thing that is, but was also debilitated by the very same fact. Fear overtook me and I couldn't write. I felt stagnant and unsure of what to do next.\" That anxiety eventually thawed and gave way to a newfound sense of freedom as Tamko began to focus less on industry pressures and more on honing her craft as a songwriter and producer. \"With this album, I wanted to impress myself,\" Tamko says. \"I wanted to be curious and I wanted to make big leaps as a producer. All I had access to on the road was my computer and Logic, so naturally I started writing songs electronically with what was at hand.\" All The Women In Me was written and produced entirely by Tamko. Guitar-driven melodies are largely absent, and in their place we are treated to a collection of songs buoyed by hybridized analog and digital arrangements. While Infinite Worlds situated the last Vagabon project in the realm of \"indie rock,\" All The Women In Me is not easily defined. Grounded by Tamko's expressive voice and knack for unique melodies, the album flits between genres, never lingering too long on one particular sensibility. Lead single \"Flood Hands\" exemplifies this growth; the production ebbs like a gentle tide before a cavernous drumbeat kicks in and the tone shifts completely. \"I know, even if I run from it I'm still in it,\" Tamko sings over and over again, her capacious voice conveying a sense of resignation in the face of an external force beyond her control. The chorus is a hypnotic bit of pop alchemy that lingers long after the runtime. \"The drums and vocal forward approach I took on All The Women In Me is drawn from my love for rap and hip-hop production as well as R&B and folk storytelling. That's the music that got me excited about writing again,\" Tamko says. In addition to those influences, the West African guitars and rhythms that soundtracked much of her childhood seep into moments throughout this album, in no place more obvious than on \"In A Bind.\" The song opens with a fingerpicked melody as Tamko sings to someone she's been orbiting for a while but can't quite reach. \"I know that I was gone a lot last year/ But I hoped you'd still be here,\" she sings. After that, words no longer serve, and lyrics are replaced by robust, choral vocals singing the refrain: \"Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.\" \"I drew some inspiration from the Malian musician Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 while writing that song. There is a part on his song 'Savane' where he and his band are feeling the music so much that he just says, 'Yes,' in the middle of the track,\" Tamko explains. \"It's almost as if the music is coming from a higher power. That's a staple in so much of the African music I love, and when I started writing 'In a Bind' I was overcome in a similar way.\" Tamko didn't set out with one particular lyrical theme in mind when she started writing All The Women In Me, and as a result, this album offers up a spectrum of moods to marinate in. Songs like the album's opener \"Full Moon In Gemini,\" the thumping bedroom dance track \"Water Me Down,\" and the collage piece \"Please Don't Leave The Table\" illustrate blinding moments of personal insight that speak to universal themes. Other lyrics came to Tamko with clear intention. Inspired by a Nayyirah Waheed poem, the title track, \"All The Women,\" is a thesis statement, though it arrives near the very end of the album. \"This song poured out of me and showed itself as an anthem for myself and for all of the people who are marginalized by our society. 'Women' in this case isn't gendered, it's a placeholder for those who are not always welcome and not always protected. This song exists for all of us to see each other and find each other,\" Tamko says. \"The song is also a thank-you letter to the women who raised me, the women who look like me, the women who work in all of the genres of music that guided this album, 'the women who run with the wolves.'\" On \"Wits About You,\" Tamko opens up more space for those who have found themselves positioned as The Other when she sings: \"I was invited to the party/ They won't let my people in/ Well then never mind, never mind, never mind.\" Later, the stunning slow burn \"Home Soon\" finds Tamko meditating on what it feels like to truly belong to a place, a community. She's joined by a consortium of friends, who sing along with her over a trembling string arrangement. \"At dawn, I'll be home soon,\" they affirm in unison. \"Home has always been a major theme in my music, and when I say I make music for outcasts, I am also talking about those who feel far from home or uncomfortable where they're at,\" Tamko says. \"To me, home isn't a physical space so much as it is a mental state. I'm writing about wanting to feel safe and at home in my body and in my mind and in the community I move in. I want Vagabon to be a project that people searching for the same thing can connect with.\"", "otherInfo": "Vagabon"}, {"Address": "487 Atlantic Ave, Kings County, NY 11217", "Artist": "Nathan MacIntosh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617396.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.68592140000001, -73.9816178], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "EastVille Comedy Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022638337-nathan-macintosh-at-eastville-comedy-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4 Pennsylvania Plz, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Run The Jewels ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7617835.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7505621, -73.99347089999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Madison Square Garden", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1020308279-run-the-jewels-at-madison-square-garden?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "In 2012, El-P produced Killer Mike's critically acclaimed album R.A.P.

Self-taught and trained by the New Jersey bar scene, Tobin owes much of his high-energy performances to his time spent busking on the streets of Galway, Ireland throughout 2015 and 2017. In 2017, Tobin graduated college with a degree in writing. Having expected to become a novelist, his business as a musician began to overshadow his prose. Uncertain of his future, Tobin walked El Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trail through Spain, with his guitar tied to his pack. Upon the trail's completion, the future became obvious. Sean returned to New Jersey in the fall of 2017 where he worked a 9-5 job to fund his music. He released his first album, This Midnight, in 2018. The next year he played Frank Turner's Lost Evenings III in Boston, MA. Later in 2019, Sean released Dreams & Black Caffeine, a four-song EP recorded with his band, The Boardwalk Fire. The group played several shows promoting the EP and planned a tour for 2020, but were forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

If intergalactic energy beings, upon their initiation into an order of whirling dervishes, built a pan-dimensional booty-shaking engine powered by psychedelic math...it would sound like a cut-rate CTS cover band. With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers. Their latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity. From the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound. This is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove. CTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents.

His undergraduate study was done at St. John's College in Annapolis, MD. After varying roles in various bands, Marunas decided to take the stage as a solo act. He became deft at synths, samplers, and recording, and began crafting songs that would come to life as the Baby Dayliner stage show. Baby Dayliner has released two albums on Brassland, High Heart & Low Estate and 2006's Critics Pass Away. INFLUENCES: Marunas' first big sonic influence was classical music that his parents and private teachers fed him as a child violinist (age 7-17). Later came jazz and hip-hop records. Strangely enough, his first pop music love was Hall and Oates, which he listened to alongside Kabuki theater music and other diverse sounds. RIYL: Serge Gainsbourg, Frank Sinatra, James Brown, New Order, David Bowie, Daft Punk, The Smiths, Stephin Merritt.

La m\u00fasica ya lo hab\u00eda atenazado desde que un compa\u00f1ero del colegio le propuso ser parte de la banda de rock que ten\u00eda junto con sus hermanos. La banda se llamaba Tercer Mundo. Ese fue el comienzo. Diez a\u00f1os de giras enloquecidas, fan\u00e1ticas adolescentes al borde de la histeria, camisas ra\u00eddas y mil historias compartidas en el camino, fueron suficientes y le llevaron a decidir buscar su propio camino, solo. As\u00ed comenz\u00f3 a hilvanar su primer \u00e1lbum: Para que no me olvides . Clasific\u00f3 al Cuadrag\u00e9simo Festival de Vi\u00f1a del Mar (1999) precisamente con la canci\u00f3n que le dio nombre a este \u00e1lbum y que tuvo gran acogida en su pa\u00eds, logrando Disco de Oro por ventas y situ\u00e1ndose en los primeros lugares de popularidad. Cuando empezaba a pensar en su siguiente trabajo, Para que no me olvides se filtr\u00f3 en Colombia y se volvi\u00f3 un \u00e9xito, logrando esta vez Disco de Platino y renombre internacional. A partir de all\u00ed se iniciar\u00eda una fuerte relaci\u00f3n del cantautor con Colombia. En el 2002 public\u00f3 su segundo \u00e1lbum, Tanto Amor , que muestra a Juan Fernando Velasco como un m\u00fasico y productor creativo, capaz de imprimir matices y propuestas musicales innovadoras en cada canci\u00f3n. Chao Lola , Dicen , Hoy que no est\u00e1s , Si alguna vez te am\u00e9 y Salud se ubican en los primeros lugares en las listas de popularidad en los pa\u00edses en los que se hab\u00eda publicado este segundo \u00e1lbum (Ecuador, Colombia, Panam\u00e1, Guatemala y Costa Rica), logrando nuevamente Disco de Platino en Colombia y en Ecuador. Aqu\u00ed se inicia una extensa gira de conciertos masivos con localidades agotadas en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, confirmando que Velasco no s\u00f3lo vende, sino que es capaz de atrapar a audiencias muy diversas que encuentran en \u00e9l y en su m\u00fasica una propuesta novedosa, seria y genuina. En el 2006 Juan Fernando realiz\u00f3 varias presentaciones importantes, entre ellas, la realizada junto a Franco de Vita en el Madison Square Garden de la ciudad de Nueva York en Febrero pasado. Adem\u00e1s de estos logros profesionales, su lado humano y su compromiso social son reconocidos con diferentes condecoraciones y nombramientos. Entre ellos, los dos m\u00e1s importantes: la Orden Vicente Rocafuerte (2004), m\u00e1ximo reconocimiento que entrega el Congreso del Ecuador al M\u00e9rito Art\u00edstico, y la designaci\u00f3n como Embajador de la Paz y la Ternura (2004) por parte de la Plataforma Interamericana de Derechos Humanos. Juan Fernando presenta ahora su tercer \u00e1lbum: \u201cA tu lado\u201d. \u00c9ste esperado nuevo disco contiene contribuciones de Jorge Villamizar de Bacilos y del rapero Gerardo Mej\u00eda, adem\u00e1s de la participaci\u00f3n de connotados musicos e ingenieros, como Pich\u00f3n Dal Pont, Mario Breuer, Xavier Garza, Carlos Villavicencio y el productor 4 veces ganador del Grammy Andr\u00e9s Castro, entre otros. Actualmente Juan Fernando reside en Miami y prepara una extensa gira promocional por M\u00e9xico y Estados Unidos, donde \u201cA tu lado\u201d promete ser el primer paso en el crecimiento en esos pa\u00edses de \u00e9ste arstista que en el resto de latinoamerica es ya un hito.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "DJ Snake ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11410934.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.710677, -73.92635039999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop, Trap, Dance Music, Hip Hop", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Mirage", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102687465-dj-snake-at-brooklyn-mirage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Snake is a French producer at the forefront of the electronic music movement, having taken the genre to the charts with his 2013 single \"Turn Down for What\" featuring Lil Jon.

He is always trying to stretch, grow, and in turn, hone his sound. The writer, producer, singer and multi-instrumentalist, was raised in Upstate NY. Kevin began assembling bands in high school and started playing gigs on the weekends. He found himself jamming with adult musicians and being able to keep up. \u201cThat\u2019s how I started learning how to connect with audiences, and how to create music,\u201d he says. Kevin has a virtuosic gift when it comes to the guitar, but not one to be pinned down, he plays several other instruments as well. In his late teens, Kevin Andreas began teaching guitar lessons and learning audio engineering. At the age of twenty-two he was able to relocate to New York City and opened his own recording studio in Williamsburg. Kevin spent time behind the spotlight as a sideman, studio musician, singer/writer, and producer. During this time, he co-wrote and sang the hook on, A$AP Rocky\u2019s breakout hit, \u201cPeso.\u201d He is also the musical director for comedienne Sandra Bernhard. Andreas released an introductory project for fans that took off beyond expectation. Vents Magazine called it \u201csexy, haunting and utterly awesome\u201d while Paste Magazine cited the song as an \u201cempowering anthem that combines energetic instrumentation and rock bombast with a soft, soulful melody.\u201d A track was featured on Filtr\u2019s Spotify \u201cNEW MUSIC\u201d playlist, as well as Filtr\u2019s \u201cArtists to Watch\u201d Spotify playlist. By late 2016, the track had garnered enough acclaim to warrant Spotify to place it on \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d leading the track to garner 75k+ streams, all while still completely independent. Kevin just released his brand new single, \u201cFRIEND$\u201d in July of 2017. The new track has a soulful summer vibe, that features a catchy hook and an undeniable bouncy beat. Kevin was chosen to perform as direct support for Sabrina Carpenter (Hollywood Records) at Musikfest, and has also opened for Andy Grammer. He has performed at notable NYC venues such as Highline Ballroom, Brooklyn Bowl, Gramercy Theater and Webster Hall. Kevin continues to perform in and around NYC and will be touring this upcoming fall / winter. Andreas is currently finishing up his debut solo LP and is looking to release the album in the coming months. Tracks featuring Andreas\u2019 otherworldly guitar playing, along with his contemporary pop and hip-hop sensibilities, will be highlighted on the LP. The new single \u201cFRIEND$\u201d and the forthcoming album are poised to launch Andreas to a larger audience and continued success.

He began studying the piano at the age of eight, and five years later switched to electric guitar. He soon discovered his passion for improvisation and jazz, and during his high school years he began to travel regularly to Tel Aviv to study with Israel\u2019s leading musicians, and to participate in workshops and master classes. At the age of 16 he started performing professionally with jazz bands around the country and leading several projects with his original music. At 19, Yuval wrote an original composition for his hometown\u2019s string quartet and for the renowned Oud and Violin player Yair Dalal. His music was selected by one of Israel\u2019s leading composers and music educators Michael Wolpe, and was performed in concert halls across Israel. Soon afterwards he started studying at The Jerusalem Academy of Music and the Rimon Jazz School in Tel Aviv and participated in various musical projects. In 2005 Yuval moved to Paris. He quickly made his way into the local jazz scene and started playing in Paris clubs and venues. The following year he studied at the Jazz department of the Paris Region Conservatory, graduating two years later. Since 2008 Yuval leads his quintet, the Yuval Amihai Ensemble, with whom he performs music which is strongly influenced by his childhood in Israel. The ensemble has won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize and the 1st composition prize at the \"La D\u00e9fense\" National Jazz Competition in 2009, The 1st prize in the Saint-Germain Jazz festival Contest in Paris (2008), and the 3rd prize in the international jazz competition of Hoeilaart, Belgium. The band has performed in opening act concerts for renowned artists as Avishai Cohen, Bojan Z, Rabia Abu-Khalil and Kyle Eastwood, and played in numerous Jazz festivals, concert halls and jazz clubs in France and Europe, including Nancy Jazz Pulsations, La D\u00e9fense Jazz Festival, Sunset/Sunside Jazz Club (Paris), Jazz \u00e0 Staint-G\u00e9rmain-des-Pr\u00e8s Festival (Paris), Guitar Art Caf\u00e9 (Belgrade, Serbie), Budo Tomovic Theater (Podgorica, Mont\u00e9n\u00e9gro), National theaters of Amiens, Sceaux & Valencienne. In 2012 Yuval released his first album with his quintet, \"Yuval Amihai Ensemble\", which was acclaimed by critics and received the \"Chosen Album\" label by French leading jazz critics website CitizenJazz.com. This was followed by a full support by the SACEM organisation's grants program for self-produced albums. In 2015, Yuval records his second album \"LONGING\" with his new trio, including bass player Damien Varaillon and drummer Gautier Garrigue. The album was released May 25, 2015 (distributed by L'Autre Distribution). Acclaimed by critics it receives the \"Chosen album\u201d label by CitizenJazz.com as well as the \u201cDiscovery\u201d label in the Jazz News magazine.

However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are, in fact, a few fucks the guys do give when it comes to their music. Which they have no problem showing.In the studio, Sedz and Fish channel their unabashed, fuck-all attitudes into tracks like their sultry debut single \u201cFace Down\u201d, and the lush vocal cut \u201cEcho\u201d. The guys coin an atmospheric and deep-leaning sound that\u2019s suited to no one particular environment. As Fish tells it, \u201cyou should be able to enjoy it everywhere.\u201d Mates since childhood, Cut Snake grew up on the Gold Coast of Australia; surfing professionally and competing against each other from the time they were 12. In this time, they developed the hilarious banter and incredible dynamic that is still prevalent in interviews and on stage. The guys got into dance music while they were touring the world for surf contests and quickly grew passionate about the underground scenes from each country they visited. With plenty of time waiting for waves, they fine-tuned their production skills from beachfront bungalows, giving their music a fresh feel and their live show a vibe like no other. Outside of their wildly successful surf careers, Sedz channeled his passion and focus for the sport into his music production, and for that he\u2019s known as the \u201cmad scientist\u201d of the duo. Fish is known for his web series, Followthefish.tv. His wild personality and contagious laugh have made him one of the biggest personalities in the surfing industry to date. Now that Cut Snake has relocated stateside and inked a deal with Three Six Zero / Warner Bros. Records, the guys flout the seriousness of the scene in every way possible. Their crazy video antics have amassed a cult following in their home country of Australia and given the guys an edge on US turf. The edge, of course, is in teaching their American audience how to take a break from their day jobs and have a fucking beer...or seven.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "110 Ocean Ave, Long Branch, NJ 07740", "Artist": "Matt Cook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9174124.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.2993533, -73.9794217], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Electronic, Indie Pop, Indie Folk", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Wave Resort", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102779097-matt-cook-at-wave-resort?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Heartfelt, melancholy, exuberant and aggressive contribute to the all-around uniqueness of New Jersey Shore based indie/alternative singer/songwriter Matt Cook.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1401 NJ-35, Neptune City, NJ 07753", "Artist": "Louie DeVito ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11519506.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.188543, -74.0257587], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "House Music", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Louie DeVito's Dance Factory", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102747625-louie-devito-at-oasis-pool-and-day-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Club-goers and dance music fans in the New York Metro area know him and flock to hear his sets. He\u2019s been a staple in the NY/NJ club scene going on 20 years. For a DJ-Producer, that\u2019s a lifetime. But for Louie DeVito, it is simply his life. On any given weekend night, he can be found playing sets to packed rooms, wall-to-wall bodies writhing on the dance floor. That is when DeVito is his happiest. \u201cI love feeling the vibe of the room,\u201d he explains. Big or small, domestic or international, he loves them all. \u201cI\u2019ve played rooms of 350 to rooms of thousands. Playing good music, reading the crowd, giving them what they want \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d That ideology of \u201cgiving them what they want\u201d has made him seem like a \u201csellout\u201d to some of his fellow DJs. His compilation \u201cN.Y.C. Underground Party,\u201d released on his own independent label Elastik, has sold more than 500,000 copies to date \u2013 enough to land him in the Guinness Book of World Records for all-time best-selling DJ mix compilation. Ironically, there\u2019s nothing \u201cunderground\u201d about the mix. DeVito admits this himself, laughing about it. \u201cFor the hardcore, serious clubber, there is nothing \u2018underground\u2019 about it. But it depends on who you\u2019re asking. For the average mainstream clubber, it\u2019s very underground \u2013 no dance remixes of pop hits here.\u201d DeVito\u2019s bread and butter comes from catering to a crowd craving an indulgent blend of radio-friendly club smashes. Big dance anthems with soaring vocals and huge stadium-sizes synths and riffs, with the requisite massive build-up and break. \u201cThis big room sound is what I\u2019m into playing these days,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely popular. It also sounds good on any and every sound system. I want to see hands in the air, people dancing and going crazy. This sound makes it happen.\u201d DeVito recently released a remix of Sweet Rains feat. Reina \u201cForever\u201d on indie label Lafayette Street Records. \u201cReina\u2019s big vocals on this track leant itself to a big-room, anthemic remix. I worked with my partner Alessandro Calemme.

An adroit and sensitive accompanist as well as an imaginative bandleader, Yeager has released five albums of original music to wide acclaim, including All At Onceness (with Randal Despommier) and United (with Jason Anick), the latter of which was named a Best Album of 2017 by Downbeat Magazine. His newest album, New Songs of Resistance (Outside in Music, 2019) features chamber-jazz arrangements of songs by nueva canci\u00f3n icons like Victor Jara, Violeta Parra, and Le\u00f3n Gieco, as well as original compositions. The Boston Globe describes the recording as a \"musical reflection of troubled times and a search for affirmation nonetheless,\" and the New York Music Daily hails it as \"searingly relevant\" and \"one of the best albums of 2019 in any style of music.\" As a bandleader and soloist, Yeager has performed at such venues as Carnegie Hall, the Blue Note, and Smalls Jazz Club, as well as at festivals, concert halls, and clubs throughout the United States, South America, Asia, and Southern Africa. Yeager was also a finalist in the 2019 Jacksonville Jazz Piano Competition, the 2017 International Songwriting Competition, and winner of the 2014 Hot House Jazz Fans Decision Awards for best pianist. He has also worked with iconic, cutting-edge jazz artists like Luciana Souza, Greg Osby, Ayn Inserto, George Garzone, Sean Jones, Linda Oh, Noah Preminger, Sara Serpa, Fernando Huergo, Mark Walker, Rudresh Mahanthappa, and Matt Wilson.

She was born Karen Michelle Johnston on February 24, 1962, in Dallas, Texas, the daughter of a carpenter and a woman who would end up committing her to a psychiatric hospital twenty-something years later. She graduated from high school in Gilmer, Texas and received her bachelor's degree in the Oral Interpretation of Poetry from the University of Texas in Austin. She was raised in a strict Mormon household and worked her way through college to pay for tuition. Michelle's stage name dates back to the name she gave when arrested in 1984 at a protest for fair housing during the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, California. Her nickname was 'Chel, so Michelle Shocked was a play on words intended to resemble the phrase \"shell shocked\". The front cover of her (arguably) best-known album, Short Sharp Shocked, shows her restrained by the chokehold of a San Francisco policeman in a supposedly authentic photograph of this incident. However, some indie music critics of the time observed that the style of this image showed a strong similarity to a photo that appeared on an album cover from British punk band Chaos UK. This led some to assert that she plagiarized the concept, but the accusation was never answered nor seriously pursued.

There is a vine, Liana, which grows from tree to tree, holding the forest together through all of nature\u2019s changing moods. These vines form a net, which hovers 20 or so feet above ground level. Monkeys and other adventurous life forms often jump from great heights only to land comfortably in this net of vines. Liana can become so heavy, that it pulls down older and weaker trees, constantly catalyzing new life in the rain forest. For the Ghanaian people, Liana has been a symbol of strength and unity, across a great network of life. Joe Galeota brought me to Ghana in 2003 as part of his annual trip to experience Ewe music, dance and culture. We studied at the Dagbe Cultural Center with the Agbeli family in Kopeiya, a village in the southeastern Volta region. We were introduced to the ancestors of the Agbeli family and their land. We studied with master drummer Emmanuel Agbeli and lead dancer Victor Agbeli. While in Ghana we also had the privilege to study at the Dargara Bewaa Cultural Center, outside of Accra. This is the house of master xylophonist Bernard Woma. We studied the Gyil, a fourteen keyed balafon made from completely organic materials. The Gyil appears once on this record in the \u201cTodjo Suite\u201d. It was at Bernard\u2019s house where I began to arrange traditional Gyil music for the guitar. Upon returning to Philadelphia I continued to study and arrange what I had learned. In the blossoming Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia, I began to teach this music, holding weekly workshops for free. This naturally grew into a bi-weekly happening where the communal traditions of Ewe social music were performed. This ensemble became the group Leana Song. The way we spell Leana, was the way I pictured the word. Though traditionally spelled \u2018Liana\u2019, \u2018Leana\u2019 has meaning when you split the letters apart. Le, a term used for the raffia leggings worn by adjogbo (adzohu) dancers, and A\u00f1a, coming from the bat\u00e1 tradition and referring to the spirit within the drum. This works well because Ewe music brought Leana Song together and bat\u00e1 music has sustained us. This first volume of Orisha Love Songs, primarily has arrangements of Cuban Lucum\u00ed songs, with three arrangements of Ewe music. We look forward to creating the next volume of Orisha Love Songs, and we thank you for your support of our work. Ashe Moyuba.

Their impeccable musicianship and larger-than-life vocals have earned Roomful of Blues five Grammy Award nominations and a slew of other accolades, including seven Blues Music Awards. Twice, the prestigious DownBeat International Critics\u2019 Poll has selected them as Best Blues Band. And now, even after 18 previous releases and thousands of live shows, Roomful of Blues continues to evolve, as they return with In A Roomful Of Blues, their first new studio album since 2011. In A Roomful Of Blues, the band\u2019s sixth release on Alligator Records, was produced by Vachon and features 13 wide-ranging songs, including nine band-composed originals\u2014more than on any previous Roomful album. Eight songs were written or co-written by Vachon (including one authored with vocalist Phil Pemberton) plus one each by sax player Alek Razdan and keyboardist Rusty Scott. From the rocking We\u2019d Have A Love Sublime to the funkified You Move Me to the closing-time lament She Quit Me Again to the up-to-the-minute Phone Zombies, In A Roomful Of Blues is filled with soaring blues, zydeco twists, late-night ballads, Latin-tinged funk and a touch of vintage, fifth-gear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Roomful of Blues guitarist Chris Vachon first joined Roomful in 1990, and has been leading the band since 1998. Guitar Player says Vachon\u2019s guitar playing \u201cburns with explosive solos and a delightfully greasy sense of rhythm.\u201d The band has maintained its signature sound through great musicianship and a stellar horn section\u2014featuring tenor and alto saxophonist Rich Lataille, who first joined the band in 1970. Lataille\u2019s masterful playing can evoke either the fat-toned, honking sax of the glory days of early rock or the cool elegance of big band swing jazz. While Roomful of Blues has always been one of the tightest, most joyful blues ensembles in the world, they have never sounded fresher or stronger than with the current line-up. Along with Vachon and Lataille, the band includes vocalist Phil Pemberton, baritone and tenor saxophonist Alek Razdan, trumpeter Carl \u201cGeerz\u201d Gerhard, bassist John Turner, drummer Chris Anzalone and keyboardist Rusty Scott. The long and winding road which leads to the Roomful of Blues of today can be followed all the way back to 1967 when a group of southern Rhode Island teenagers with a shared passion for the blues formed a straight-ahead Chicago-style electric blues band to explore the music of their heroes. They added a horn section (including Rich Lataille) in 1970 and released their self-titled debut album in 1977 on Island Records (reissued on Hyena Records), which brought them to the attention of fans and critics from coast to coast. Recording for Rounder Records\u2019 Bullseye Blues and Varrick labels between 1980 and 2001, the band cut nine albums that won them international fame and major rock radio airplay. They\u2019ve gigged with stars ranging from bluesmen B.B. King, Otis Rush and Stevie Ray Vaughan to rockers Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana. The band has performed in cities from coast to coast, and traveled abroad to 22 countries including Lebanon, Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and Russia. Since Roomful joined the Alligator Records family in 2003, their popularity has continued to increase. Their first Alligator CD was the Grammy-nominated That\u2019s Right! in 2003, followed by Standing Room Only in 2005, Raisin\u2019 A Ruckus in 2008, Hook, Line & Sinker in 2010 and 45 Live in 2013. All five albums received massive amounts of critical and popular praise and kept old and new fans lining up to see them perform. The New Yorker says the band brings \u201cthunderous performances that get feet stomping and hands clapping.\u201d With In A Roomful Of Blues, the band has once again captured all of their frenetic energy and musical power in the studio. Roomful of Blues will be hitting the road and bringing the new material to their fans around the world, proving without doubt that this is a band built to stand the test of time. While keenly aware of the group\u2019s half century of history, Vachon is quick to note, however, that they are constantly looking forward. \u201cWe always keep things fresh and we keep the excitement level high. Playing this music is an immense amount of fun for us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just as much fun for our audience.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "55 Christopher St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Jared Schonig ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8503721.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.733834, -74.0022552], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Duchess @ 55 Bar", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102798226-jared-schonig-at-55-bar?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Born 1983 in Los Angeles, CA to a family of professional musicians, Jared Schonig began playing the piano at age 5 and the drums at age 14.

His earliest exposure to music came at home, thanks to an extended family of musicians and ready access to a wealth of Colombian genres. By the age of 12, Torres was performing with various Bogot\u00e1 ensembles, developing techniques that allowed him to quickly adapt to the demands of jazz, pop music, and salsa. A classically trained percussionist, he earned a degree in Music Composition from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s esteemed Universidad Javeriana. Before departing for the U.S. in 1999, the resourceful young artist had become an established figure on Colombia\u2019s fertile music scene, backing leading Colombian performers while serving as an arranger and music director for his country\u2019s highly regarded telenovelas (TV soap operas) and films.\nShortly after arriving in the U.S., his career took a dramatic turn when he was tapped by famed trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval to join his group.

The quartet of Horvath, guitarist Dave Whitehead, drummer Chris Ryan and bassist Christopher Rousseau enthralls listeners with irresistible hooks and captivates them with intelligent layers of sound. In 2001, The Council released its debut album Coloursound (The Sinclair Recording Co.). Coloursound made its radio debut on Little Steven\u2019s internationally syndicated radio show \u201cUnderground Garage\" and the first single \u201cSitting on a Cloud\u201d, was named the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d in April 2002. In 2006 the band released its second full-length album, The Fall Parade (Groove Disques Records), which was nominated for \u201cBest New Release\u201d and \u201cBest Album\u201d by the Asbury Park Music Awards. The album quickly made its way to the Billboard Garage Rock charts on the strength of its first single \u201cPinkerton\u2019s Assorted Colours\u201d which entered at number one and propelled the The Fall Parade to number nine. Both the single and album remained in the Top 10 charting for three months straight. The second single \u201cStrawberry Smell\u201d, which is featured on the soundtrack of award-winning film I\u2019m Reed Fish (2007), continues to spin regularly on Underground Garage and radio stations across North America. In 2012 The Anderson Council completed and released their 3rd full length album, Looking at the Stars. Recorded in Highland Park, New Jersey by Kurt Reil (leader of the Grip Weeds, and producer of Mark Lindsey and The Smithereens) on Sinclair Records, \u201cLooking at the Stars\u201d featured 13 new songs ranging from high-energy 60\u2019s power pop to 70\u2019s Mod Revival to 00\u2019s British re-invasion. Their video for the single and lead off track \"Don't You Think\" received extensive views online on YouTube and in the blogosphere. The single also appeared in the Canadian film The Right Kind of Wrong (2013). The record continued to surge, behind the support Little Steven Van Zandt, who deemed a deeper cut, \"Gardening Man\" the \u201cCoolest Song in the World\u201d on his Underground Garage Sirius XM radio (channel 21) and syndicated radio show. Combine that with a public endorsement from Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, annual appearances at multiple metro area music festivals and all was looking good in the power pop world for The Anderson Council. Over the next two years, the band stayed busy and productive playing shows and kept their name in the public eye. They made appearances on several tribute records, recording their versions of songs by Elvis Costello, Bobby Sutliff, The Posies, New Jersey\u2019s own, The Critters and most recently, the Canadian rock band, Sloan. In 2014 Christopher Rousseau joined the fold, taking over bass duties from long time member Rob Farrell. Energized, the band brought Christopher up to speed, and later that year, the band embarked on writing and demoing new material. The result is 2015\u2019s Listening Party!, a six song EP which gave their fans some well deserved tracks to spin while awaiting the next album. The EP tracklisting was unique in that each member contributed one original and chose one cover. In 2016, fresh from signing with Marty Scott\u2019s JEM Records, the band re entered The House of Vibes to cut some tracks. Scott\u2019s intention was to introduce the rest of the world to the sounds of The Anderson Council without having to purchase their catalog. Thus the idea behind Assorted Colours, an aural history of The Anderson Council was born. Under the stewardship of Reil, the band began a massive re-mastering of tracks from the first three albums. With the intention of including three tracks from each previously release along with 4 newly recorded \u201cjems\u201d.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Stephen's new album titled \"Said & Done\" was released on February 27, 2016. The new LP draws on inspiration from his time in the southern United States as well as pop and Americana styles. Stephen began his musical career as a drummer, and his transition to a songwriter has weaved a percussive element into his guitar playing and singing. Since humble beginnings as a solo act around Central New York, Stephen has since finely tuned the performance and arrangement of his songs to compliment both bold full band shows and intimate acoustic events. Stephen\u2019s live shows distinctly blend singer-songwriter charm and comedic wit, leaving listeners wanting more. Encore Magazine says, \u201cWhether his lyrics flourish with optimism or heartache, Stephen Babcock\u2019s music infuses the listener with an all-encompassing positive feeling\u201d.

Stephen\u2019s EP, \u201cWishful Thinking,\u201d was written and recorded upon returning home from touring and was released in May 2014. After taking the following winter to write and record, Stephen took another full tour of the southern US in the summer of 2015.

Orleans began as a trio in 1972 in Woodstock NY. Guitarist John Hall, drummer Wells Kelly and multi-instrumentalist Larry Hoppen played tirelessly all over the Northeast and up / down the Eastern \u201ccorridor\u201d for nine months, then added Lance Hoppen (Larry\u2019s brother) fresh out of high school on bass to form the quartet that would record its debut LP in 1973 at the legendary Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama. Orleans found its core audience touring the clubs and college circuit of the Northeast US, crossing paths with other up-and-comers such as Bonnie Raitt, Tom Waits, and Hall & Oates. Rolling Stone called Orleans \"the best unrecorded band in America\". Showcase performances in NYC gave rise to a recording contract with ABC Dunhill Records and the release of an eponymous debut album in 1973. But it was not until Orleans was produced by Chuck Plotkin, then head of A&R for Asylum Records, that the band scored its first Top 40 hit with \"Let There Be Music\" in early 1975. The follow up single \"Dance With Me\" brought Orleans into the Top 5 and the mainstream of American pop music. Atypical of the high-energy, earthy, R&B/Rock 'n' Roll mix of styles they had been previously identified with, \"Dance With Me\" cast the band in a more \"soft-rock\" light and landed them a tour with Melissa Manchester, when they really were more at home on tour with bands such as Little Feat. It was the smash hit \"Still the One\" that cemented Orleans' relationship with the American public. While the single was climbing the charts all the way to #2, the band did a major cross-country tour with label-mate Jackson Browne. However, within a year internal stresses prompted guitarist/songwriter Hall to leave the band in search of a solo career, as \"Still the One\" played ceaselessly as the ABC TV network theme song. Since then it has been used for countless commercials and movie soundtracks. The Hoppen brothers and Kelly reunited the band and, in 1979, produced the Top 10 hit \"Love Takes Time\", continuing to tour with the likes of Stephen Stills and Chicago. Collectively, the three Orleans' hits have been aired over 7 million times. One of the many signatures of Orleans was and still is harmony guitar riffs and two serious players trading rhythm and lead between them, all seamlessly. Larry and John were, for most of this still\u2013active band\u2019s 35-year-and\u2013counting career, those players. When John Hall left for a solo stint in 1977, Orleans found Dennis \u201cFly\u2019 Amero, a lefty, upside-down Strat player (in the manner of Jimi Hendrix) who took over for several years. After original drummer Wells Kelly passed away in October 1984, Larry, Lance and John played at his Memorial event. Out of this, they decided to work together as Orleans again, starting with a Nashville album. From 1985 through 2006 (when John got elected to the US Congress \u2013 D, NY-19) the group always included the three original members. Over those years, another 8 albums were released, always containing new material. In 2001 the band added Lane Hoppen, the third brother, as a permanent member. Shortly after, Charlie Morgan \u2013 drummer with Elton John for 13 years \u2013 also joined the group. Early in 2006, as John Hall began his election campaign, Fly Amero was asked back by the band \u2013 including John - roughly 25 years after Fly\u2019s first \u2018term\u2019. Fly agreed, and a smooth transition ensued. (Orleans\u2019 2006 \u201cWe\u2019re Still Havin\u2019 Fun\u201d DVD features BOTH John and Fly.) Fly and Larry\u2019s guitar chemistry is obvious, as is the whole group\u2019s camaraderie. Besides being a great guitarist, songwriter and singer with a strong blues/R&B soulful tilt, Fly is great with a crowd and has a Gold Record for comedy music featuring his parody lyrics. Here in 2008, John is up for Congressional re-election and Fly is a permanent Orleans member, as are Charlie, Lane and original mainstays Lance and Larry (who is the voice on all the radio hits, by the way). Thirty-five years in, Orleans\u2019 trademarked slogan couldn\u2019t be more appropriate: \u201cWe\u2019re Still Havin\u2019 Fun\u201d.

A native of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Keezer was playing in jazz clubs as a teenager, holding down the piano chair for Art Blakey at age 18, and touring in the company of Ray Brown, Joshua Redman, Diana Krall, Art Farmer, Benny Golson and Barbara Hendricks in his 20s. More recently he has toured with Wayne Shorter, Dianne Reeves, David Sanborn, Chris Botti, Sting, Joe Locke and Christian McBride; produced and arranged three GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated recordings with vocalist Denise Donatelli, and released a series of albums drawing influences from Hawaiian, Okinawan and Afro-Peruvian folk traditions. His 2009 album \u00c1urea (ArtistShare) was nominated for a Best Latin Jazz Album GRAMMY\u00ae award. Geoffrey\u2019s 2013 solo piano release, Heart of the Piano (Motema Records), seeks to redefine solo jazz piano as a personal and interactive showcase of melody, energy and groove, while his latest album On My Way to You (MarKeez Records 2018) is a stunning new set of music featuring his working trio with the addition of guest vocalist Gillian Margot. Geoffrey\u2019s compositions have been commissioned by the Mainly Mozart Festival, Art of El\u00e1n ensemble, Saint Joseph Ballet, Zeltsman Marimba Festival, Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra and Scottish National Jazz Orchestra. His music can be heard in the films What Happens in Vegas and Inhale, and in numerous TV shows including The Young and the Restless (CBS), Parks and Recreation (NBC), House of Lies (Showtime), and Casual (Hulu Original).

Some voices you hear\u2026others you feel\u2026few artists, let alone singer-songwriters, possess the ability to seductively draw in a listener and then knock them out with a one-two punch\u2026Enter Nicola. Her blend of rock, pop & soul is of the strong female caliber; like Bonnie Raitt and K.T. Tunstall\u2026but make no mistake\u2026Nicola is Nicola. She is an accomplished singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and dancer, who has spent the last 10 years as a professional busker and musician in the NYC underground (as part of the sponsored \u201cMusic Under NY\u201d program). She has found an intimacy that can only exist where the constant rumble of trains drowns out most conversations, where the largest and toughest audiences in the world rush by, where you have to be damn good or you don\u2019t get to come back. This power house of a woman, rocks the New York underground like no other, but she\u2019s been rocking big stages and arenas above ground too. Born on the Lower East Side of NYC, Nicola grew up in the low-income projects, sharing toys with her baby brother. Her father was a mechanic, and her mother a nurse. Neither was musically inclined, but both shared their appreciation and love for all types of music with their kids. \u201cMusic was always playing in our house\u2026we grew up with the sounds of Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell, The Beatles,\u201d she recalls. It definitely rubbed off. Nicola ended up with a guitar in hand at age 7, a piano at age 11, and attended The Fiorello High School of the Arts (\u201cFame\u201d School). She trained classically at Manhattan School of Music and Queens College while studying dance and acting on the side. It wasn\u2019t long before she landed roles in both the critically acclaimed Broadway and National Road Companies of Les Miserables. Leaving the theater to embark on a music career, Nicola started her own record label \u201cHot Cherry Records\u201d in 2002. She toured the country and spent time living and performing in Europe and South America. Having recently opened for Eve 6, Nicola has shared the stage with Ricky Martin & Muzz Skillings of \u201cLiving Color\u201d. Over the past few years and 4 independently released CDs, having sold over 50,000 units independently, and charted on over 200 national radio stations, Nicola with her hybrid brand of sultry pop/rock/soul music has racked up an impressive list of rock and pop credentials: she's been featured on ABC, CBS & NBC News, Oxygen\u2019s \u201cBad Girls Club\u201d, MTV, VH1, Women Who Rock Magazine, Songwriter Universe Magazine, EMI/Songcircle Music, National Songwriters Hall of Fame , and she's performed at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. While performing in the subway, Nicola was scouted by EMI, Sony and Billboard Magazine, and was featured and showcased twice in Billboard Magazine\u2019s \u201cUnderground LP\u201d section for Noteworthy Emerging Artists about to break. The lead singer of the popular band \u201cTOTR\u201d on Interscope Records heard her performing at Union Square not long ago, and asked her to sing on the album they were recording at that time. She was briefly signed with Star Crossed Artist Group (\"Third Eye Blind\") and opened up for \"Eve 6\" and Edwin McCain. Nicola is on the development as well as writing and performance teams for several original prospective Broadway-bound musicals, and is endorsed by Martin Guitars Artist Program, Lampifier Microphones and Dovetail Strings. Nicola\u2019s 5th. album \u201cCanyons and Cathedrals\u201d, released October 2012, was a very complete tapestry of some of her most poetic soulful pop/rock music yet. A unique sonic journey from start to finish, the album contains 14 compositions and even includes 1 instrumental piece. Nicola released her latest single \"Back in Pieces October 2017 which was co-written and co-produced by Matt Colligan. She is Composer/Lyricist for a new original Broadway-Bound Musical called \"We are Ameena\" with A2K Productions. Above or below ground \u2013 to experience Nicola live is to be drawn in completely by a high-energy pop/rock/soul mix of driving beats, melodies and intelligent lyrics. All this is anchored by her sizzling vocals and rhythmic guitar chops. Nicola\u2019s performances whether full band or \u201cunplugged\u201d reveal an innate ability not just to dazzle an audience with her fiery presence\u2026but to somehow make you part of it\u2026and that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026", "otherInfo": "Nicola live unplugged at Starving Artist Caf\u00e9 \n249 City Island Ave.\nBx, NY\nwww.starvingartistonline.com"}, {"Address": "315 Meserole St, Kings County, NY 11206", "Artist": "Itai Kriss ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11186684.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7090451, -73.93529769999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Salsa, Mambo, Charanga, Timba, Jazz, Latin Jazz, Son, World Fusion", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Quinteto Guataca at Aura Cocina", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102778904-itai-kriss-at-aura-cocina?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Itai Kriss, a Grammy nominated recording artist praised by Jazzwax as \u201cone of the most exciting new flutist-composers\u201d on the scene, commands a variety of musical genres with an eclectic style infused with Jazz, Latin and Middle Eastern sounds.

Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity).

Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend.

Adalberto's relaxed and flawless lead vocals are amongst the best in salsa, and for over two decades he has sessioned as a coro (chorus) singer on countless New York recordings. His early influences included the great Cuban vocalists Beny Mor\u00e9 and Miguelito Cun\u00ed (b. 8 May 1920, Pinar del R\u00edo, Cuba, d. 5 March 1984, Havana, Cuba). Santiago started his professional career singing with trios and playing bass and guitar. After stints with the bands of Chu\u00edto V\u00e9lez, Willie Rodr\u00edguez and Willie Rosario, his career really took off when he joined Ray Barretto's band. Between 1966-72, Adalberto made seven albums (excluding compilations) with Ray Barretto. In late 1972, Adalberto and four other members of Barretto's band departed to found Tipica 73. He appeared on three of their albums before disagreement over musical direction led him, and three other band members, to split during the mid-70s to form Los Kimbos. Meanwhile, Santiago sang lead vocals on two critically acclaimed charanga albums, \"Fantasia Africana/African Fantasy\" and \"Our Heritage - Nuestra Herencia\", by flautist, composer and producer Lou P\u00e9rez. Los Kimbos were reputed to be a tough working band and had a sound reminiscent of both the pre-split Ray Barretto band and Tipica 73. With them, Adalberto recorded 1976's \"Los Kimbos\" and \"The Big Kimbos With Adalberto Santiago\" in1977. That year he made his solo debut on \"Adalberto\", which was produced by Ray Barretto and contained two of his own compositions. Los Kimbos continued under the leadership of timbales player Orestes Vilat\u00f3 and released two further albums- \"Hoy y Ma\u00f1ana\" (1978) and \"Aquacero Ne Me Moja\" (1979). Santiago sang lead on one track on \"Louie Ram\u00edrez y sus Amigos\" by Louie Ram\u00edrez. In 1979, Adalberto and Ram\u00edrez co-produced his solo follow-up, \"Adalberto Featuring Popeye El Marino\". The same year, he reunited with Ray Barretto on \"Rican/Struction\". Ray produced Adalberto's next solo album, \"Feliz Me Siento\", the following year. Sonora Matancera member, Javier V\u00e1zquez, produced, arranged, directed and played piano on the rootsy Adalberto Santiago, which was Adalberto's contribution to the early 80s tipico (typical) salsa revival. In 1982, he teamed up with bandleader/bongo player Roberto Roena for \"Super Apollo\" 47:50. Santiago co-produced \"Calidad\" with Papo Lucca, who also played piano, arranged one track and oversaw musical direction. His \"Cosas Del Alma\" was an album of lush boleros which included his third recorded version of the classic 'Alma Con Alma' (previously contained on Barretto's \"The Message\" and \"Gracias\"). He returned to harder-edged urban salsa in 1985 on \"Mas Sabroso\". Adalberto did his own mature version of salsa rom\u00e1ntica on the classy Sex Symbol, with production, arrangements, musical direction and piano by the ubiquitous Isidro Infante. In 1990, he again performed 'Alma Con Alma', this time arranged by Infante in a salsa rom\u00e1ntica style for Louie Ram\u00edrez's second album entitled \"Louie Ram\u00edrez y sus Amigos\". Santiago has written songs for a number of the albums on which he has appeared, both as bandleader and solo artist, and provided compositions for other artists to record, such as Joe Cuba. Adalberto has remained true to his Latin roots and a statement he made in 1977 is still relevant in the 90s: 'I want to bring a truly Latin message to the people; this is what I do best and the structure of Latin music is best suited to my singing style'.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "115 Macdougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Outdoors ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7301811, -74.0007016], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Cafe Wha", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022543123-outdoors-at-cafe-wha?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "307 W 26th St, New York City, NY 10001", "Artist": "North Coast ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7476699, -73.9975237], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Asylum NYC", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022444889-north-coast-at-asylum-nyc?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "21 A Clinton St,, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Chi & Greg ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11605310.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7206573, -73.98436579999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Shoes Off, Mouth Off!", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102793832-chi-and-greg-at-caveat?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Chi & Greg are a Brooklyn-based duo made up of Chi Ko and Gregory Meyer.

Bram (drums) vervolledigde de band in de zomer van 2014. In deze bezetting schreef de band heel wat nieuwe nummers, wat midden 2015 resulteerde in een eerste online EP. Na de release hiervan speelden we op heel wat lokale festivals en muziekcaf\u00e9s in o.a. Antwerpen, Aalst, Gent, Ninove en zelfs Den Haag.

Amassing an army of instantly recognisable hit singles, with over 13 billion global streams, over 60 million singles sales, and 5 BRIT Award nominations, Jonas has cemented his name as a main stage DJ and pop powerhouse. With over one billion streams just in 2020, joining an elite list of artists including The 1975 and Niall Horan, Jonas\u2019 debut album Blue also smashed its way to Gold status. But, with 2021 now in full swing, he\u2019s not about to rest on his laurels. A man on a mission, whose sights are firmly set for the top, this year is the start of a new era of hard graft and perseverance. His story is one of self-belief, self-improvement and talent\u2026. 2018 was a landmark year. He released \u2018Rise\u2019 featuring Jack & Jack, which was one of the summer\u2019s biggest global hits and owned the autumn with \u2018Polaroid\u2019 - his highly-anticipated collaboration with Liam Payne and Nashville actress Lennon Stella. The success of both hits was sandwiched between his huge collaboration \u2018Back & Forth\u2019 with chart-topping UK vocalist Becky Hill and Detroit house legend, MK. Debut album Blue soon followed, which featured collaborations with the likes of fast-rising songstress Nina Nesbitt, platinum-selling Canadian artist Jessie Reyez, multi-skilled singer/songwriter Zak Abel, Charlotte OC, and Grammy award-winning Puerto Rican rapper Jhay Cortez, alongside his previous multi-platinum selling hits. Jonas\u2019 album was also the recipient of the Brit Certified Breakthrough Award the following year. Off the back of Blue, Jonas\u2019 hard work and inspiring music continued to receive global success with singles featuring a combo of hot new artists, as well as household names. These included the brilliant \u2018Younger\u2019 featuring HRVY, \u2018Mistakes\u2019 featuring Paloma Faith, \u2018Naked\u2019 featuring MAX, \u2018What I Like About You\u2019 featuring Danish popstar Theresa Rex and \u2018Ritual\u2019, his much-loved collaboration with Ti\u00ebsto and Rita Ora. At the height of a hectic Ibiza season in 2019, Jonas added another string to his bow with the launch of his label, Electronic Nature. Having already established successful events, as well as releases from emerging talent including Jack Wins, Dark Heart and Jerome Price with more to come, Electronic Nature is a label to watch. Away from the studio and the charts, Jonas toured relentlessly all over the world. Clocking up the hours and miles, he\u2019s a firm fixture on festival mainstages worldwide, performing at the most legendary festivals . Not stopping there, Jonas has made his mark on Ibiza, having performed at hotspots Ushuaia, Cafe Mambo and has successfully hosted his Electronic Nature residency at superclub H\u00ef Ibiza. As we see a return to live performances, Jonas will be joining Tiesto and Zedd as a resident DJ at Zouk in Las Vegas. Locked down or not, his latest track \u2018Something Stupid\u2019 featuring AWA kicked off the year in style, holding no bars and providing joy for fans across the world.

That he did throughout the \u201970s, becoming a fixture in the Village folk and rock scenes and getting tabbed as the next big thing to come out of that long-thriving artistic community. Writing in The New York Times, the great rock critic Robert Palmer called him \u201cone of the most gifted singer-songwriters to emerge from the New York scene in years.\u201d He made his recording debut in 1980 with his acclaimed self-titled LP on Arista Records, following it a year later with Golden Down. He also opened the Who\u2019s North American tour at the personal request of the band. In 1982, he signed to Geffen Records but got caught in record-biz limbo and didn\u2019t manage to release another record until 1991, when Columbia issued Places I Have Never Been. With the EP Hard Times in America in 1992, which became a cult favorite throughout Europe, Nile finally managed to jump off the major-label hamster wheel. Gathering together his resources over time, he managed to put out his first self-released album, Beautiful Wreck of the World in 1999. In 2006, Nile released Streets of New York, which some consider to be his best work to date, due to quality production and clever songwriting.

Rightly so, Mike receives regular support and features from: Above & Beyong, Armin Van Buuren, Andy Moor, Solarstone, BT, Ferry Corsten, Gareth Emery, Lange, Markus Schulz, Paul Van Dyk, and Paul Oakenfold to name a few.

This year Mike will continue to push his sound across the Anjunabeats label and Family.

Outside of New York City, Mike has played in various cities of the United States including San Francisco, Miami, Kanas City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington D.C.

Their sound fuses the soul and bitterness of traditional Bachata with modern production.\nThey formed in 2015 as a group of local New Yorkers who simply wanted to bond over their love of Bachata. Over time they started to record songs of their own and decided to share them with the world.\nIn 2018, they released Dime Si Volver\u00e1s, their first collaboration with Dominican Producer Neutro Evans, implementing Dub-step inspired synth sounds and pulsating kick drums. This kicked off a series of performances all around New York City, at local festivals and in residencies at local bars and clubs.\nIn 2019, they continued this partnership to then create Trap-inspired Bachata in Mi Peor Castigo. That summer, Grupo Aurora performed in the Puerto Rican Festival in Bristol, PA in addition to the monthly residency at Harlem Nights and then a Weekly Residency at Verlaine.\nIn 2020, Grupo Aurora had grown a big following in New York City because of their energetic performances but the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to it. So they released Te Alejas de M\u00ed and D\u00f3nde Estar\u00e1s featuring Jack Marcin Wisniewski, as a thank you to their supporters, the latter of which has gone on to be Grupo Aurora's most successful track to date.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

He didnt take the show to the stage until he formed a 2 man rap group in 2004 (T.S.F.P.) along side long time homie Asshole Don, the two released some of the most shocking music to this day, getting much attention in the underground music circuit. The first concert they performed was in Freedom, NY at an underground Punk Rock music festival outdoors. TSFP played the next few years around night clubs and dives in Buffalo, getting mostly Tuesday and Wednesday night bookings starting at 11pm or later. The ability to draw small crowds of 50-100 people consistently on weeknights opened more doors of opportunity and led to better gigs, being offered weekend shows. In 2007 Personal issues led Asshole Don to depart from the group leaving Flatline to return to a solo career in music as he broadened and experimented with his sound, producing and mastering his craft over the next several years. In 2007 Flatline took 2nd place at Battle of the Bands held at Showplace Theater being the only rap act on the entire bill. In 2009 Flatline played nearly every weekend in WNY, playing 46 shows in 52 weeks, some back to back nights playing Buffalo Friday then Niagara Falls or Rochester the following night. Mid year he signed a 15 show booking contract with DTD Entertainment which then led to a meeting with ATA Management. Flatline signed a one year contract with ATA in September of 2009. The contract prohibited Flatline from continuing to book and perform shows which were not presented by the firm beyond his already booked schedule. The contract and agreement sat stagnant as did Flatlines career as he waited for bookings and record negotiations that never came. In 2010 Flatline brought together a super show to the local music scene called The Spook Show which would be held for the next year into 2011 the last Thursday of every month at Club Diablo in Downtown Buffalo, NY. The show held a wide variety of entertainment from live music, horror films, magic, comedy, burlesque, and even hardcore wrestling. Flatline still being under contract prevented him from booking his own concerts to play Live music, so Flatline found a loop hole as he Hosted the Spook Show and was strictly involved in the nightly BarFight / DeathMatches which were a part of the show experience. August 2010 Flatline formed Kamp Crystal Lake when he was asked to collaborate by new coming rapper who Flatline had booked on 2 previous Spook Shows. As he waited for his contract to expire with ATA, he set the plans in motion to make a huge impact returning to the stage and he did just that. The first concert Flatline would return was an event he put together for the upcoming release of \"Rotten Flesh\" Mind Possessing Instrumentals album. It was a Zombie Walk / After Party that took place in downtown Buffalo for his Birthday celebrating the end of his contractual ties and his return to the stage. He split his set performing track for track back and forth as the newly formed Kamp Crystal Lake. Flatline started booking the band and landed a few dates on Hopsin's I Am Raw Tour in spring of 2011. KCL would then go on to release an album on Friday the 13th of May, 2011 and spend the next few years playing dives to top concert halls opening for many tours that came to Buffalo. On Halloween Night, 2011 Flatline launched a concept which would then lead to the beginning of Reel Horror Records a label which he would help give some other local 716 acts a platform to gain exposure and release music to a wider spread audience. Summer of 2013 KCL took home an award from the WNY Music Awards for Rap act \"Performance of the Year\". On September 13th, 2013 Flatline resurrected the Spook Show in Downtown Buffalo, NY at the newly opened Waiting Room. The show was a 7 hour jam packed variety show event keeping true to the original Thursday Night Spook Show which he held years earlier at Club Diablo. The show drew hundreds of local fans as they lined up before doors would open and stayed till wee hours of the night to witness this truly amazing event for the local scene. The night also dated the release of the 2nd full length album release from KCL, which was released for free to the public via KampCrystalLake.com Aside from the music, Flatline has written and self published a comic book, directed multiple music videos and short films, acted in movie roles for Troma, and JFR Productions, is a published poet, DJ, Radio Host of The Eulogy on Think Twice Radio, Graphic Designer, and is also a Professional Wrestler, getting his start in 1996 on the underground circuit then training in Toronto, Canada and touring the Northeast in the early to mid 2000's.

Every mystical journey eventually comes to a fork in the road. The seeker of life\u2019s destiny has two options: remain satisfied with whatever level of consciousness he has already attained, or push forward into ever-new domains of promise and possibility. 2014 sees dance music\u2019s best-known spiritual pilgrims, the Visionquest trio of Ryan Crosson, Lee Curtiss, and Shaun Reeves, bravely embarking upon that wondrous journey. Each member of this celebrated DJing and production team contributes a distinct yet interlocking vision that together forms a seamless, organic whole. Just think of Crosson\u2019s enthusiastic shuffle, Lee\u2019s soulful stare, Shaun\u2019s soft touch. Everything they craft has the same unmistakable flair: slow-burning, shape-shifting, expansive techno and house marked by compositional elegance and unabashed pop hooks. Although long-time partner and co-conspirator Seth Troxler has stepped aside to pursue other projects, 2013 was the biggest year ever for the four. Inspired by the passing of the Mayan calendar, the group embarked upon Visionquest 13, 13 dates where the boys not only played together the whole night, but curated a true multimedia experience. From London to Buenos Aires, from the American hinterland to the Chilean wilderness, Visionquest 13 was a Freudian trip into the deepest recesses of the Detroit rave unconscious, what Ibiza Voice described as a \u201ccollective expedition into the depths of your soul\u201d\u2014but with a sophisticated, modern twist. Their accomplishments are well-known and too many to list. For starters: a critically acclaimed 2011 Fabric mix; year-defining hit remixes for artists as diverse as Kiki, Wareika, Tracey Thorn, and David Lynch; showcases and dates in the biggest clubs and festivals around the world; and the creation of a now iconic-label that\u2019s played host to dancefloor weaponry from the likes of Benoit & Sergio, Life & Death, Dinky, and Laura Jones\u2014all this while each member maintained significant individual production and DJ careers. But, by definition, no journey dwells in the past. So in 2014 they launched Visionquest Special Editions, a limited-release, vinyl only label. Evoking the experimental sounds of the European techno avant-garde that first inspired the boys back in Detroit, the debut release, remixes of Montreal songwriter Quilla, features a stunning collaboration between Shaun and long-time hero Ricardo Villalobos. With Visionquest Special Editions we see the group at home at a breezy, gentle afterparty, not just igniting the club. As Visionquest winds around the corner into their bright future, they remain open and excited for what lies ahead.

Self-taught and trained by the New Jersey bar scene, Tobin owes much of his high-energy performances to his time spent busking on the streets of Galway, Ireland throughout 2015 and 2017. In 2017, Tobin graduated college with a degree in writing. Having expected to become a novelist, his business as a musician began to overshadow his prose. Uncertain of his future, Tobin walked El Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trail through Spain, with his guitar tied to his pack. Upon the trail's completion, the future became obvious. Sean returned to New Jersey in the fall of 2017 where he worked a 9-5 job to fund his music. He released his first album, This Midnight, in 2018. The next year he played Frank Turner's Lost Evenings III in Boston, MA. Later in 2019, Sean released Dreams & Black Caffeine, a four-song EP recorded with his band, The Boardwalk Fire. The group played several shows promoting the EP and planned a tour for 2020, but were forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Instead, Sean and the guys got to work on new music from remote locations. Sean's 2020 LP, East Coast Artifacts, is a compilation of quarantine singles, Dreams & Black Caffeine, and three other tracks. A reflection of life on the shore and dreams of going beyond, ECA is the quintessential work of an independent folk rocker.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2430 FDR Drive, New York, NY 10010", "Artist": "Mitch Oliver ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10408784.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353579, -73.9739209], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Skyport Marina", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022322386-mitch-oliver-at-skyport-marina?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Sunday August 8th, Palosanto and Deep Root Tribe are thrilled to invite you on a boat!\nReally excited to welcome ELLA ROMAND and MITCH OLIVER for our fourth edition of the boat series.\nELLA ROMAND\nMITCH OLIVER\nAQUARIOX\nSKY SO YOUNG\nSUNSET ON THE BOAT\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 8th\n6PM - 10PM (Boarding 5:30PM)\nDRESS CODE: BOHO CHIC + GOOD VIBES\nExpect a comfortable and safe sail through the downtown harbor, by the Brooklyn Bridge, The Statue of Liberty, and the beautiful New York City Skyline on this spacious heated vessel with your closest tribe.

I was having my first case of writers block around the time Don steeped into my life. \u201cHey kid, how\u2019s the music? Are you writing?!?\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering how it felt to have Don Was checking in on your progress, just know it was life changing. I got back to writing and never stopped! Don was on tour with Bob Weir and Wolf Bros when he mentioned a day off that might be a good time to jump in the studio and track new songs. \u201cJust bring in 9 songs. We\u2019ll play them through and then hit record!\u201d. The idea was to capture the essence of my voice, the story, and my songwriting without adding or subtracting. We recorded live, in the same room. Everything as is. One take. I added harmony and a few pieces of percussion at TRI Studios and The Groove Room with our engineer, Vadim Canby, who also mixed and produced the tracks with an emphasis on keeping the production to the bare minimum. Bringing these songs to life with two of my favorite musicians was an astoundingly beautiful experience and this EP (for me) is just that.

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes. This is part of doing that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "21 year celebration of BTBAM.

The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.\u201d \u2018Forever Just Beyond,\u2019 Barzelay\u2019s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett\u2019s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay\u2019s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery. \u201cI look up to Eef with total respect and admiration,\u201d says Avett, \u201cand I hope to survive like he survives: with total love for the new and the unknown. Eef\u2019s a crooner and an indie darling by sound and a mystic sage by depth. That\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Named for a William S. Borroughs character, Clem Snide first emerged from Boston as a three-piece in the early 1990\u2019s, and the group would go on to become a cult and critical favorite, picking up high profile fans from Bon Iver to Ben Folds over the course of three decades and more than a dozen studio albums. NPR highlighted the Israeli-born Barzelay as \u201cthe most underrated songwriter in the business today, with a sneakily firm grasp on poignancy and humor,\u201d while Rolling Stone hailed his songwriting as \u201csoulful and incisive,\u201d and The New Yorker praised his music\u2019s \u201csoothing melodies and candid wit.\u201d Barzelay currently resides in Nashville, TN.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2000 Lowther Dr, Eatontown, NJ 07724", "Artist": "Joe Grushecky ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7727899.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.3018142, -74.0728798], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Roll, Rock", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Suneagles Golf Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022114672-joe-grushecky-at-suneagles-golf-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Joe Grushecky\u2019s music has stood the test of time.

Formed in the mid 1990s, the band soon became a highly acclaimed musical force on the East Coast underground Jazz and Jam Band scene. This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend.

Their first album, The Other Side, finds the duo exploring themes of love, change and loss in a stripped down, predominantly acoustic setting. However, Plane Station is not averse to the grandiose and often stretch their acoustic sound into soaring harmonies and swelling instrumentation. This is evident not only in their sprawling live shows, which often feature drummer and producer Jesse Melito, but their two latest singles, Alcohol and Francis.

Their new creation, \u201dRecurrence\u201d, is a concept album focusing on the cyclic nature of humanity, while highlighting both the technical- and melodic aspects familliar to the progressive metal genre. With \u201dRecurrence\u201d the band focused on making an album that would be more than just the sum of it\u2019s tracks, and therefore envisioned an album where the songs would float into each other, and at the very end connect with the beginning of the first song, making an \u201dinfinite\u201d album; thus mirroring the lyrics. The major theme of the album, lyrically, more or less presented itself; the cyclic nature of humanity. Within that theme the lyrics explore and challenge topics like dementia, whether the world might be a better place without what humanity has become, and what is left behind when we\u2019re gone. As always the band wanted to challenge themselves technically, always trying do better than the last time. But always keeping the songs and the album as a whole in focus. The result is an album comprising six tracks, varying in length from 5 to 22 minutes per track, at times, but certainly not always; in the tradition of bands like Circus Maximus, Threshold, Arena, Haken, early Dream Theater and Pagan\u2019s Mind. Vicinity started the recording of \u201dRecurrence\u201d in november 2015, at Skarp Studio (Keep of Kalessin, Triosphere, Tellus Requiem), where they tracked the drums. The following months would be spent recording bass, guitars and keyboards at Vicinity\u2019s own recording facilites, once again selfproducing the album. Alexander K. Lykke would then record the vocals at Tagline\u2019s recording facilities in Trondheim. Mixing duties was handed to Christer-Andr\u00e9 Cederberg, who had previously mixed both Circus Maximus and Anathema, aiming for- and ending up with a more organic sounding mix than was the case with \u201dAwakening\u201d. Mastering was once again handled by Jens Bogren (Symphony X, James Labrie, Opeth, Haken, Headspace and many more). Vicinity is the musical melting pot of band members Alexander K. Lykke (vocals), Kim-Marius H. Olsen (guitars), Pierre-Nicolai H. Schmidt-Melbye (bass) and Ivar A. Nyland (keyboards). The band draws inspiration from all the kinds of music the band members enjoy listening to, be it classic- or modern prog, rock, pop, classical music, heavy metal or more extreme stuff. Once the musical ideas have been filtered through the band it all comes out sonding like Vicinity anyways, no matter who came up with the inital idea.

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes.

He\u2019s played and recorded with iconic artists in a diversity of genres, from Lady Gaga and the Roots to James Taylor and Chris Botti, but he\u2019s known primarily for his artistry and dexterity as a trumpet player. He\u2019s also a singer, pianist, violinist, guitarist, and producer, with a career history that includes performances at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, Bowery Ballroom, and The Apollo Theater. Andrew\u2019s remarkable range and flexibility is paired with a candor and vulnerability that makes his sound unique. After a successful career contributing to various GRAMMY-nominated albums and performing extensively with beloved groups (including NYC local favorite Jesus On The Mainline and Nees and Vos with Chris Vos of The Record Company), he\u2019s launching his solo career as Andrew Paul, releasing a series of captivating, pared-down tracks that feel both raw and classic at the same time. The new project highlights Andrew\u2019s ability to build emotionally stirring and distinct music with little beyond his voice and his guitar. \u201cWhat I care most about is creating something great. We\u2019re constantly trying to become better versions of ourselves, but that doesn\u2019t mean the skin we\u2019re in is any less perfect or less worthy. One of my goals with this project is to strike a balance between making something perfect and making something real.\u201d Born in Milwaukee, Andrew Paul was raised in a musical family: His father played tuba in a world-famous brass ensemble and his mother was a music teacher. Aware of both the highs and lows of musician life from a young age, Andrew took up the violin at age four, before discovering a deep love for the trumpet at Interlochen Arts Camp one summer. Among the Northern Michigan trees, mentored by some of the most brilliant musicians in the country, he developed an abiding interest in jazz, returning to Interlochen the next eight summers for intense musical study. At the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Andrew earned a degree in Trumpet Performance, touring, performing, writing, and arranging for the school\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated jazz ensemble. \u201cEau Claire is where I really became a musician, playing gigs in the Twin Cities five nights a week. That environment really shaped me as a professional and as an artist.\u201d In the early 2000s, Andrew moved to New York and earned a Jazz Composition degree at the Manhattan School of Music. As Jazz Coordinator for the school after graduation, he formed a tight-knit community with local musicians that led to many future collaborations. For the next decade, Andrew collaborated with a wide spectrum of artists on unique, award-winning projects. He wrote and recorded two albums with drummer David Whitman: Oh, Clara!, which won the 2017 Independent Music Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, and Oh, Hugo! in 2021. He composed, arranged, and toured with the GRAMMY-nominated Bobby Sanabria Multiverse Big Band. He arranged and produced Augie Haas\u2019s Have We Met? and Dream A Little Dream for Playtime Music. And he led NYC-based jam ensemble Jesus On The Mainline, earning a cult following for their \u201cwonderfully raucous, gospel-tinged noise\u201d (according to John Schaefer of WNYC). The group gained popularity until members left to start their own projects. \u201cEventually you realize it\u2019s complicated to take 20 people on the road.\u201d Andrew spent much of 2020\u2019s pandemic honing his guitar skills and developing a new solo creative vision: to write and release a series of stripped-down, rock-and-roll songs as Andrew Paul. \u201cI wanted to be able to perform and tour on my own, and quarantine offered a bittersweet chance to reinvest in myself.\u201d Writing primarily on guitar for the first time, Andrew Paul songs are driven by dynamic melodic lines, vacillating in style between heartland soul, indie rock, and good, old-fashioned rock-and-roll, with a bit of groove (\u00e0 la Budos Band) thrown in the mix. Led by his characteristically natural, earthy vocals, the lyrics tend to cover personal experience: love songs for his partner, stories about his family and friends. The result is a casual but compelling style that feels both idiosyncratic and profound. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. It\u2019s a little jammy, a little loud. It\u2019s very much a portrait of where I am today as a musician and as a human\u2026warts and all. There\u2019s something really powerful about giving in to your passion, regardless of perfection: to celebrate not only the stuff you\u2019re most proud of, but what moves you.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Dean DelRay ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6320438.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-09", "EventDate": "Aug. 9th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022613098-dean-delray-at-the-stand-(main-room)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Take one of the rock star comics of old, drop 'em in today's cluttered world of over-sharing and passive aggressive glad handing, then watch the sparks fly.

Coming from a musical household, Isaiah was introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 4, he found an interest in guitar and immediately asked his parents to purchase one. Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams. At the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson. Shortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others. At the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him. In 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project. Since then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others. Currently he is touring as a guitarist for John Mayer's2017The Search For Everything World Tour. Now, Sharkey is poised to finally take center stage as he fuses together his background in gospel, Jazz, R&B, Blues, Rock, and Funk to create an original sound with an unmistakable dose of soul.", "otherInfo": "Seating is First Come, First ServedFull Bar & Full Dinner Menu AvailableNo refunds or exchanges.
