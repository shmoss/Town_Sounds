Their sound fuses the soul and bitterness of traditional Bachata with modern production.\nThey formed in 2015 as a group of local New Yorkers who simply wanted to bond over their love of Bachata. Over time they started to record songs of their own and decided to share them with the world.\nIn 2018, they released Dime Si Volver\u00e1s, their first collaboration with Dominican Producer Neutro Evans, implementing Dub-step inspired synth sounds and pulsating kick drums. This kicked off a series of performances all around New York City, at local festivals and in residencies at local bars and clubs.\nIn 2019, they continued this partnership to then create Trap-inspired Bachata in Mi Peor Castigo. That summer, Grupo Aurora performed in the Puerto Rican Festival in Bristol, PA in addition to the monthly residency at Harlem Nights and then a Weekly Residency at Verlaine.\nIn 2020, Grupo Aurora had grown a big following in New York City because of their energetic performances but the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to it. So they released Te Alejas de M\u00ed and D\u00f3nde Estar\u00e1s featuring Jack Marcin Wisniewski, as a thank you to their supporters, the latter of which has gone on to be Grupo Aurora's most successful track to date. Grupo Aurora describes their identity and creative goal as \"Amargue Moderno\", aiming to elevate Bachata to new heights.\nLinks\nOfficial Website: www.grupoauroramusic.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/grupo-aurora-merch\nContact: https://www.grupoauroramusic.com/contact"}, {"Address": "74 Wythe Ave, Kings County, NY 11249", "Artist": "Qrion ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11271562.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223189, -73.9578208], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Ambient, House, Deep House, Progressive House", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Gabriel & Dresden + Friends", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102796608-qrion-at-superior-ingredients?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Born and raised in the snowy city of Sapporo, Qrion takes inspiration from all the environments at her whim with a signature sound that oozes genuine artistry.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

He didnt take the show to the stage until he formed a 2 man rap group in 2004 (T.S.F.P.) along side long time homie Asshole Don, the two released some of the most shocking music to this day, getting much attention in the underground music circuit. The first concert they performed was in Freedom, NY at an underground Punk Rock music festival outdoors. TSFP played the next few years around night clubs and dives in Buffalo, getting mostly Tuesday and Wednesday night bookings starting at 11pm or later. The ability to draw small crowds of 50-100 people consistently on weeknights opened more doors of opportunity and led to better gigs, being offered weekend shows. In 2007 Personal issues led Asshole Don to depart from the group leaving Flatline to return to a solo career in music as he broadened and experimented with his sound, producing and mastering his craft over the next several years. In 2007 Flatline took 2nd place at Battle of the Bands held at Showplace Theater being the only rap act on the entire bill. In 2009 Flatline played nearly every weekend in WNY, playing 46 shows in 52 weeks, some back to back nights playing Buffalo Friday then Niagara Falls or Rochester the following night. Mid year he signed a 15 show booking contract with DTD Entertainment which then led to a meeting with ATA Management. Flatline signed a one year contract with ATA in September of 2009. The contract prohibited Flatline from continuing to book and perform shows which were not presented by the firm beyond his already booked schedule. The contract and agreement sat stagnant as did Flatlines career as he waited for bookings and record negotiations that never came. In 2010 Flatline brought together a super show to the local music scene called The Spook Show which would be held for the next year into 2011 the last Thursday of every month at Club Diablo in Downtown Buffalo, NY. The show held a wide variety of entertainment from live music, horror films, magic, comedy, burlesque, and even hardcore wrestling. Flatline still being under contract prevented him from booking his own concerts to play Live music, so Flatline found a loop hole as he Hosted the Spook Show and was strictly involved in the nightly BarFight / DeathMatches which were a part of the show experience. August 2010 Flatline formed Kamp Crystal Lake when he was asked to collaborate by new coming rapper who Flatline had booked on 2 previous Spook Shows. As he waited for his contract to expire with ATA, he set the plans in motion to make a huge impact returning to the stage and he did just that. The first concert Flatline would return was an event he put together for the upcoming release of \"Rotten Flesh\" Mind Possessing Instrumentals album. It was a Zombie Walk / After Party that took place in downtown Buffalo for his Birthday celebrating the end of his contractual ties and his return to the stage. He split his set performing track for track back and forth as the newly formed Kamp Crystal Lake. Flatline started booking the band and landed a few dates on Hopsin's I Am Raw Tour in spring of 2011. KCL would then go on to release an album on Friday the 13th of May, 2011 and spend the next few years playing dives to top concert halls opening for many tours that came to Buffalo. On Halloween Night, 2011 Flatline launched a concept which would then lead to the beginning of Reel Horror Records a label which he would help give some other local 716 acts a platform to gain exposure and release music to a wider spread audience. Summer of 2013 KCL took home an award from the WNY Music Awards for Rap act \"Performance of the Year\". On September 13th, 2013 Flatline resurrected the Spook Show in Downtown Buffalo, NY at the newly opened Waiting Room. The show was a 7 hour jam packed variety show event keeping true to the original Thursday Night Spook Show which he held years earlier at Club Diablo. The show drew hundreds of local fans as they lined up before doors would open and stayed till wee hours of the night to witness this truly amazing event for the local scene. The night also dated the release of the 2nd full length album release from KCL, which was released for free to the public via KampCrystalLake.com Aside from the music, Flatline has written and self published a comic book, directed multiple music videos and short films, acted in movie roles for Troma, and JFR Productions, is a published poet, DJ, Radio Host of The Eulogy on Think Twice Radio, Graphic Designer, and is also a Professional Wrestler, getting his start in 1996 on the underground circuit then training in Toronto, Canada and touring the Northeast in the early to mid 2000's.

Inspired by the passing of the Mayan calendar, the group embarked upon Visionquest 13, 13 dates where the boys not only played together the whole night, but curated a true multimedia experience. From London to Buenos Aires, from the American hinterland to the Chilean wilderness, Visionquest 13 was a Freudian trip into the deepest recesses of the Detroit rave unconscious, what Ibiza Voice described as a \u201ccollective expedition into the depths of your soul\u201d\u2014but with a sophisticated, modern twist. Their accomplishments are well-known and too many to list. For starters: a critically acclaimed 2011 Fabric mix; year-defining hit remixes for artists as diverse as Kiki, Wareika, Tracey Thorn, and David Lynch; showcases and dates in the biggest clubs and festivals around the world; and the creation of a now iconic-label that\u2019s played host to dancefloor weaponry from the likes of Benoit & Sergio, Life & Death, Dinky, and Laura Jones\u2014all this while each member maintained significant individual production and DJ careers. But, by definition, no journey dwells in the past. So in 2014 they launched Visionquest Special Editions, a limited-release, vinyl only label. Evoking the experimental sounds of the European techno avant-garde that first inspired the boys back in Detroit, the debut release, remixes of Montreal songwriter Quilla, features a stunning collaboration between Shaun and long-time hero Ricardo Villalobos. With Visionquest Special Editions we see the group at home at a breezy, gentle afterparty, not just igniting the club. As Visionquest winds around the corner into their bright future, they remain open and excited for what lies ahead.

Self-taught and trained by the New Jersey bar scene, Tobin owes much of his high-energy performances to his time spent busking on the streets of Galway, Ireland throughout 2015 and 2017. In 2017, Tobin graduated college with a degree in writing. Having expected to become a novelist, his business as a musician began to overshadow his prose. Uncertain of his future, Tobin walked El Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trail through Spain, with his guitar tied to his pack. Upon the trail's completion, the future became obvious. Sean returned to New Jersey in the fall of 2017 where he worked a 9-5 job to fund his music. He released his first album, This Midnight, in 2018. The next year he played Frank Turner's Lost Evenings III in Boston, MA. Later in 2019, Sean released Dreams & Black Caffeine, a four-song EP recorded with his band, The Boardwalk Fire. The group played several shows promoting the EP and planned a tour for 2020, but were forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Instead, Sean and the guys got to work on new music from remote locations. Sean's 2020 LP, East Coast Artifacts, is a compilation of quarantine singles, Dreams & Black Caffeine, and three other tracks. A reflection of life on the shore and dreams of going beyond, ECA is the quintessential work of an independent folk rocker.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "5th & Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Sensational Soul Cruisers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9264373.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.748189, -95.97160199999999], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "R&b, Early R&b, Soul, Motown, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Wonder Bar", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022475458-sensational-soul-cruisers-at-wonder-bar?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "21 AND OVER GA EVENT DOORS 6:30 PM LIMITED RESERVED FULL TABLES AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE"}, {"Address": "19 Mountain Ave., Mendham, NJ 07945", "Artist": "Kimon & the Prophets ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11156704.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7787922, -74.60319799999999], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Funk, Reggae, Rock, Jam Rock, Blues", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Mendham Summer Concert Series", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102521148-kimon-and-the-prophets-at-borough-park-gazebo?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Whether raising eyebrows with superbly crafted original songs, exploding the hits of Stevie Wonder or Sting into ultimate groove tunes, or funkin\u2019 up a Stevie Ray Vaughn blues jam, anything is possible with the Prophets' vast library of songs.

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes. This is part of doing that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "21 year celebration of BTBAM.

I was having my first case of writers block around the time Don steeped into my life. \u201cHey kid, how\u2019s the music? Are you writing?!?\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering how it felt to have Don Was checking in on your progress, just know it was life changing. I got back to writing and never stopped! Don was on tour with Bob Weir and Wolf Bros when he mentioned a day off that might be a good time to jump in the studio and track new songs. \u201cJust bring in 9 songs. We\u2019ll play them through and then hit record!\u201d. The idea was to capture the essence of my voice, the story, and my songwriting without adding or subtracting. We recorded live, in the same room. Everything as is. One take. I added harmony and a few pieces of percussion at TRI Studios and The Groove Room with our engineer, Vadim Canby, who also mixed and produced the tracks with an emphasis on keeping the production to the bare minimum.

The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.\u201d \u2018Forever Just Beyond,\u2019 Barzelay\u2019s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett\u2019s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay\u2019s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery. \u201cI look up to Eef with total respect and admiration,\u201d says Avett, \u201cand I hope to survive like he survives: with total love for the new and the unknown. Eef\u2019s a crooner and an indie darling by sound and a mystic sage by depth. That\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Named for a William S. Borroughs character, Clem Snide first emerged from Boston as a three-piece in the early 1990\u2019s, and the group would go on to become a cult and critical favorite, picking up high profile fans from Bon Iver to Ben Folds over the course of three decades and more than a dozen studio albums.

However, Plane Station is not averse to the grandiose and often stretch their acoustic sound into soaring harmonies and swelling instrumentation.

This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Their new creation, \u201dRecurrence\u201d, is a concept album focusing on the cyclic nature of humanity, while highlighting both the technical- and melodic aspects familliar to the progressive metal genre. With \u201dRecurrence\u201d the band focused on making an album that would be more than just the sum of it\u2019s tracks, and therefore envisioned an album where the songs would float into each other, and at the very end connect with the beginning of the first song, making an \u201dinfinite\u201d album; thus mirroring the lyrics. The major theme of the album, lyrically, more or less presented itself; the cyclic nature of humanity. Within that theme the lyrics explore and challenge topics like dementia, whether the world might be a better place without what humanity has become, and what is left behind when we\u2019re gone. As always the band wanted to challenge themselves technically, always trying do better than the last time. But always keeping the songs and the album as a whole in focus. The result is an album comprising six tracks, varying in length from 5 to 22 minutes per track, at times, but certainly not always; in the tradition of bands like Circus Maximus, Threshold, Arena, Haken, early Dream Theater and Pagan\u2019s Mind. Vicinity started the recording of \u201dRecurrence\u201d in november 2015, at Skarp Studio (Keep of Kalessin, Triosphere, Tellus Requiem), where they tracked the drums. The following months would be spent recording bass, guitars and keyboards at Vicinity\u2019s own recording facilites, once again selfproducing the album. Alexander K. Lykke would then record the vocals at Tagline\u2019s recording facilities in Trondheim. Mixing duties was handed to Christer-Andr\u00e9 Cederberg, who had previously mixed both Circus Maximus and Anathema, aiming for- and ending up with a more organic sounding mix than was the case with \u201dAwakening\u201d. Mastering was once again handled by Jens Bogren (Symphony X, James Labrie, Opeth, Haken, Headspace and many more). Vicinity is the musical melting pot of band members Alexander K. Lykke (vocals), Kim-Marius H. Olsen (guitars), Pierre-Nicolai H. Schmidt-Melbye (bass) and Ivar A. Nyland (keyboards).

Could you consume the innermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about an attention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer? Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolina quintet explore these themes by personally smashing boundaries once again. Automata marks the band\u2019s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition of progression in the process. \u201cWe never want to repeat ourselves,\u201d affirms Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to do something different, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places, while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that\u2019s fun and challenging. We never know how it\u2019s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We\u2019ve never written an entire piece and presented it in separate parts like this.\u201d This approach cemented the group as progressive music\u2019s most unpredictable outlier since its formation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007\u2019s watershed Colors followed by The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later. 2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim from Noisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rare perfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runs with the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. \u201cLyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at the end,\u201d continues Tommy. \u201cFor as deep and dark as it is, there\u2019s a positive outcome, which we\u2019ve never had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainment broadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within that dream. The character thinks it\u2019s all real.\u201d \u201cEven though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,\u201d adds Paul. \u201cOftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forget that they\u2019re real people with problems and issues. They\u2019re society\u2019s escape from reality as we use them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula of what a progressive metal band can do,\u201d states Dan. \u201cThere are all these little moments where we\u2019ve done something we never did before. \u2018Millions\u2019 is the perfect example. It\u2019s four-minutes of straight melody\u2014another first.\u201d With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The Buried And Me realize their potential to its fullest\u2014and go one step further. \u201cAll of our music should build up to the newest record,\u201d Tommy leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. It sounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it\u2019s still new. We hope to keep the music industry on its toes.

He\u2019s played and recorded with iconic artists in a diversity of genres, from Lady Gaga and the Roots to James Taylor and Chris Botti, but he\u2019s known primarily for his artistry and dexterity as a trumpet player. He\u2019s also a singer, pianist, violinist, guitarist, and producer, with a career history that includes performances at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, Bowery Ballroom, and The Apollo Theater. Andrew\u2019s remarkable range and flexibility is paired with a candor and vulnerability that makes his sound unique. After a successful career contributing to various GRAMMY-nominated albums and performing extensively with beloved groups (including NYC local favorite Jesus On The Mainline and Nees and Vos with Chris Vos of The Record Company), he\u2019s launching his solo career as Andrew Paul, releasing a series of captivating, pared-down tracks that feel both raw and classic at the same time. The new project highlights Andrew\u2019s ability to build emotionally stirring and distinct music with little beyond his voice and his guitar. \u201cWhat I care most about is creating something great. We\u2019re constantly trying to become better versions of ourselves, but that doesn\u2019t mean the skin we\u2019re in is any less perfect or less worthy. One of my goals with this project is to strike a balance between making something perfect and making something real.\u201d Born in Milwaukee, Andrew Paul was raised in a musical family: His father played tuba in a world-famous brass ensemble and his mother was a music teacher. Aware of both the highs and lows of musician life from a young age, Andrew took up the violin at age four, before discovering a deep love for the trumpet at Interlochen Arts Camp one summer. Among the Northern Michigan trees, mentored by some of the most brilliant musicians in the country, he developed an abiding interest in jazz, returning to Interlochen the next eight summers for intense musical study. At the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Andrew earned a degree in Trumpet Performance, touring, performing, writing, and arranging for the school\u2019s GRAMMY-nominated jazz ensemble. \u201cEau Claire is where I really became a musician, playing gigs in the Twin Cities five nights a week. That environment really shaped me as a professional and as an artist.\u201d In the early 2000s, Andrew moved to New York and earned a Jazz Composition degree at the Manhattan School of Music. As Jazz Coordinator for the school after graduation, he formed a tight-knit community with local musicians that led to many future collaborations. For the next decade, Andrew collaborated with a wide spectrum of artists on unique, award-winning projects. He wrote and recorded two albums with drummer David Whitman: Oh, Clara!, which won the 2017 Independent Music Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, and Oh, Hugo! in 2021. He composed, arranged, and toured with the GRAMMY-nominated Bobby Sanabria Multiverse Big Band. He arranged and produced Augie Haas\u2019s Have We Met? and Dream A Little Dream for Playtime Music. And he led NYC-based jam ensemble Jesus On The Mainline, earning a cult following for their \u201cwonderfully raucous, gospel-tinged noise\u201d (according to John Schaefer of WNYC). The group gained popularity until members left to start their own projects. \u201cEventually you realize it\u2019s complicated to take 20 people on the road.\u201d Andrew spent much of 2020\u2019s pandemic honing his guitar skills and developing a new solo creative vision: to write and release a series of stripped-down, rock-and-roll songs as Andrew Paul. \u201cI wanted to be able to perform and tour on my own, and quarantine offered a bittersweet chance to reinvest in myself.\u201d Writing primarily on guitar for the first time, Andrew Paul songs are driven by dynamic melodic lines, vacillating in style between heartland soul, indie rock, and good, old-fashioned rock-and-roll, with a bit of groove (\u00e0 la Budos Band) thrown in the mix. Led by his characteristically natural, earthy vocals, the lyrics tend to cover personal experience: love songs for his partner, stories about his family and friends. The result is a casual but compelling style that feels both idiosyncratic and profound. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. It\u2019s a little jammy, a little loud. It\u2019s very much a portrait of where I am today as a musician and as a human\u2026warts and all. There\u2019s something really powerful about giving in to your passion, regardless of perfection: to celebrate not only the stuff you\u2019re most proud of, but what moves you.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Rebounder ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11497906.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7096703, -73.9232787], "Date": "2021-08-09", "EventDate": "Aug. 9th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rebounder with Toledo @ Elsewhere Rooftop", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102735812-rebounder-at-elsewhere-rooftop?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "instagram.com/reboundenyc twitter.com/reboundernyc soundcloud.com/reboundernyc", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Dean DelRay ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6320438.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-09", "EventDate": "Aug. 9th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022613098-dean-delray-at-the-stand-(main-room)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Take one of the rock star comics of old, drop 'em in today's cluttered world of over-sharing and passive aggressive glad handing, then watch the sparks fly.

Dean endured the ups-and-downs of music industry buffoonery before eventually landing onstage in America's toughest and most rewarding comedy clubs. Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"Mohr Stories,\" \"You Made it Weird\" and his own weekly podcast, \"Let There Be Talk,\" on the All Things Comedy network. Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hitmaker for Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys). Dean's comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience. His premises, punchlines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to a near Sam Kinison level of animation. As an actor, Delray can be seen in \"The Longshots\" (starring Ice Cube), \"Hellride\" (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino) and \"Maron\" on IFC.

Coming from a musical household, Isaiah was introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 4, he found an interest in guitar and immediately asked his parents to purchase one. Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams. At the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson. Shortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others. At the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him. In 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project. Since then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others.

From bars to clubs to theaters to major music festivals, from an early age. Jake became a fixture on the rock music scene. Jake\u2019s band shared the stage with acts such as Blink-182, Jack White, BB King, and The Flaming Lips. In 2010, Rolling Stone described him as \u201chaving the ability to harness the musical ferocity of Trey Anastasio, Les Claypool and Stewart Copeland before being able to legally drive a car\u201d. In 2015, McLovins recorded a self-titled LP with Grammy/Tony/Emmy award winning producer, Bill Sherman, who discovered the band on a trip to Hartford, CT. From there the band toured nationally for several years opening for the likes of the Gin Blossoms, an extended run with Flobots, and playing major festivals like Bunbury in Cincinnati with Foster the People, Chainsmokers and Post Malone as well as Summer Camp in Illinois with Tom Petty, the Roots and Lil\u2019 Dickey. Meanwhile on television, Jake left an imprint as a composer and lyricist for Sesame Street writing dozens of songs for artists like Ed Sheeran and Leon Bridges. He also did a stint leading the house band on ESPN2\u2019s Sports-Nation for a season. In 2019, Jake felt the urge to evolve his sound further and enlisted the help of producing wizard Andy Seltzer (Maggie Rodgers, Chelsea Cutler, many more). The result of three days in Los Angeles with Andy marked the debut release of Jake\u2019s solo project. The sound combines his rock n\u2019 roll roots and acumen as a songwriter with Andy\u2019s golden touch as a next-generation producer. \u201cThe Layover\u201d EP was conceived on a journey to The Fonda Theatre for the Strange 80\u2019s 2 benefit concert. After a 31 hour layover, sleep deprived and delusional Jake landed in LA with only hours to spare until load in. He headed to the venue unaware that this night would forever change his musical journey. Greeted by members of Metallica, Eagles of Death Metal and David Hasselhoff, Jake seamlessly blended into the uniquely chaotic affair. The night escalated into a dream like reality from stage to greenroom, to Jake finding himself on a beach early in the morning with a feeling of deep nostalgia that sunk into his heart. It was then that Jake realized that this was his destiny. This feeling sparked an idea, to create new music that was nostalgic, surreal and of course, music that rocked. With years of touring and production experience under his belt and an ability to masterfully handle multiple instruments, Jake has created a sound that pulls deep from his rock roots and reaches far into what can only be described as the sound of the 20\u2019s. On stage, Jake goes from drums to keys to guitar all while communicating to an audience with deeply personal lyrics and stony vocals. Jake has managed to create a sound with the uniqueness of Arcade Fire, the drive of Tom Petty, and the honesty of Death Cab For Cutie. This next chapter for Jake promises to help write the history of the next generation of rock n\u2019 roll.", "otherInfo": "Jake Huffman with Susie McCollum"}, {"Address": "1090 Wyckoff Ave, Queens, NY 11385, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "PULSE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7629159.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.694302, -73.90216570000001], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "Deathcore, Atmospheric Djent", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "H0l0", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022618479-pulse-at-h0l0?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "PULSE wurde im Jahr 2000 von Nemesis, als Soloprojekt, neben der \u00d6sterreichischen Black Metal Band ASTAROTH gegr\u00fcndet.

His singing, yodeling, growling, leering and brash preachin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 is accompanied by sloppy riffs and licks from his '59 Gibson guitar and pounding backbeat brought forth by his amplified left foot. The remainder of this one-man band consists of an unwieldy combination of beat-up amplifiers and old microphones strung together by a tangled mess of guitar cables. Years of non-stop touring have honed his assault to a fine edge; his wide-eyed throw downs in the First Church of Ultimate Fanaticism routinely lead giddy followers to a fiery baptism. Scott H.

The 26-year-old is home in her native Rochester, New York, reflecting on Delivery, her highly anticipated full-length album, as well as the hard journey the classically trained, defiantly original harpist had to travel to become the writer AND performer, she was meant to be.   \u201cA lot of these songs came from feeling stuck and also like people were pulling me in a bunch of different directions,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cI wanted to say, \u2018Just wait for me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Mikaela\u2019s plea for patience\u2013\u2013a little bit sweet, a little bit angry and raw\u2013\u2013fed a fierce 10-song collection. A joyride that pulls from rock, 70s and 80s pop, and funk, Delivery manages to be both daring and comfortable, full of not just risks, but hooks.  Produced by Grammy winner John Congleton (St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, David Byrne, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Delivery is a triumphant next chapter. \u201cJohn tries to find that moment instead of the perfect take,\u201d Mikaela says. \u201cThat made it all sound really special.\u201d Childhood friend Alex Cot\u00e9 (drums, percussion) and Shane McCarthy (bass) play on the record - already close from years of touring. Recently, Mikaela\u2019s ensemble became a family affair with the addition of Shane\u2019s older brother Cian McCarthy on guitar.  Mikaela\u2019s unconventional path to working songwriter began before high school, growing up in Rochester. With plans to join a symphony, she studied harp performance at Crane School of Music, but halfway through, she decided the traditional harpist\u2019s path wasn\u2019t for her. Following graduation, Mikaela moved to Brooklyn, following in the footsteps of artists who\u2019ve come before her. But in the city, she could never quite find her footing. She kept busy, toured, and recorded an album that would eventually be shelved. Feeling confused and alone, she retreated back to Rochester, unsure of her next move.  Then, the last place Mikaela wanted to be saved her. Rochester\u2019s artistic community embraced her, encouraged by bandmates including Alex Cot\u00e9 and the group Joywave, she hit her stride.

It\u2019s in that space, that in-between, where Brooklyn-based indie-folker Skout has taken residence. Skout\u2019s candid lyrics explore the intricacies of navigating this in-between, powerfully depicting the complex relationships between identity, change, and a search for solid ground. Perhaps most unique to Skout, however, is the intricate, percussive acoustic guitar that has come to define her sound. Skout\u2019s innate knack for catchy, eclectic songwriting shines in her 2014 debut EP, Again Anew. After touring to support the EP and securing talented guitarist Connor Gladney as a songwriting and performing counterpart later that year, Skout caught the attention of soul-pop powerhouse Eric Hutchinson. He signed on to produce her second EP, Just Words, released July 1, 2016. Skout's sophomore effort maintains an unshakeable acoustic backbone while simultaneously demonstrating the versatility of her songwriting chops.

Now he is launching a solo project that reimagines Sikh kirtan with boundary-defying Punjabi anthems to uplift & ignite. Sonny's first musical outlet as a child of immigrant parents in North Carolina was singing Sikh devotional music in gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship). His energy shifted to other types of music as he became a more serious musician: ska, reggae, funk, punk rock, bhangra, and more. In 2003, Sonny co-founded the political rock band Outernational and recorded an album produced by Tom Morello. As a singer and trumpet player, he has been central to the sound and raw energy of Red Baraat since the band's inception in 2008, touring globally and recording 5 studio albums. Sonny is currently finishing his debut solo album, produced by Wil-Dog Abers of Ozomatli, entitled Chardi Kala, the Sikh concept of revolutionary eternal optimism. His first single, Mitar Pyare Nu, premiered on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered and Rolling Stone India. Sonny\u2019s music is a reminder that hope, love, and devotion are crucial to our struggles and our collective survival. Chardi Kala is a return to Sonny\u2019s Punjabi & Sikh roots, but with the lens he\u2019s developed over the course of his life as a touring musician, educator, and activist. Musically, the project embodies the many spiritual, political, and aesthetic elements that have shaped Sonny: a bolero-mariachi Sikh shabad on one track, a qawwali song with a reggae bass line on another, a bombastic Ghadar Party tribute in Punjabi and Spanish on yet another. His live band, which includes harmonium, electric guitar, tabla, and drumset, provides listeners with an experience of both introspective reflection and fervent urgency.", "otherInfo": "Sonny Singh's Chardi Kala project LIVE at Rockwood Music Hall Stage 2 in Manhattan. \nDoors - 6pm\nShow - 7pm\n21+ $10 cover\n\nSonny Singh - vocals, trumpet, dhol \nYuka Tadano - bass\nRia Modak - guitar, harmonium, vocals\nJonathan Goldberger - guitar\nRohin Khemani - drums and percussion"}, {"Address": "1200 Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Paperback Writer- The Complete Beatles Experience ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11218768.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.2228108, -73.9991083], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "National Tribute Show", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Paperback Writer LIVE on the Jersey Shore !", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102565758-paperback-writer-the-complete-beatles-experience-at-tim-mcloone's-supper-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Having traveled to 33 countries and over 26 states Paperback Writer -The Beatles Experience can be seen at Disneyland and on board four major cruise lines, theaters and casinos all across the U.S. Hear the hits from the Ed Sullivan Show through the colorful Sgt.

They formed in 2000 in New York, NY. Their name was inspired by an awkward conversation with a U-Haul employee who was inspecting a van that the band had rented. The U-haul employee, attempting to make polite conversation, asked the three bespectacled band members if they were brothers. They said no. He asked if they were scientists. They told him that they were musicians, not scientists. To this day, they regret telling the truth. But the band has denied this and admitted they are in actual fact named after the Cap'n Jazz song which bears the name. The band formed while its members attended the Claremont Colleges. Murray and Cain attended Pomona College; Michael Tapper attended Harvey Mudd College. The band have released three self-made EPs (Bitching!, Safety, Fun, and Learning (In That Order) and In Action) and have released their debut LP, With Love and Squalor on Virgin Records. The first three singles are \"Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt\", \"The Great Escape\" and \"It's a Hit\". The album takes its name from the J.D. Salinger short story \"For Esme - With Love and Squalor\". They have since released another LP Crap Attack, which is a collection of B-Sides, covers and other rarities. The band play the Carling Weekend: Reading and Leeds Festivals in August. In one of their most important television appearances, the band performed on the December 19, 2005 episode of the Late Show with David Letterman on CBS. On the 1st November 2007, NME reported that Michael Tapper has left We Are Scientists under amicable circumstances, and will not join the band for their forthcoming UK University tour. On September 18, 2007, the band announced on their website that Max Hart, a keyboardist and guitarist who has played live with them before, has joined the band temporarily. As they put it: \"There's no easy answer as to how long Max will stick around. Maybe we'll grow to hate his sanctimonious ways, which for now tickle us so. Maybe he'll grow to hate our open-minded, funny, refreshing, handsome ways, thus achieving what psychologists and bookies long ago labeled impossible.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "85 Ave A, New York, NY 10009", "Artist": "Jason Miles ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11006062.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.72525, -73.9844492], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Rebecca Angel Album Debut at Drom NYC with Allstar Band", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102746713-jason-miles-at-drom?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Rebecca Angel Performs songs from her debut album Love,Life Choices accompanying her will be an allstar band of New York\u2019s finest player.\nDiem NYC 8PM"}, {"Address": "4 Pennsylvania Plz, New York, NY 10001", "Artist": "Run The Jewels ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7617835.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7505621, -73.99347089999999], "Date": "2021-08-10", "EventDate": "Aug. 10th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Madison Square Garden", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1020308267-run-the-jewels-at-madison-square-garden?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "In 2012, El-P produced Killer Mike's critically acclaimed album R.A.P.

Coming from a musical household, Isaiah was introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 4, he found an interest in guitar and immediately asked his parents to purchase one. Shortly after, Isaiah started learning music under the close introduction of his father Michael Sharkey. He would learn about different musical genres/styles from gospel music,(which came from growing up in the church) to jazz, R&B, blues, rock and funk music. It wasn't long after that Isaiah would become noticed by other musicians in the Chicago area for being a young new talent. Soon after , he started doing concerts in the church as well as sitting in local jazz club jams. At the age of 14, Isaiah along with his father and brothers released their first album entitled,\"Skyliner\". This album displayed Isaiah's ability to play covers and some transcriptions from greats like Wes Montgomery and George Benson. Shortly thereafter, Isaiah began his recording career as well as being a sideman for musical artists in the gospel genre such as Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong and others. At the age of 18, he began touring with Ronald Isley as his lead guitarist and shortlythereafter he secured the opportunity to record two incredible albums with him. In 2009, Isaiah started working with 4-Time Grammy award winner D'Angelo on his third album (Black Messiah - 2016 Grammy Award Winner for Best R&B Album) which secured Isaiah a 2016 Grammy Award for his work & contribution to the project. Since then, Isaiah has worked, recorded, and toured with numerous world renown & Grammy Award Winning artists such as, Patti Labelle, Christopher Martin (Coldplay), Paul Simon, Corrine Bailey Rae, Mike Posner, Keith Urban, Brian Mcknight, Boyz Il Men, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Jennifer Hudson, Regina Bell, Ruben Studdard, Lupe Fiasco, Kelly Price, Faith Evans, Rance Allen, The Winans, The Clarke Sisters, Chris Dave and the DrumHedz, and many others. Currently he is touring as a guitarist for John Mayer's2017The Search For Everything World Tour.

Dean endured the ups-and-downs of music industry buffoonery before eventually landing onstage in America's toughest and most rewarding comedy clubs. Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"Mohr Stories,\" \"You Made it Weird\" and his own weekly podcast, \"Let There Be Talk,\" on the All Things Comedy network. Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hitmaker for Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys). Dean's comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience. His premises, punchlines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to a near Sam Kinison level of animation. As an actor, Delray can be seen in \"The Longshots\" (starring Ice Cube), \"Hellride\" (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino) and \"Maron\" on IFC.

They have become such musical influences on some of today\u2019s popular artists that the September 2006 cover of Spin Magazine\u2019s headline read: \u201cWhy Hall and Oates are the New Velvet Underground.\u201d Their artistic fan base includes Rob Thomas, John Mayer, Brandon Flowers of the Killers, Ben Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie and MTV\u2019s newest hipsters Gym Class Heroes who dubbed their tour \u201cDaryl Hall for President Tour 2007.\u201d One of the most sampled artists today, their impact can be heard everywhere from boy band harmonies, to neo-soul to rap-rock fusion. Signed to Atlantic by Ahmet Ertegun in the 1970\u2019s, Daryl Hall & John Oates have sold more albums than any other duo in music history. Their 1973 debut album, Abandoned Luncheonette, produced by Arif Mardin, yielded the Top 10 single, \u201cShe\u2019s Gone,\u201d which also went to #1 on the R&B charts when it was covered by Taveras. The duo recorded one more album with Atlantic, War Babies, (produced by Todd Rundgren) before they left and promptly signed to RCA. Their tenure at RCA would catapult the duo to international superstardom. From the mid-\u201970s to the mid-\u201980s, the duo would score six #1 singles, including \u201cRich Girl\u201d (also #1 R&B), \u201cKiss on My List,\u201d \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Go For That (No Can Do) (also #1 R&B), \u201cManeater\u201d and \u201cOut of Touch\u201d from their six consecutive multi-platinum albums\u2014\u201976\u2019s Bigger Than Both of Us, \u201980\u2019s Voices, \u201981\u2019s Private Eyes, \u201882\u2019s H2O, \u201883\u2019s Rock N Soul, Part I and \u201884\u2019s Big Bam Boom.

That same year, Daryl and John, participated in the historic \u201cWe Are the World\u201d session as well as closing the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. By 1987, the R.I.A.A. recognized Daryl Hall and John Oates as the NUMBER-ONE SELLING DUO in music history, a record they still hold today. On May 20, 2008, the duo was honored with the Icon Award during BMI\u2019s 56th annual Pop Awards. The award has previously gone to the Bee Gees, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Paul Simon, Brian Wilson, Willie Nelson, James Brown, Ray Davies, Carlos Santana and Dolly Parton. Daryl Hall\u2019s latest project is a multi-award-winning monthly web series (and TV show), Live from Daryl\u2019s House. \u201cIt was a light bulb moment,\u201d he says of the show\u2019s genesis. \u201cI\u2019ve had this idea about just sitting on the porch or in my living room, playing music with my friends and putting it up on the Internet.\u201d The past episodes of Live From Daryl\u2019s House have featured a mix of well-known performers like Jason Mraz, Joe Walsh, Booker T and the MGs, Blind Boys of Alabama, Rob Thomas, Cheap Trick, Train, Cee Lo Green, Smokey Robinson, The Doors\u2019 Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek, Toots Hibbert, Nick Lowe, K.T.

His earliest exposure to music came at home, thanks to an extended family of musicians and ready access to a wealth of Colombian genres. By the age of 12, Torres was performing with various Bogot\u00e1 ensembles, developing techniques that allowed him to quickly adapt to the demands of jazz, pop music, and salsa. A classically trained percussionist, he earned a degree in Music Composition from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s esteemed Universidad Javeriana. \n\nBefore departing for the U.S. in 1999, the resourceful young artist had become an established figure on Colombia\u2019s fertile music scene, backing leading Colombian performers while serving as an arranger and music director for his country\u2019s highly regarded telenovelas (TV soap operas) and films.\n\nShortly after arriving in the U.S., his career took a dramatic turn when he was tapped by famed trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval to join his group. Torres spent four years touring the world and recording with the jazz great, polishing his ever-expanding talents while attracting the attention of a long list of renowned artists with whom he would eventually collaborate.

His talents have also been featured in concerts with the Boston Pops, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Nashville Symphony and at a host of music festivals around the world.\n\nMore recently Torres was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Classical Album with the production \"Regreso,\" an incredible project done in collaboration with the Nueva Filarmon\u00eda of Bogot\u00e1."}, {"Address": "349 E 13th St, New York, NY 10003", "Artist": "Jamile Staevie Ayres ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9238883.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7309626, -73.98334729999999], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz, Brazilian Music", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Hermana NYC", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102796169-jamile-staevie-ayres-at-hermana-nyc?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Emerging Jazz vocalist Jamile is a recent graduate of the inaugural Master's of Jazz Studies class at City College of New York.

Taking cues from artists like Counting Crows, Tom Petty, and Jason Isbell, he creates his own brand of Americana rock & roll. Hello, my name is Seth Adam. It is unconventional to offer a biography written in the first person. As the clich\u00e9 goes, rules were meant to be broken... I am a 44 year old singer-songwriter born and raised in Connecticut. I reside in the great city of New Haven with my wife and daughter. I\u2019ve been playing music, in one form or another, since I was 5 years old. I got my start playing in front of audiences when I was in the elementary school chorus. Rock & roll got a hold of me just before my teen years, and I performed my first \u201crock & roll band\u201d show at one of those old moose/elk/insert-animal-type halls when I was 14. I've been hooked on the rock & roll ever since. Here's the part where I tell you what I am currently doing with my career. 2016 was a turning point in my career as I wrote and recorded songs out of a hobbled together, home studio space. Playing all of the instruments, engineering, producing, and everything else-ing on my own resulted in an EP called East Rock. The experience inspired me to continue to do much of the same for the foreseeable future, foregoing using the formal recording studios. In January 2018, I released a single (and video) called \u2018Anytown,\u2019 written in response to the events in Charlottesville VA the summer before. Currently, I am writing and recording songs for a full-length album as well as wrapping up an all-acoustic version of my 2007 release, Where You Come From, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the original. On February 14th, 2020, I released a single called \u2018At Different Ends,\u2019 written about a year after the Presidential election of 2016. The song reflects on the division and loss of wonder in American society from the perspective of one lonely observer. Here's the part where I give you some history, drop some names, and tell you about some influences. I describe my music as singer-songwriter/Americana/folk/rock. That\u2019s a lot of sub genres, but probably the best way to characterize it. My earliest influences were Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Kenny Rogers. My dad used to play their records for me when I was a kid. Though the teenage years were my hair-metal, progressive-rock, and grunge phases, I find the music I write now to be the most heartfelt. My biggest influence is Counting Crows with Led Zeppelin coming in at a close second place. In recent years I\u2019ve come to nearly deify The Beatles and Son Volt. Ryan Adams, Jason Isbell, and Wilco have also been tremendous influences on my work. I love making music. It's how I make a living. It takes a lot of work and it pays off. In 2007, my song \u2018Get Out\u2019 was licensed to Volkswagen for their Sights & Sounds campaign. In 2008, then Fox entertainment columnist in NYC, Roger Friedman, called me \u201cthe hardest-working, best live act in indie rock.\u201d In 2010, I received a nice hometown nod from The New Haven Advocate\u2019s reader\u2019s poll, winning the Best Rock Band category. For my 2013 release, \u201cSteel Tempered Pride,\u201d I had the good fortune of working with David Immergl\u00fcck, guitarist for Counting Crows, James Maddock, and Camper Van Beethoven. In 2016 I was nominated for Male Performer of the Year for The New England Music Awards, and again in 2017 for Songwriter Of The Year. Through the years, I\u2019ve opened for Grammy-winning Steep Canyon Rangers, Grammy-winning Robert Cray, Tonic, Vertical Horizon, The Alternate Routes, Will Hoge, Gary Louris (The Jayhawks), Ken and Drew from Sister Hazel, Kyle Cook (Matchbox Twenty), and Mayer Hawthorne. I also like dogs. I think they're cool.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

The group formed in London in 1974. The two main writing partners in the band, Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, are widely considered to be among the finest melodic pop songwriters of their generation and have often been compared with the legendary Lennon-McCartney partnership, although unlike The Beatles, Difford and Tilbrook's direct collaboration on songs continued through most of the group's career. The original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland. Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike & The Mechanics as well as a solo artist. Since the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks. In 2007 Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain. These dates are to support a new Greatest Hits CD and DVD (Essential Squeeze- released 30/04/07) Glenn Tilbrook is also releasing his original demos on CD, the first of these (The Past Has Been Bottled) is also released on 30/04/07.

It can be read as a children's show or a parody of a children's show. Much of the humor has a twist aimed at adults, in the style of Soupy Sales and Pee Wee Herman. The show featured character comedy, puppetry, some audience participation, musical guests, and Floyd's piano playing. One of Floyd's puppet sidekicks \u2013 actually a ventriloquial figure \u2013 was named Oogie. His on-air interaction with off-camera staff and sidekicks is somewhat in the style of what Howard Stern and Chelsea Handler would later do. Local bands such as The Smithereens, The Shades, and R. Stevie Moore, along with such well-known performers as The Ramones, Tiny Tim, Benny Bell, Bon Jovi, Jan and Dean, Peter Tork, Squeeze, David Johansen, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Joe Jackson, and Cyndi Lauper also appeared on Floyd's program. The show's first cast members in 1974 included Pat Cupo, and Marc Nathan, the cameraman. Later members were Scott Gordon, Craig \"Mugsy\" Calam, Richard \"Netto\" Cornetto, Jim Monaco, Art \"Looney Skip\" Rooney, Charlie Stoddard, David \"Artie Delmar\" Burd, and Clark the Wonder Dog. A phonograph album based on the show, The Uncle Floyd Show Album, was released on Mercury Records, and a number of 45 rpm singles on the Bioya label were released around 1979\u201383. Vivino has also released a few CDs as a solo artist. In 1982, The Uncle Floyd Show went into a small syndication circuit which included 17 markets, among them WNBC-TV channel 4 in New York, then WTAF-TV channel 29 in Philadelphia, WPWR-TV Channel 60 in Chicago and WSBK-TV Channel 38 in Boston. It aired right after SCTV on WNBC. The national syndication deal was seen as a huge step forward for the show, which up until that point could only be viewed in and around New Jersey and New York City on a single UHF channel and, at times, local cable. From 1983 to 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show ran on the statewide PBS network, NJN New Jersey Network, which consisted of 4 channels: WNJS (Channel 23, Camden), WNJN (Channel 50, Montclair), WNJB (Channel 58, New Brunswick) and WNJT (Channel 52, Trenton). Starting in late 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show was then seen on statewide cable channel CTN (\"The Cable Television Network Of New Jersey\").[2] During this time, the show went through various incarnations with Floyd sometimes hosting a music-only show, showcasing local bands. Floyd also hosted a show called Uncle Floyd's New Jersey, in which he would visit various towns and businesses in the state. First-run production of The Uncle Floyd Show ended in 1992, with CTN showing repeats until that channel's demise in 1999. In 1998, production of The Uncle Floyd Show began in the Cablevision studio in Oakland, New Jersey. One hundred shows were produced and aired on Cablevision systems throughout the region. Musical guests included Marky Ramone and The Misfits. Although viewer response was enthusiastic, the show was canceled by Cablevision management after the first cycle of episodes.", "otherInfo": "Join Uncle Floyd as he plays the piano and interacts with the audience and the Twin Door Tavern at the Maywood Inn in Maywood, NJ. \n\nEnjoy \"pianology\" at its finest, have some fine food and beverage, and experience a memorable evening with one of today's classic entertainers. \n\nReservations are recommended.

Lyon grew up in Ocean Grove, New Jersey and graduated from Neptune High School. As an artist, Southside Johnny first achieved prominence in the mid-1970s as the second act to emerge from the Jersey Shore music scene and be considered part of the Jersey Shore sound, following Bruce Springsteen. Southside's first three albums, I Don't Want to Go Home (1976), This Time It's For Real (1977), and Hearts of Stone (1978), were Stax-influenced R&B arranged and produced by the co-founder of the band and Springsteen confederate Steven Van Zandt and largely featured songs written by Van Zandt and/or Springsteen. The Van Zandt-written \"I Don't Want To Go Home\" became Southside's signature song, an evocative mixture of horn-based melodic riffs and sentimental lyrics. Other notable songs included \"The Fever\",\"Talk to Me,\" \"This Time It's For Real,\" \"Love on the Wrong Side of Town,\" and the definitive version of Springsteen's \" Hearts of Stone.\" Southside has long been considered the Grandfather of \"the New Jersey Sound.\" Jon bon Jovi has acknowledged Southside as \"his reason for singing.\" In 1982 the Rolling Stone Magazine voted the album Hearts of Stone among the top 100 albums of the 70's and 80's. Cast under Springsteen's long shadow, national commercial success eluded Southside and the Jukes, and in 1979 they were dropped by their record company. Now working without Van Zandt, they released The Jukes in 1979 and Love is a Sacrifice in 1980. Neither of these achieved much success either. The band's first official live release also came out in 1980, the double album Reach Up and Touch the Sky. During the 1980s Southside Johnny's recording contracts continued to change almost by album, but he continued to release records: Trash It Up (1983), a disco influenced album written by Billy Rush and produced by Nile Rodgers; In the Heat (1984) an album trying to reach out to \"Adult Oriented Radio\"; and At Least We Got Shoes (1986) where guitarist and Jersey shore fixture Bobby Bandiera, who often plays a custom guitar built by First Act Guitars took over songwriting and guitar work from Billy Rush and led the Asbury Jukes back to their original sound. Songwriting credits on At Least We Got Shoes also contain a song co-written by Bandiera and singer Patti Scialfa, who was known as a Jukes collaborator since the 1980 album Love is a Sacrifice and who became a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band in 1984. In 1988 Southside Johnny released his first solo record Slow Dance containing ballads and love songs, but also \"Little Calcutta\" which is still discussed as Southside's most political song of his career, describing the life and environment of the homeless in New York City. More record label switches, Jukes personnel changes, tours and club dates followed. His recording career was re-launched with the album Better Days (1991), which featured production by Van Zandt, songs by Springsteen, and vocal performances from Van Zandt, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. With Bobby Bandiera driving the band, the Jukes were gaining new energy for a world wide tour supporting the album. But once again, Southside Johnny's bad luck with the industry was shown when the record label went bankrupt while the tour was still rolling. Southside performed the theme song for the 1990s sitcom Dave's World, a cover of Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right.\" Southside eventually relocated to Nashville taking a break from the music business. A few members of the Asbury Jukes would end up being part of The Max Weinberg 7 on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien television show, while some others went on tour and into the recording studio with artists like Jon Bon Jovi, Mink DeVille, Graham Parker, Robert Cray. In 1998 Southside Johnny came back into the spotlight with an independent release titled Spittin' Fire, a live record with a semi-acoustic Jukes lineup released in France containing a 20 song set recorded during a series of 10 shows at the \"Chesterfield Caf\u00e9\" in Paris, France. After a decade without a record contract Southside finally founded his own record label in 2001 under the name of Leroy Records, and started releasing and distributing his new records fully under his own control: Messin' with the Blues (2000), Going to Jukesville (2002), Missing Pieces (2004), Into the Harbour (2005). Southside continues to perform, and maintains substantial audience followings in some regions of the U.S., such as New Jersey, New York, northeast Ohio, and abroad, in the UK and continental Europe, as 2002's Live At The Opera House DVD, filmed at a sell-out performance in Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrates. As of 2005, he resides on the Delaware Bay. His annual appearances at Springsteen's Asbury Park holiday shows draw as much crowd excitement as Springsteen himself.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Krystyna Hutchinson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7678900.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Stand-up Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022487884-krystyna-hutchinson-at-the-stand-(main-room)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Krystyna is a stand-up comedian, writer and actress living in New York City.

Recorded during the summer of 2007 in the Catskill Mountains, in a house inhabited by spirits (and next door to the home of the original Uncle Sam), the album sees multi-instrumentalists Jesse Gallagher, Sam Cohen, and Jeremy Black weaving through a multitude of styles (psych-pop, groove-funk, cowboy songs, samba/tropicalia) with assured fluidity and inspiration. This is not a band searching for their sound; they have crafted an awesome mix of original material that celebrates the journey through darkness and light. Surrendering themselves to the collective head-space and transformative alchemy of Apollo Sunshine and with help from their friend and co-producer, Quentin Stoltzfus (Mazarin), Shall Noise Upon is an illumination of love in a world of \"dangers\"- real and false. The CinemaScopic arrangements on the album couldn\u2019t have been realized without recruiting a parade of musical friends including: Drug Rug, Edan, Tulsa, Viva Viva, and White Flight. The result is a timely collage of lush instrumentation: drawn from home-made samples and field-recordings to singing bowls and jaw harp. The sounds on Shall Noise Upon come together in an impressionist tour of electrified music. Album-openers \"Breeze\" and \"Singing To The Earth (To Thank Her For You)\", are love-poems to nature and longing, weaving the emotional connection to the world and to each other as one magnetic force, while building and bursting to the sound of cascading autoharp and drippy pedal-steel. \"666: The Coming Of The New World Government\" likens America today to the fall of Rome around anthemic psych guitar scrawl, propellant percussion, and winding vocal harmonies. \"Brotherhood Of Death\" is a brain-buster from the apocalypse that tells the hallucinatory tale of a man intoxicated by greed and power; followed by \"Happiness\", a gorgeous, expansive instrumental, which sounds like an orchestra conducted by Ray Davies. The band is already recreating the depth of these new studio recordings live. That may seem hard to pull off, but for anyone who's ever seen Apollo Sunshine, maniacally switching instruments, producing an extra-terrestrial sea of tones, this is where they shine the brightest. Over the last few years they've toured with Apples In Stereo, Dr. Dog, and They Might Be Giants, Toots and the Maytals and performed at Bonnaroo, Langerado, and Sasquatch. This Fall they will touring all over the US and UK. There is an impression you get from an amazing mix, where distinct parts add up to a unified feeling; and with each play, the range of sounds grow more connected to each other. It's these gifts, \"albums\" traded among friends that inspired Shall Noise Upon. It will have you believing in love, in a world both dangerous and beautiful.", "otherInfo": "Berlin based producer and sound Artist Jeremy Black, known for his eclectic live performances with members of DARKSIDE, Bon Iver, !!!, Efterklang and The Rapture, returns to the Sultan Room for a live curated audio visual mixtape featuring members of Apollo Sunshine, Tycho, !!!, Okkervil River and more"}, {"Address": "66 North 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Sleepy Gonzales ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7191529, -73.96174719999999], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Music Hall of Williamsburg", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022366344-sleepy-gonzales-at-music-hall-of-williamsburg?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Backseat Lovers"}, {"Address": "325 Franklin Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Alice TM ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6883003, -73.9568077], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "C'mon Everybody", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022642262-alice-tm-at-c'mon-everybody?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Joe List ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619738.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Upstairs)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022563570-joe-list-at-the-stand-(upstairs)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "We're Not Banging! w/ Krystyna Hutchinson & Justin Silver!"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Jacob Jolliff ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6347598.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223225, -73.98858129999999], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Country", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 2 w/Michael Daves", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102726728-jacob-jolliff-at-rockwood-music-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "This is the artist page for the mandolin player, Jacob Jolliff.

He grew up playing bluegrass in that grand old tradition of staying up late & singing real loud. Although he\u2019s since moved north, the humid south remains, lodged in his heart and sinus cavities. Heralded as \u201ca leading light of the New York bluegrass scene\u201d by the New York Times, Michael Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, and others in addition to his solo performances. Daves\u2019 most recent project is a two-album set, Orchids and Violence, released February 2016 on Nonesuch Records. Both discs are produced by Daves and have identical track listing of mostly traditional bluegrass songs. The first features straightforward interpretations of them and was recorded live to tape in a 19th-century church by Daves and a band of roots-music innovators: bassist Mike Bub, violinist Brittany Haas, mandolinist Sarah Jarosz, and banjo player and Punch Brother Noam Pikelny. The second disc was recorded in Daves's home studio and includes bass, drums, and electric guitar, mostly played by Daves, and takes a raw, experimental rock approach to the same old-time material. \"The identical track listing makes for a good comparison study,\" says the New York Times music critic Nate Chinen in his review, \"and to his credit, it can be hard to pick which version of a tune is best.\" Daves previously recorded bluegrass standards on Sleep with One Eye Open, a duo session with mandolinist Chris Thile (Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek) which was done live to tape over four days at Jack White\u2019s Third Man studio in Nashville. The album is a collection of 16 traditional tunes by bluegrass legends like The Monroe Brothers, The Louvin Brothers, Jimmy Martin, and Flatt & Scruggs. The duo makes for \"a rip-roaring partnership,\" says the New York Times. \"Bluegrass, in their hands, gets roughed up in the best possible way, with skill and fervor, and a touch of abandon.\" \u201cSleep With One Eye Open\u201d received a 2011 Grammy Nomination for Best Bluegrass Album. Although he is best known as a roots musician, Daves gravitated toward experimental music and jazz while studying at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Relocating to Brooklyn more than a decade ago, he began to crave the social interaction and musical challenges of bluegrass: \"In Western Massachusetts, I was mostly doing jazz. By the time I moved to New York, I was ready to leave that behind, get back to my personal roots in bluegrass music. There were good jam sessions in New York and I was excited to reenter a regular jamming culture in the city. And I was getting back into rock music, too. The Brooklyn scene in 2003 and 2004 was pretty fertile. There was a lot of great, kind of raw, experimental rock music happening at that time, drawing me in, scratching an itch.\" Since 2006 Daves has maintained a weekly residency on Tuesday nights at The Rockwood Music Hall in Manhattan where he continues to draw a devout following, and uses the informal setting to showcase special guest appearances with a who\u2019s who of bluegrass musicians including Noam Pikelny, Chris Eldridge, Sarah Jarosz, and Aoife O\u2019Donovan.

Adding to his varied work with the Aaron Comess Trio, the Aaron Comess Quintet and the improvising collective the Air Conditioned Gypsies, Comess fronts a new and unique lineup for this recording, with the beguiling sound of Leon Gruenbaum\u2019s innovative samchillian\u2122 MIDI controller in the foreground. \u201cThe start of this music,\u201d Comess recalls, \u201cwas Leon and I doing a series of short improvisations with Roman Klun engineering in our studio \u2018his house-Innsbruck Studios\u2019 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I really love the sonic scope Leon gets on the samchillian\u2122, which he invented himself. He really is the secret weapon of this record.\u201d With its deconstructed computer-keyboard interface, the samchillian\u2122 (full name: \u201csamchillian tip tip tip cheepeeeee\u201d) summons an airy sound and a skewed, subtly pervasive harmonic world. It can access pitches in spiraling technical patterns that would be otherwise unplayable. It can execute 40-note-per-octave microtonal scales, overtone scales, spontaneously generated tone rows and many other things of Gruenbaum\u2019s devising. But underneath the sheer technological feat of it all, it\u2019s the instrument\u2019s depth of musicality and gorgeous evocative tone that comes across first and foremost. Comess and Gruenbaum had worked together before in Pat Daugherty\u2019s group New York Electric Piano as well as the Air Conditioned Gypsies. With Sculptures they begin a new collaborative chapter, evincing a deep and unpredictable chemistry. \u201cThe songs \u2018Sculptures,\u2019 \u2018Dogs\u2019 and \u2018Wacky\u2019 were products of our early improvised sessions,\u201d Comess continues. With the addition of Grey McMurray on electric guitar, Oli Rockberger on Fender Rhodes and John Davis on bass, the project came into focus, and what Comess calls a \u201ctriangular\u201d formal structure emerged. On one side were the raw rhythm-based pieces such as the title track; on another were the folk- or rock-like, acoustic guitar-driven songs \u201cBerlin\u201d and \u201cFalling Leaves,\u201d featuring Comess\u2019 highly effective (self-taught) acoustic guitar playing; on still another were the more elaborate, composed pieces such as \u201cSoundcheck-Oceans\u201d and \u201cThe Pink Room. \u201cI think \u2018The Beast\u2019 and \u2018Berlin Part Two\u2019 fall somewhere in between,\u201d Comess adds. It was the cover photograph of Sculptures, shot by Comess on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario, that took hold of his imagination as he began plotting out the album. \u201cThe image played a role in how I wanted the music to sound,\u201d he says. \u201cBased on the sculpture in that photo, I began to see the making of these songs as a kind of musical sculpture. The main goal was for everything to have a strong mood and color to it.\u201d Amid the enveloping sound of Gruenbaum\u2019s samchillian\u2122, the other players all proved equally indispensable. \u201cGrey\u2019s guitar playing was so intuitive,\u201d Comess remembers. \u201cI didn\u2019t have him hear anything before we hit \u2018record,\u2019 and in many cases the first thing he recorded was the one. I was blown away in particular by what he played on \u2018Sculptures\u2019 \u2014 the harmony moves around in odd places and he just opened his ears and moved with it effortlessly and added so much. After hearing that, I knew I wanted his contributions on the rest of the record.\u201d Comess and Rockberger played together for years with James Maddock, the gifted singer-songwriter who contributes guest wordless vocals on \u201cThe Pink Room.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve known Oli for about 10 years and he\u2019s one of my favorite musicians. He has a gift for playing complicated things that sound simple and really connecting with the listener. When Oli told me he was going to be in town a few days I booked a session around him. [Bassist] John Davis plays in Jojo Mayer\u2019s band Nerve; he and I had recently played together and hit it off really well, and I knew his sound and approach would be great for this music.\u201d From the intriguing rhythmic asymmetries of the opening title track and \u201cWacky,\u201d to the pumping dance groove energy of \u201cThe Beast,\u201d to the plaintive and melodic contours of \u201cBerlin\u201d and \u201cFalling Leaves,\u201d Comess brings his eclectic vision into being. His acoustic guitar on the latter two reflects the atmospheric and ethereal approach of his writing more broadly. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of guitar players and do most of my writing on acoustic guitar ,\u201d Comess reveals. \u201cBill Frisell and Daniel Lanois have had a massive influence on my music. I\u2019ve been using different tunings lately, and while spending three weeks in Berlin last year I was stuck on one in particular. I came up with a bunch of song ideas, one of which became \u2018Berlin.\u2019\u2019 Originally from Dallas, Texas, Comess is informed by a wide range of influences and playing experiences, not least his ongoing work as a founding member of the Grammy-nominated funk-rock band Spin Doctors, with a total of 10 million albums sold and over 1500 live shows under their belt with all four original members intact (in 2018 they mark their 30th year). Comess has also spent a decade-plus in the touring band of Joan Osborne, and in 2017 appeared on new releases by her, Rachael Yamagata, James Maddock, Willie Nile, Garland Jeffreys , Chris Bergson and German platinum-selling artist Marius Westerhagen to name a few . He has also worked with Bilal, Edie Brickell, Chris Whitley , Marc Cohen , Roswell Rudd, Ivan Neville, and a host of others. Active as a leader since his 2006 debut Catskills Cry (featuring Bill Dillon and Tony Levin), Comess has released three albums with his most active group, the Aaron Comess Trio (Beautiful Mistake, Blues for Use, Live 2016), featuring Teddy Kumpel and Richard Hammond; and a self-titled 2016 outing with the straightahead jazz-oriented Aaron Comess Quintet adding Keith Loftis and Barney McAll to the mix. Praised by Modern Drummer for his \u201cmusical approach to the kit, powerful stick work, and strong songwriting sense,\u201d Comess reaches new heights of invention on Sculptures.", "otherInfo": "Aaron Comess , Vernon Reid , Steven bernstein , Brad Mehldau , Leon Gruenbaum , Jonathan Maron"}, {"Address": "244 E Houston St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Stoon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8865245.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.722401, -73.985597], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop, House", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "WRITING ON THE WALL", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102799254-stoon-at-writing-on-the-wall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Stoon is one of the most established DJs in the New York tri-state area.

Digable Planets immediately followed up with Blowout Comb, a bold and colorful meditation on Black liberation. While the album did not initially reach the immediate commercial successes of Reachin\u2019, the album has aged beautifully, influencing future generations of Hip Hop heads, young Jazz musicians and Afrofuturists. The trio spent the 2000s establishing their own individual creative voices with Butler\u2019s Cherrywine and Shabazz Palaces projects, Mecca\u2019s work with BROOKZILL! and C Know leading Cee Knowledge & The Cosmic Funk Orchestra. In 2015, the group embarked upon a string of wildly successful live shows and has been very active as a tight touring unit ever since. In 2017, they released Digable Planets Live, a live album that showcases many gems from the group\u2019s catalog as well as the trio\u2019s skill at rocking the crowd with a live band.
