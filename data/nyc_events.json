Born in Spanish Harlem and raised in the Bronx, Palmieri learned to play the piano at an early age, and at 13, he joined his uncle\u2019s orchestra, playing timbales. Palmieri\u2019s professional career as a pianist took off with various bands in the early 1950s including Eddie Forrester, Johnny Segui\u2019s, and the popular Tito Rodriguez Orchestra. In 1961, Palmieri formed his own band, La Perfecta, which featured an unconventional front line of trombones rather than the trumpets customary in Latin orchestras. This created an innovative sound that mixed American jazz into Afro-Caribbean rhythms, surprising critics and fans alike. Palmieri disbanded La Perfecta in 1968 to pursue different musical endeavors, though he would return to the band\u2019s music in the 2000s. Palmieri perfected his arranging skills in the 1970\u2019s releasing several impressive recordings that reflected his unorthodox approach to music. His unconventional style would once again surprise critics and fans with the 1970 release entitled \u201cHarlem River Drive.\u201d This recording was the first to merge what were categorized as \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cLatin\u201d music into a free-form sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz. In 1975, Palmieri won the first-ever Grammy for Best Latin Recording for The Sun of Latin Music (he\u2019s won nine Grammys altogether to date), including two for his influential recording with Tito Puente, Obra Maestra/Masterpiece. Recognizing Palmieri as an American icon, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington, DC, recorded two of Palmieri\u2019s performances for its archives in 1988. Because of Palmieri\u2019s proclivity for creating music in funk Latin style, Little Louie Vega invited him to record on Nuyorican Soul (1997), a release that became very popular in the house and underground music scenes. In addition to the Grammys, Palmieri has received numerous honors: Eubie Blake Award (1991); Most Exciting Latin Performance, presented by the BBC in London (2002); Yale University\u2019s Chubb Fellowship, usually reserved for international heads of state, but given to Palmieri in recognition of his work building communities through music (2002); Harlem Renaissance Award (2005); Jay McShann Lifetime Achievement Award (2008), induction into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame (2008). A year later, the Library of Congress added Palmieri\u2019s composition \u201cAzucar Pa\u2019 Ti\u201d to the National Recording Registry, which at the time only included 300 compositions documenting the history of all of recorded music history in the U.S. With his widely popular eight-and-a-half minute \u201cAzucar Pa\u2019 Ti\u201d Palmieri changed the format of the recording industry, breaking the three-and-a-half minute barrier imposed by the recording industry. In 2012, Palmieri continued to innovate, celebrating 75 years with new music included in the original score for a documentary co-directed by Bobbito Garcia called \u201cDoin it in the Park\u201d that explores the cultural influence of playground basketball on sports and music. Palmieri\u2019s music recorded for the documentary is the basis of his newest recording to be released later this year. This will be Eddie\u2019s first time recording his own new music since winning back-to-back Grammys in 2005 and 2006. In 2013, Eddie Palmieri was awarded the coveted Jazz Master award by the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA). The NEA Jazz Master award is the highest honor an American Jazz artist can receive.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Depending on the hour of the day he's a cultural icon, a rock god, an entrepreneur, a TV star, a father, the face of the American Diabetes Association, a supercross enthusiast, solo artist, Poison frontman, and a generous donor to a myriad of charitable causes. Michaels first rose to fame as the frontman of Poison. As one of rock's most iconic and enduring bands, Poison defined the fast, gritty, and glamorous rock 'n' roll scene. Since the band's beginning, Poison has achieved massive success- releasing eight studio albums, four live albums, and selling over 30 million records worldwide and 16.5 million records in the U.S. alone. The band has charted 10 singles in the Top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 including the number-one single, \"Every Rose Has It's Thorn.\" Twenty-five years after their debut, Poison is still recording music and performing together. Bret Michaels' solo career has been equally successful: his most recent solo album, \"Custom Built,\" released in July of 2010, topped the charts, reaching #1 on Billboard's Hard Rock list. His current solo tour, \"Get Your Rock On\" is selling out arenas across the country and his forthcoming solo album of the same name will be released this summer. Michaels has achieved stunning success in the realm of reality TV as well. His \"Rock of Love\" television series is one of the most successful in VH1's history. VH1 and Bret Michaels teamed up again for his family-oriented 2010 docu-series \"Bret Michaels: Life As I Know It.\" He went head to head with some of the brightest minds in business on Donald Trump's NBC hit, \"Celebrity Apprentice\" and went on to \"Trump\" the competition with his Trop-A-Rocka Snapple drink. Michaels' Trop-a-Rocka Diet Snapple proved to be a fan-favorite- so much so that fans rallied to continue its distribution. He is thrilled to be continuing his partnership with Snapple, remarking, \"When I created my Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea, I made it my mission to design the best-tasting diet drink on earth \u2013 made from the best stuff on earth. Creating Diet Snapple Trop-A-Rocka Tea and donating $250,000 to Diabetes research was just the beginning. I'm thrilled that Snapple will be making Trop-A-Rocka a part of its permanent offering.\" Philanthropy remains an important facet of Michaels' career. A lifelong diabetic, he partnered with the American Diabetes Association in 2010, acting as a spokesperson and sponsor. Beyond his role as spokesperson Michaels has gone on to help Ford raise an additional $400,000 for diabetes research at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction this past February as well as donating numerous items for auction for Diabetes related events. Michaels' charitable outreach extends far beyond diabetes, however. Rocking out and giving back go hand in hand for Michaels, who supports a diverse array of charities and causes. In March 2011, he performed at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in support of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, which gives to those suffering from Parkinson's disease. Michaels was so touched by the event and the cause that he donated $20,000 of his own money to the Muhammad Ali Foundation to help heal those afflicted by Parkinson's. Michaels took on the role of fundraiser as well, raising more than $200,000 for the Barrow Brain Tumor Foundation, with a star-studded dinner in his own home. He is also a supporter of the Camelot Therapeutic ranch and sponsors a horse with his family. The ranch provides services at no charge to adults and children with disabilities. Michaels continues to stretch himself and challenge himself to take on new projects in music, business, and beyond. He recently partnered with legendary guitar company, Dean Guitars, to design his first ever signature Bret Michaels series. Michaels calls Dean Guitars \"the only guitars that can keep up with me, holding up tour after tour.\" He is also actively involved in the world of extreme sports. He created and awarded the first annual Bret Michaels Rock Hard, Ride Hard Award for supercross - a cash prize for the toughest and most tenacious supercross rider of the season - on May 7, 2011. The award will be given out again in 2012. Michaels has teamed with PetSmart for the \"Pet's Rock\" collection, which will debut in 2012. \"As a dedicated pet owners myself, this is a natural partnership for me, and I can\u2019t wait to unveil the collection,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI know my own pets rock, and I wanted to design a line of pet products every bit as fun and cool as they are.\" Also in 2012, Michaels is teaming up with Reader's Digest for their We Hear You America campaign - the popular national, grassroots initiative that serves as a catalyst to empower Americans to help their local communities by casting votes at ReadersDigest.com on behalf of their hometowns. Bret Michaels is the perfect partner for this campaign because he brings his experiences as a survivor, a rocker, a father, a philanthropist, and an American who has traveled this great land by tour bus from coast-to-coast. \"As a musician and an artist, I wanted to get involved in the We Hear You America campaign because it's not only about inspiring people to improve their lives and their communities, but about giving everyone a voice,\" says Michaels. \"It starts with all of you. Go to ReadersDigest.com every day to vote for your hometown. Your votes, joined with others in your community, could get your hometown funds and promotional support from the We Hear You America campaign.\" Bret Michaels may have been in spotlight for decades, but he is certainly showing no signs of slowing down.

Love, and that spark certainly ignites on his 10th studio full-length Love Saves The Day. He calls the new release \u201cthe fullest realization of the hip-hop blues\u201d that he first pioneered with Special Sauce in the early \u201890s. The album, due out October 30 on Brushfire Records, not only features G. Love\u2019s long-term Special Sauce rhythm section \u2013 upright bassist James \u201cJimi Jazz\u201d Prescott, and drummer Jeffrey \u201cThe Houseman\u201d Clemens \u2013 but also prominent guest performers including Los Lobos guitarist David Hidalgo, Lucinda Williams, Citizen Cope, Ozomatli, DJ Logic, Money Mark, Zach Gill and Adam Topol. To create their down and dirty \u201ctrashcan blues\u201d sound, G. Love and Special Sauce returned to Brushfire Records\u2019 Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles. The band was excited to reteam with Sugar engineer and producer Robert Carranza (Jack Johnson, Beastie Boys, Mars Volta). They recorded live with few edits to capture the immediacy of the music: G. Love making his guitar snarl and his harmonica moan, bassist Prescott bringing nimble funk to the bottom end and Clemens\u2019 drum work crackling with power. \u201cThe music,\u201d G. Love enthuses, \u201cjumped off the tape.\u201d The new album completes the trilogy for G. Love that started with 2011\u2019s Fixin To Die. That disc stripped his music down to its roots and saw him record with The Avett Brothers, while Sugar, in G. Love\u2019s words, \u201creconnected the blues with the electric side\u201d and reunited the original trio to create the band\u2019s signature style of blending John Lee Hooker blues with \u201cGolden Era\u201d hip-hop beats. On Love Saves The Day the group dives even deeper, making the grooves heavier, the music rawer and the performances more authentic. G. Love also feels Love Saves The Day is his most rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record yet. Just listen to the title track that opens the album and you\u2019ll hear why. This blast of furious blues, powered by David Hidalgo\u2019s wicked guitar work, stands toe-to-toe with the classic work of Cream and the other blues-inspired bands of the \u201860s and early \u201870s. Hidalgo, a returnee from the Sugar sessions, plays on two other songs, \u201cDis Song\u201d and \u201cThat Girl.\u201d Besides being the first tracks recorded, G. Love sees these three tunes as forming the core of the album. They also lead off the release and set the record\u2019s rugged, raucous tone. This wonderfully unruly spirit flows through the revved-up rendition of the old Leadbelly tune \u201cNew York City,\u201d where G. Love does a delightfully ragged duet with celebrated singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. On the mesmerizing \u201cMuse,\u201d which arose from an all-night writing session he had with his old pal Citizen Cope, G. Love\u2019s sinewy slide guitar drives the tune\u2019s southern rock/hip-hop hybrid groove. \u201cBaby Why You Do Me Like That\u201d kicks off with scratching from another old friend, D.J. Logic, and features the album\u2019s heaviest hip-hop beats. Adding to the groove on \u201cMuse\u201d and \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d is the energetic horn work supplied by L.A. band Ozomatli; however, their contributions really shine on \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d a super funky jam that could have easily been a lost James Brown gem. Although \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d along with the catchy, power-of-love ode \u201cPeanut Butter Lips,\u201d rank as the lighter tunes on the album, the overall lyrical mood, as G. Love easily admits, tends to favor the darker side. Even the seemingly optimistic title track turns heavy towards the end. Standout cut \u201cBack To Boston,\u201d which examines a troubled relationship, was written on a drive from New York City to Boston. Longtime fans will recognize the tune from the acoustic EP Bloodshot & Blue, but G. Love wanted to give it the full-band treatment, with the new version showcasing frequent collaborator Mark Boyce\u2019s jazzy organ work. The rough-hewn performances on tracks like \u201cThat Girl,\u201d \u201cPick Up The Phone\u201d and \u201cR U Kidding Me\u2026!\u201d further reflect the lyrics\u2019 raw emotions, with the sharp-tongued \u201cDis Song\u201d representing the peak of, as G. Love calls it, \u201cpissed-off-ness.\u201d Whether angrily railing about a girl with a \u201cshotgun tongue\u201d in \u201cDis Song,\u201d joyfully leading a party celebration in \u201cLet\u2019s Have A Good Time,\u201d or solemnly addressing love woes on the solo acoustic tune \u201cLil\u2019 Run Around,\u201d G. Love\u2019s vocals vividly express his torn-from-the-heart emotions. He has been putting more emphasis on his singing in the past few years, and feels his vocals on the new album are his strongest ever. G. Love admits that singing with Citizen Cope and Lucinda Williams on this album, and the great session singer Merry Clayton on Sugar, made him raise his game. He certainly has come a long way in the 20 years since drummer Clemens discovered him performing in a Boston pub. The two started playing together and, after Clemens brought in upright bassist Prescott, G. Love & Special Sauce was born. Their self-titled debut, featuring the hit \u201cCold Beverage,\u201d wound up going gold. The band became known for their live shows and performed around the world. G. Love has played with and without Special Sauce over the years, but now the trio is back together and it feels right. G. Love believes the current manifestation of the band is stronger than ever and is riding a creative high, adding \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to kill each other.\u201d Love Saves The Day marks G.

Their sound is invigorating, infused with a captivating honesty that transports audiences to a place of complete enthrallment. The band officially formed in North Carolina in 2006, after front woman Noah Wall met mandolinist Tommy Norris in high school and discovered a convergence of aligned passions. That initial crackle of intensity never waned and instead became the force catalyzing the band through its various iterations. Today, the Barefoot Movement is comprised of Noah Wall\u2014whose powerhouse vocals, songwriting, and fiddle playing serve as the backbone of the band\u2014mandolinist Tommy Norris, and upright bassist Katie Blomarz rounding out their unique blend of charming, modern roots music. The band navigated the pandemic by creating \u201cThe Barefoot Movement Variety Show,\u201d a live stream featuring special guests, live and pre recorded material, and assorted other musical shenanigans and collaborations. Their energetic, joyous, and heartfelt live performances have garnered them fans nationwide and beyond, and earned them the 2014 IBMA Momentum Award for Band of the Year. Their most recent release, 2020\u2019s Rise & Fly, finds them exploring new musical territory while still standing firmly on their barefoot foundation: lush harmonies, thoughtful instrumentation, and memorable melodies. Chuck Plotkin, the producer behind albums such as Springsteen\u2019s Born in the U.S.A., and Dylan\u2019s Shot of Love, among many others, emerged from retirement to co-produce the EP with Hank Linderman, whose engineering work has been showcased on the Eagles\u2019 Long Road out of Eden and Linda Ronstadt\u2019s Hummin\u2019 to Myself, to name but a few.

The name Chuck Treece often arrives with a prelude \u2013 legendary, prolific, influential \u2013 to name a few. Everyone deserves an esteemed title but what\u2019s most important to Treece is having music as his main inspiration in life and becoming the person he set out to become. At first it was all about being a drummer at age 6. But between growing into adolescence, visits to his mom\u2019s in West Philly and trips to the Cherry Hill Skate Park his vision turned to skate ramps and asphalt. When a 13-year-old Treece discovered the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Minor Threat it became all about the music, and the skateboarding, and the skateboarding music. There was certainly a way to be a skater and a musician and, by 1982, Treece claimed the town of Philly to do just that. Thanks to Stacy Peralta (of Dogtown and Z Boys fame) he became sponsored, and within the year formed the punk rock band McRad with fellow skater Zeke Zagar. With McRad and Peralta came skate rock and skate videos such as Public Domain, Ban This, and Propaganda. In the years to follow Treece turned pro, allowing his two worlds to come together in the best way possible. In 1990 Chuck Treece quit pro skating and began focus on a solo music project. The end result is his most memorable session to date \u2013 a full-length album entitled Dream\u2019n (Caroline Records). Around this time Treece worked on remixes through Ruffhouse records for numerous artists including Sting, Amy Grant, and The Goats. 1993 was a year of door-opening opportunities including one of the greatest band and touring experiences ever. After auditioning (and being turned down) to be the new lead singer of Bad Brains in 1989, Treece returned only a few years later as their drummer on three consecutive tours. Life on the road continued as he joined Urge Overkill and toured back to back with Bad Brains. And the other door that opened? Treece started to make a name for himself as a session musician, making his mark, playing bass on the Billy Joel hit album \"River of Dreams\u201d. The session gigs continued and continued working with loads of talented artists like King Britt, Buck-O-Nine, Res and G. Love. His most recent session work includes collaborations with producer Scott Storch for Jadakis featuring Mariah Carey, Kevin Lyttle, and Ricky Martin. Plans are already in the works for future sessions with Busta Rhymes, Floetry, Vivian Green, Sean Paul, and Aretha Franklin. In addition, Treece has continued life on the road with the Mosquitos (opening for the Doobie Brothers, Sugar Ray, and the B 52s) and playing bass on tour (and drums on record) with G. Love & Special Sauce. In the interim Chuck Treece found time to work on a 4-track, bedroom project called Tent and plans to revive McRad by recording new material and re-releasing the old. Treece says, \u201cmusic is my heart and my job and skating is the release when situations in music and life get too stressed.\u201d Treece\u2019s heart and his job come together as two more Philly collaborations are in full force: drumming in the punk outfit Stiffed (fronted by the dynamic Santi White) and producing the debut full-length of rock singer-songwriter sensation Leiana.", "otherInfo": "Tables will be positioned 6' apart, with the front row of tables 12' from the performers. \" Tickets will be sold in \"Table For Two,\" \"Table For Four\" and \"Table For Six\" configurations only.

The more time musicians spend interpreting tunes and interacting with others, the more articulation an audience can expect. You can hear the fruits of such work in the expressive language The Cookers bring to the bandstand and to their five critically acclaimed recordings, Warriors, Cast the First Stone, Believe, Time and Time Again (which was the iTunes Jazz CD of the year in 2014) and The Call of the Wild and Peaceful Heart. This exciting all-star septet summons up an aggressive mid \u201860s spirit with a potent collection of expansive post-bop originals marked by all the requisite killer instincts and pyrotechnic playing expected of some of the heaviest hitters on the scene today. Billy Harper, Cecil McBee, George Cables, Eddie Henderson, and Billy Hart all came up in the heady era of the mid \u201860s. It was a period that found the dimensions of hard bop morphing from their original designs, and each of these guys helped facilitate the process as members of some of the most important bands of the era. Hart and Henderson were members of Herbie Hancock\u2019s groundbreaking Mwandishi group; Cecil McBee anchored Charles Lloyd\u2019s great \u201960s quartet alongside Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette; Billy Harper was part of Lee Morgan\u2019s last group, as well as being a member of Max Roach\u2019s Quartet and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers; while George Cables held down the piano chair in numerous bands including groups led by Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Dexter Gordon and Art Pepper. David Weiss and Donald Harrison, from a more recent generation and the youngest members of the band, are experts in this forthright lingo, having gained experience performing with Art Blakey, Bobby Hutcherson, Freddie Hubbard, Charles Tolliver, Roy Haynes and Herbie Hancock. Each member of the Cookers has spent time leading his own series of groups as well, and each has a keenly individual sound. But it\u2019s the unmistakable power of teamwork that makes this music so commanding and resonates with a kind of depth and beauty that speaks of the seasoned track record of its principals (combined, the group has over 250 years of experience in the jazz world and has been a part of over 1,000 recordings). You can feel the collective weight of that experience in their CDs and especially in their live performances. Since this version of the band was solidified in 2007 the group has performed at venues around the world, including headlining the Newport Jazz Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Playboy Jazz Festival, Vancouver Jazz Festival, Umbria Jazz Festival, Northsea Jazz Festival, Jazz a Vienne, London Jazz Festival, San Sebastein Jazz Festival, Detroit Jazz Festival, Chicago Jazz Festival, Portland Jazz Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival, The Jerusalem Jazz Festival, The Guinness Cork Jazz Festival, The Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, Jazz in Marciac, The Burghausen Jazz Festival, Jazz Terrassa, The Healdsburg Jazz Festival, Jazz Viersen, Ronnie Scott\u2019s, SF Jazz, Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca Cola and Yoshi\u2019s.

But true to the ideals of the era from which they emerged, the band remains fully engaged with the modern, eschewing sentimentality and nostalgia. Their new album, Vicious Voodoo (Humsting Records 2021), carries their music forward and for the first time, features a horn section on every track. The result is a funkier, more upbeat version of their downtown New York sound. Crazy Mary began in 1998, founded by guitarist and songwriter Charles Kibel, a veteran of the Lower East Side rock scene, and drummer Nick Raisz. With seven studio albums to their credit (and two remix albums), the band has enjoyed extensive college radio play, favorable reviews in the New Yorker, the Boston Globe, the Village Voice, and by NBC Nightly News anchor, Brian Williams. In addition, they\u2019ve played several festivals, including CMJ, the Howl Festival, the Nemo, Midpoint and others. Beginning in 2016 Crazy Mary was named a top 30 live band in New York City by Aquarian Weekly three years in a row. The band has played several times a month in New York for many years . Crazy Mary had successful shows in Hollywood\u2019s famous Whisky A Go Go, sharing the bill with Iron Butterfly, The Mau Mau in London, UK, headlining The Portobello Festival and Las Vegas\u2019 Double Down Saloon, expanding their audience to an ever larger crowd. The band is rounded out by vocalist Emma Z, who despite moving home to Australia to raise her son was able to collaborate on Vicious Voodoo via the magic of the internet. The Wizard of Fort Lee is our funky, nutty bass player and Walter Steding is on fiddle. Introduced to the band by Blondie founder Chris Stein, Steding was a pioneer of the No-Wave movement in the late 70\u2019s, the leader of the TV Party Orchestra, Glenn O\u2019Brien\u2019s TV-show house band, in addition to recording with luminaries such as Robert Fripp and Jim Carroll. A solo artist in his own right, Steding was managed by Andy Warhol, for whom he worked as a painting assistant from 1980 up until Warhol\u2019s death in 1987. Warhol produced Steding\u2019s solo album, thereby earning Steding the distinction of being one of the two artists Warhol ever produced \u2013 the other one being the Velvet Underground. The newest members of the band are Robert Aaron on tenor sax and keys and Mac Gollehon on the trumpet. Both started appearing on stage with Crazy Mary in 2015 and are now featured on Vicious Voodoo. Aaron was Wycliff Jean\u2019s musical director for many years and plays the iconic tenor sax solo on Bowie\u2019s Modern Love. He\u2019s also recorded with Mick Jagger, Blondie, Amy Winehouse, Tom Jones, James Chance, Chic and others. Gollehon, nicknamed \u201cChops\u201d by Mies Davis, has been on numerous hit records, most notably Let\u2019s Dance by Bowie and numerous Duran Duran albums. He\u2019s also recorded with Chic, Blondie, Sister Sledge, James Chance and many more. After a year of biweekly rehearsals recording of Vicious Voodoo began in late October, 2019. The process ground to a halt in March, 2020 when the pandemic shut down everything. As restrictions eased, recording proceeded in late June of that year and it was finished in November. Set for release in 2021, Vicious Voodoo moves the band in a funkier direction with the addition of the horns. One final track written during and inspired by the lockdown by contrast is a stripped down blues featuring only slide guitar, snare, bass drum and tambourine.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

When his baseball career officially ended, Adam started booking shows as a solo artist and writing songs with a teammate. He was diligent about posting his work online, and it quickly garnered the attention of established songwriters in Nashville. After several successful co-writes, Adam made the move to Nashville, and his career quickly gained traction. in 2014, SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway selected \u201cI Put It On Ya\u201d as an On The Horizon track.

It can be read as a children's show or a parody of a children's show. Much of the humor has a twist aimed at adults, in the style of Soupy Sales and Pee Wee Herman. The show featured character comedy, puppetry, some audience participation, musical guests, and Floyd's piano playing. One of Floyd's puppet sidekicks \u2013 actually a ventriloquial figure \u2013 was named Oogie. His on-air interaction with off-camera staff and sidekicks is somewhat in the style of what Howard Stern and Chelsea Handler would later do. Local bands such as The Smithereens, The Shades, and R. Stevie Moore, along with such well-known performers as The Ramones, Tiny Tim, Benny Bell, Bon Jovi, Jan and Dean, Peter Tork, Squeeze, David Johansen, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Joe Jackson, and Cyndi Lauper also appeared on Floyd's program. The show's first cast members in 1974 included Pat Cupo, and Marc Nathan, the cameraman. Later members were Scott Gordon, Craig \"Mugsy\" Calam, Richard \"Netto\" Cornetto, Jim Monaco, Art \"Looney Skip\" Rooney, Charlie Stoddard, David \"Artie Delmar\" Burd, and Clark the Wonder Dog. A phonograph album based on the show, The Uncle Floyd Show Album, was released on Mercury Records, and a number of 45 rpm singles on the Bioya label were released around 1979\u201383. Vivino has also released a few CDs as a solo artist. In 1982, The Uncle Floyd Show went into a small syndication circuit which included 17 markets, among them WNBC-TV channel 4 in New York, then WTAF-TV channel 29 in Philadelphia, WPWR-TV Channel 60 in Chicago and WSBK-TV Channel 38 in Boston. It aired right after SCTV on WNBC. The national syndication deal was seen as a huge step forward for the show, which up until that point could only be viewed in and around New Jersey and New York City on a single UHF channel and, at times, local cable. From 1983 to 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show ran on the statewide PBS network, NJN New Jersey Network, which consisted of 4 channels: WNJS (Channel 23, Camden), WNJN (Channel 50, Montclair), WNJB (Channel 58, New Brunswick) and WNJT (Channel 52, Trenton). Starting in late 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show was then seen on statewide cable channel CTN (\"The Cable Television Network Of New Jersey\").[2] During this time, the show went through various incarnations with Floyd sometimes hosting a music-only show, showcasing local bands. Floyd also hosted a show called Uncle Floyd's New Jersey, in which he would visit various towns and businesses in the state. First-run production of The Uncle Floyd Show ended in 1992, with CTN showing repeats until that channel's demise in 1999. In 1998, production of The Uncle Floyd Show began in the Cablevision studio in Oakland, New Jersey. One hundred shows were produced and aired on Cablevision systems throughout the region. Musical guests included Marky Ramone and The Misfits. Although viewer response was enthusiastic, the show was canceled by Cablevision management after the first cycle of episodes.", "otherInfo": "Join Uncle Floyd as he plays the piano and interacts with the audience and the Twin Door Tavern at the Maywood Inn in Maywood, NJ. \n\nEnjoy \"pianology\" at its finest, have some fine food and beverage, and experience a memorable evening with one of today's classic entertainers. \n\nReservations are recommended.

The group formed in London in 1974.

The original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland. Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike & The Mechanics as well as a solo artist. Since the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks.

Surprisingly, virtually all of the youths return. But sometimes they don't. Four out of the original six of the members of The Amish Outlaws were born and raised in Lancaster, PA and had a strict Amish upbringing. No electricity from land lines, no alcohol, no musical instruments, but their spirits were too wild for the Amish lifestyle. Once they trampled in the Devil's Playground, there was no turning back. In the years since Rumspringa, the members of the Amish Outlaws have become very well acclimated to the pleasures and vices of the modern world... music, most of all. It was this mutual love of music that brought the Outlaws together in a chance meeting at the 2002 Pocono Vacation Park \"Rock and Roll Hootenanny.\" While their appearance drew snickers and stares from most of the crowd, they sat down together and the Brothers were soon like brothers, sharing not only the bond of having left the Amish life behind, but also the deep mutual love of music. Together they delved deeply into the 16 years of American culture they missed, watching endless hours of classic MTV, listening to the radio, CDs, records, tapes... anything they could get their hands on. But just listening and watching was not enough...  the Brothers soon decided to form a band that combined their love of the modern world and their traditional upbringing. They met some non-Amish friends out in the world (\"English\" as we call the non-Amish), making them \"honorary Amish\" when they joined the band. Thus, with a bold lust for life and a fire for music and performance that can only come from 16 years of repression, The Amish Outlaws were unleashed upon the world. There is no \"typical\" Amish Outlaws show, but the average crowd can expect to see men in full Amish garb releasing all of their pent up energy with an infectious joy. With a set that is always evolving as the Brothers discover more and more music and culture, The Amish Outlaws constantly surprise the audience and keep them guessing as to what they could possibly play next, from Johnny Cash to Jay Z, Lady Gaga to Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, Bon Jovi to Elvis Presley, The Foo Fighters to Dropkick Murphys, to theme songs from the TV shows they have come to know. Throughout, The Outlaws spin yarns about the Brothers' upbringing and adventures since Rumpsringa. Amish Outlaw gigs are less performances than they are initiations into the life of an Amish Outlaw and parties celebrating the Brothers' newfound freedom.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "40 Wooster St 3rd floor, New York, NY 10013", "Artist": "Plane Station ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11526990.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7222109, -74.00251899999999], "Date": "2021-08-04", "EventDate": "Aug. 4th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Plane Station at Sofar NYC", "moreBioInfo": "Plane Station is a sibling singer/songwriter duo who's indie folk sound is driven by harmony and a devotion to honest lyricism.

The band currently divides it's time between New Jersey and Nashville TN, but perform shows all over the country.

Casey Abrams cooks up that kind of magic on his second full-length and first release for Chesky Records\u2014the aptly titled, Put A Spell On You. Collating together seven covers and six originals, he enchants, entrances, and engages throughout all thirteen tracks. \u201cI wanted to put a spell on the audience with the new record,\u201d he affirms. \u201cI\u2019m mixing a lot of covers that fans have heard live with originals that they\u2019ve never heard before. It\u2019s been fun to write songs about the new and cover things that are old. No matter what though, everything should put you in that kind of wonderful trance.\u201d Spellbinding performance has become something of a tradition for the critically acclaimed singer and multi-instrumentalist. After a head-turning stint on the tenth season of American Idol, his 2012 self-titled debut garnered praise from The Hollywood Reporter, Bass Musician Magazine, She Knows, and many more. Worldwide touring followed as well as numerous collaborations alongside \u201cmusical soulmate\u201d Haley Reinhart, including the holiday hit cover of \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d and a rollicking take on \u201cHit The Road Jack.\u201d 2016 saw Casey successfully complete a PledgeMusic campaign for the independent release of his EP, Tales from the Gingerbread House. In 2017, he re-teamed with Reinhart for two fan favorite songs on her third offering What\u2019s That Sound? Regularly averaging over 200K monthly listeners on Spotify, he spent the year touring internationally as part of the renowned collective Scott Bradlee\u2019s Postmodern Jukebox between launching his own nine-piece \u201cfunk orchestra\u201d via select FunkHaus gigs at venues like Hotel Cafe. In the midst of this whirlwind, he retreated to a decommissioned church in Brooklyn to track Put A Spell On You. During a two-day marathon session, he was joined by the members of his trio\u2014Jacob Scesney [saxophone, caj\u00f3n] and Taylor Tesler [guitar, vocals]\u2014David Chesky in the producer\u2019s chair, and a \u201cmannequin microphone.\u201d \u201cThe church was amazing,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThere was a natural reverb that you can\u2019t get digitally. We recorded using this mannequin with microphones in it. You\u2019re singing to this thing like an audience member and getting real stereoscopic sound. There\u2019s a difference here. The first album was super clean. As time progressed, my sound has gotten more live and dirty. It\u2019s more like you\u2019re sitting in my living room now. It\u2019s very spontaneous and rugged. That\u2019s the beauty of this.\u201d Casey introduced the album with the cyborg waltz of \u201cRobot Lovers\u201d in late 2017 before kicking off 2018 with the single \u201cLet\u2019s Make Out.\u201d A brazen plea for lip-locking punctuated by lyrics about \u201cStar Wars figurines\u201d, a simmering groove, and light bounce, it illuminates the spark at the heart of the new tunes. \u201cI tried to write a song about a loser who wants to make out with a chick, because he never gets to,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s got a little bit of comedy vibe, but real life too!\u201d In the studio, the live combo of his signature upright bass, horns, guitar, and caj\u00f3n add a new dimension to familiar staples a la \u201cMeet The Flintstones,\u201d \u201cHave You Ever Seen The Rain,\u201d and, of course, the title cut \u201cI Put A Spell On You.\u201d \u201cRecording the covers brings things full circle for me,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo many fans got to know me because of American Idol where that was what I did. It\u2019s cool to give them a bit of that. At the same time, I\u2019ve grown so much.\u201d Elsewhere, he picks up the 12-string guitar for the lunar love letter \u201cMoon Song,\u201d while another original \u201cHigh Drunk Love You\u201d proves instantaneously infectious and intoxicating. \u201cIt\u2019s a very common subject,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cWhen I fall in love, I feel like I\u2019m drunk. It\u2019s that initial feeling. You ask, \u2018Is right wrong? Is wrong right? Should I be loving you?\u2019 Everybody goes through it.\u201d In the end, the most magical thing about Casey\u2019s music is how intimate it always remains. \u201cWhen you hear this album, I hope you feel like you were hanging out with me for the whole day at a jam session,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cWith any luck, you\u2019ll want to grab a beer with me after!\u201d", "otherInfo": "Casey Abrams"}, {"Address": "99 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Stand Up Comedy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7296283, -74.0010291], "Date": "2021-08-04", "EventDate": "Aug. 4th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Greenwich Village Comedy Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "637 wilson ave, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Lucy Wijnands ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11261796.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6896109, -73.9058676], "Date": "2021-08-04", "EventDate": "Aug. 4th, 2021", "Genre": "Rhythm & Blues, Contemporary Jazz, Vocal Jazz, Jazz, Vocal", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Lucy Wijnands & Bram Wijnands live in BK", "moreBioInfo": "With her serene, spirited tone, emerging jazz vocalist Lucy Wijnands is a dedicated enthusiast of jazz music from its beginnings to today.

For New Jersey singer/songwriter Tara Dente, that duo of traits is on full display on the new album called Truth In The Mud. Grounded in a kind of rootsy Americana, it\u2019s only after letting each song bloom that one begins to hear all of Dente\u2019s varied influences. From her early years surrounded by the sound of Celtic and church hymns, to her self-guided tour through American vernacular music, you hear solid fingerpicking, storytelling, and a voice that always offers comfort. And from influences as diverse as Nick Drake and Enya, you hear a focus on not just songcraft, but soundcraft - using words and music seamlessly to create a cohesive whole. Since stepping into Asbury Park\u2019s music scene back in 2012, Dente\u2019s reputation has been steadily building, buoyed by her standout 2014 debut called Leave Your Ghosts Behind as well as 2017\u2019s The Gleaner, released worldwide on Travianna Records. With Truth In The Mud, Dente has made her most compelling artistic statement yet. This is the work of an artist in complete command, but still vulnerable to the kind of self-doubt that makes her feel approachable and welcoming. There\u2019s comfort in her songs, because Tara Dente knows what to say - and how to say it - at exactly the right time. Never is that more accurate than on \u2018Hill So Steep,\u2019 the new album\u2019s leadoff track. Despite being written well before 2020\u2019s unprecedented disruption to artistic life, Dente tackles the classic Sisyphean predicament that has become all too familiar for artists living and working in our current environment. As she explains, \u201c\u2019Hill So Steep\u2019 is about a dream I had. In the dream, I was driving up a hill so steep, I felt like I was climbing the steepest roller coaster with no belt on or bar to hold me in and would just fall out. The dream certainly reflected difficult circumstances happening in my life at the time. I was a server at a popular restaurant in my town and did pretty well in tips that day. As soon as I turned the corner walking to my car after work, I noticed it, as well as a slew of other cars, had been towed. The dollar amount it took to get my car back from the auto shop was the exact amount I had made that day in tips. That night, I had the dream. Sometimes you take a step forward, and then take a step right back. But then another day, you'll take three steps forward. You just have to hang in there the best you can and look for the next right thing.\" Truth In The Mud is a giant step forward. And there are many more to come. This is no longer an artist on her way.

They are often credited with bringing rock n' roll back into the mainstream during the late 1980s, resurrecting the styles of bands such as Aerosmith and The Rolling Stones during a time when hair metal and glam rock had been dominating the airwaves. They have released four studio albums, Appetite For Destruction in 1987, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II were both released in 1991, and finally Chinese Democracy was released in 2008. The band was often referred to as \"the world's most dangerous band\" due to their volatile live shows. Stemming from the LA rock & roll underground in 1986, the band signified a shift in rock from slick hair-metal back to gritty, dirty, street-smart rock & roll. The ugly lyrics matched the sleaze of the music--driven by heavy blues licks--covering misogyny, violence, city life, sex, liquor, and hard drugs. They also, however, had a tendency to show sensitivity and a desire to break free from the city. Subsequent albums revealed an influence from bands in the vein of The Rolling Stones and Queen. Their 1987 breakthrough, Appetite for Destruction, (which is the second highest-selling debut album of all-time) 15 times platinum, coupled with the success of the hit single \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" in 1988, took the world by storm. \"Appetite\" was full of raunchy hard rock with blistering anthemic guitar riffs and snarling vocals. It was unlike anything before, it was raw and real with no flaw at all. A follow up EP was made in 1988. \"GNR Lies\" contained 4 songs from their debut EP Live Like A Suicide, 3 new acoustic songs, and an acoustic version of You're Crazy. The album sold well and got into the top 10 alongside Appetite For Destruction. By 1991 they were one of the most popular bands in the world. steven adler (original drummer) was kicked out of the band due to his drug abuse. Matt Sorum replaced Adler. Following the release of GNR Lies, Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 were released. It was a double album that made history by making the number 1 and 2 spots on the American Billboard Album chart. The album was filled with songs that pushed Guns into a different direction. It was far away from the Appetite era and contained more \"epic\" tracks featuring a wider range of instruments (pianos, brass instruments, various effects, etc). The Use Your Illusion albums surprised critics, who expected a double album loaded with hard rock songs, but found more piano-driven tracks. The main response was that instead of releasing two albums that included \"filler tracks\", they could have released one CD. After the release of the albums, the band started a world tour to support the albums. During this tour, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin quit the band due to a combination of being upset with Rose's management of the band and differences between Slash, Sorum, and McKagan due to his newfound sobriety. The historic tour ended in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 17, 1993. The tour set attendance records and lasted for 28 months, in which 192 shows were played. The show in Buenos Aires marked the last time original members Slash and McKagan as well as newcomers Clarke and Sorum would play a live show with Rose. Axl Rose began work on a new album of original material in 1993, but none of the material has ever been released.[24] In 1994, Gilby Clarke left the band, and was replaced with Paul Tobias. That same year, the band recorded a cover version of The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" for the movie Interview with the Vampire. According to Slash's autobiography published in 2007, the first version of guitar track was rejected by Axl - he wanted Slash to copy Keith Richard's playing on the original while Slash wanted to create a 'Guns N' Roses version' of the song rather than copy Keith's style. Reluctantly Slash agreed and recorded another version closer to the original. Slash was further infuriated when he discovered Tobias' guitar copying his own solo note by note layered in the final mix of the song. This would be the last recording by the original version of the band, and five years would go by before any new material came out under the Guns N' Roses name. Slash then drifted in and out of the band for the next couple of years, beginning a side project called Slash's Snakepit. In August 1996, the band returned to the studio, even though McKagan and Sorum were simultaneously touring with their side project Neurotic Outsiders. Eventually, only Slash and Rose were left alone to continue working. During this period, Slash commented in an interview, \"My relationship with Axl right now is sort of at a stand still.\" Additionally, during this period, Axl had approached guitarist Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society) about jamming with the band and possibly joining Guns N' Roses. In 1996 and 1997 Slash, Sorum and McKagan all left the band for good, leaving Rose as the only remaining charter member of the band. Slash, McKagan and Sorum later formed rock supergroup Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and guitarist Dave Kushner. In 1998, a \"clean\" (i.e. profanity removed) version of Use Your Illusion was released (in the USA only), mainly so the album could be sold in Wal-Mart and K-Mart stores. Also in 1998, Axl put a new version of the band together and returned to the studio. This version of the band has been touring and recording sporadically ever since. The new band's membership has changed frequently, but its core members have included guitarist Robin Finck, effects man Chris Pitman, and bassist Tommy Stinson (formerly of The Replacements)\u2014 as well as Paul Tobias, drummer Josh Freese and longtime Guns N' Roses keyboardist Dizzy Reed. In 1999, the band released one new song, \"Oh My God\", which was included on the soundtrack of the film End of Days. The track featured additional guitar work by Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine, Rose's personal guitar teacher. The song's release was intended to be a prelude to their new album, now officially entitled Chinese Democracy. Geffen also released Live Era: '87-'93, a collection of live performances from various concerts during the Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion tours. Also in 1999, during an interview with Kurt Loder for MTV, Axl said that he had re-recorded Appetite for Destruction with the then-new band, apart from two songs which he had replaced with \"Patience\" and \"You Could Be Mine\". In 1999, guitarist Robin Finck departed the band in order to rejoin his former band, Nine Inch Nails, on tour. In 2000, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead joined Guns N' Roses as a replacement for Finck. Josh Freese was replaced with Bryan Mantia (formerly of Primus). Robin Finck returned to Guns N' Roses in late 2000, to complement Buckethead on lead guitar. The revised lineup finally made a public appearance in January 2001, with two well-received concerts, one in Las Vegas and one at the Rock in Rio Festival in Rio de Janeiro. The band played a mixture of old hits as well as new songs from their forthcoming album. The new lineup played a further two shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2001. In 2002, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band because of his frustrations with life on the road. He was replaced by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). The band then played several shows in August 2002, headlining festivals and concerts throughout Asia and Europe. They made their way to New York for a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. In 2002, the band's first North American tour since 1993 was organized to support Chinese Democracy. However, the opening show in Vancouver was cancelled by the venue when Rose failed to turn up (having remained in Los Angeles), and a riot ensued. This tour was met with mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia, tour promoter Clear Channel cancelled the remainder of the tour. The band went on hiatus until they were scheduled to play at Rock in Rio IV in May 2004. However, Buckethead left the band in March of that year, causing the band to cancel. Also in March 2004, Geffen released Guns N' Roses' Greatest Hits, since Rose had failed to deliver a new studio album in more than ten years. Rose expressed his displeasure with this album as its track listing was established without his consent and went as far as trying to block its release by suing Geffen. This failed, however, and the album went triple platinum in the USA. In February 2006, demos of the songs \"Better\", \"Catcher in the Rye\", \"I.R.S.\", and \"There Was a Time\" were leaked on the internet through a Guns N' Roses fan site. The band's management requested that all links to the MP3 files and all lyrics to the songs be removed from forums and websites. Despite this, radio stations began adding \"I.R.S.\" to playlists, and the song actually reached #49 on the Radio & Records Active Rock National Airplay chart in the final week of February - the first time an internet leak has done so. On May 5, 2006, Axl Rose appeared on the Friday Night Rocks with Eddie Trunk radio show (during an interview with Sebastian Bach) and said that the new Guns N' Roses album would be released before the end of the year. Later in May, the band launched a European tour, headlining both the Download Festival and Rock In Rio - Lisbon. Four warm-up shows preceded the tour at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and became the band's first live concert dates since the aborted 2002 tour. The shows also marked the debut of virtuoso guitarist and composer Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, replacing Buckethead. During the tour, former bandmate Izzy Stradlin and ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach made frequent guest appearances. As of 2008, Guns N Roses are: Thomas Eugene Stinson (Bass) Robin Finck (Lead Guitar) Richard Fortus (Rhythm Guitar) Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal (Virtuoso Guitar) W. Axl Rose (Lead Vocals) Chris Pitman (Synth) Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia (Drums) Frank Ferrer (Drums, touring replacement) and Darren \"Dizzy\" Reed (Keyboard and Congas). The band toured extensively in 2006/07, playing to over 750 000 people in over 23 countries. Chinese Democracy had been given the tentative release date of March 6th, then reported September 17, 2007. However both dates passed with no sign of the album. Further release dates of February 11, 2008 and February 12, 2008 were set by HMV and Amazon, and now stand at August 25th, 2008. Acording to the official website the band is \"in negotiations for the release of Chinese Democracy\", as of the 20th of April 2008. Many of the other members of Guns N' Roses (Slash, Duff McKagan & Matt Sorum) now play together in the hard-rock band Velvet Revolver with Dave Kushner and until March 2008, ex-Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland. However, Izzy Stradlin, original GN'R rhythm guitarist and co-composer of many of the band's most successful songs, has not joined them. He did however play a few dates with the new line-up of Guns N' Roses in the summer of 2006, as a guest. Keyboard player Dizzy Reed, while not a founding member of the band (joining in 1990 in the Use Your Illusion period), remains with Guns N' Roses in their current incarnation. On November 24, 2008, Chinese Democracy was released.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Precocious from the very start, Xenia began composing her own songs and poems at the age of 7, and by 15 had taught her-self how to play the guitar, piano, harmonica, and ukulele. Xenia played the instruments off and on throughout elementary and middle school, but it wasn\u2019t until she heard Jon McLaughlin\u2019s \u201cIndiana\u201d that she decided to try singing. While listening to the likes of Billy Joel and Johnny Cash, she\u2019d sing around the house quietly and despite her mother\u2019s urging, the soft-spoken girl tried to initially hide her gift. While in her first year of high school, Xenia reluctantly entered a local singing contest and won. \u201cI\u2019d listen to music and dream about it,\u201d she reveals. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I wanted to pursue it as a career until that contest. I always tried to keep it a secret.\u201d The secret was out, and she began to chase that dream actively. She found out about The Voice auditions in Los Angeles on Twitter, merely two weeks after starting an account. Her parents brought her to the audition, and she nailed it. The NBC show became a massive hit, garnering incredible ratings and soon adding a second season. For Xenia, it was a monumental event. She cultivated a fervent fan base and grew immensely in the process as a result of being on the show. \u201cIt really changed my life,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cEverything was different, and I learned so much about myself, music, and what I wanted to do with my life.\u201d Music has always been an important part of Xenia\u2019s life and, as a result, delivers honest and soulful pop songs with palpable vitality. That energy landed her in the Top 8 on NBC\u2019s hit television show, The Voice, as the youngest finalist. Previously signed to Universal Republic Records, Xenia released her debut EP Sing You Home on December 20, 2011. It peaked at #2 on the iTunes Pop charts, and #10 on the iTunes overall charts. The music video for her EP\u2019s lead single, \u201cSing You Home\u201d, along with her robust, raspy voice gained the attention of celebrities like Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lopez and Avril Lavigne, who shared her music video on their YouTube channels. \u201cSing You Home\u201d has now gained over 700,000 views on YouTube. She has since continued to write, record, and collaborate with other artists. In 2012 she sang a duet on singer-songwriter Jon McLaughlin\u2019s album, Forever If Ever, called \u201cMaybe It\u2019s Over\u201d. Xenia was also featured on Blake Shelton\u2019s first Christmas album, Cheers, It\u2019s Christmas, providing guest vocals for the song \u201cSilver Bells\u201c. Now we await the release of her forthcoming EP, Artemisa, which is titled after her grandmother. Across the landscape of the EP, Xenia paints haunting and unforgettable pictures that are heartbreaking and eloquent beyond her years.

But through mourning came inspiration. \u201cShe was a photographer, and at the wake were all these photos she took,\u201d he remembers. One of those photos struck him immediately. It shows a Mennonite family enjoying a sunny day at the beach while an ominous cooling tower looms in the background. \u201cI said: That\u2019s gonna be the cover of the album that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d That photo captures the spirit of Be Good. While all of Off With Their Heads\u2019 previous work shares a common thread of being rooted in Young\u2019s fatalistic view of the world, Be Good at least allows a tiny glimmer of hope to peek through. \u201cAll the other records were about moping around and feeling sorry for yourself,\u201d says Young. \u201cThis one is less about feeling sorry for yourself and more about accepting how goddamn miserable you are.\u201d Forced acceptance is big theme of Be Good, though it\u2019s a hard-learned one, often emerging in the form of primal screams in the band\u2019s trademark style of gruff-punk. \u201cHands up to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs, til the floor falls out!\u201d Young yells on the title track, sounding somewhere between motivational speaker and hard-nosed therapist. Much of the self-deprecation that defined the band\u2019s previous work has been adjusted. It was the years spent out of the van, developing a life at home in Chicago, that gave Young his newfound, slightly more positive perspective. \u201cNot being on the road 250 days a year, actually trying to develop some sort of life outside of playing shows and drinking, you\u2019d be surprised what that does,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a bunch of weight, I\u2019ve been going to a gym every day, trying not to kill myself all the time.\u201d Young and the band members\u2014bassist Robbie Smartwood, guitarist John Polydoros, and new drummer Kyle Manning\u2014holed up for two and a half weeks at Pachyderm Studios, a mid-century mansion in Minnesota where Nirvana recorded In Utero, to make Be Good. Young produced the record himself, and it was the first time he enjoyed the process, or at least tolerated it. \u201cI don\u2019t like how the old records sound, and I hate recording so much,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could just hear all the dumb shit on them where I was like, whatever, just let it go, I want to get out of here.\u201d Be Good will be released by Epitaph Records on August 16 and, if ever there was a time for Ryan Young\u2019s distinct brand on cautious optimism, it\u2019s now. \u201cThe title is an answer to that question of what you\u2019re supposed to do now that the world is so awful and the climate of this stupid country is so shitty,\u201d he says. \u201cBe good, be loud\u2014that\u2019s sometimes all you can do, I guess, as cheesy as that sounds.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "208 Bond St, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "latewaves ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11515473.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.2161007, -74.0117654], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Indie, Punk Rock, Alternative, Indie Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bond Street Bar", "moreBioInfo": "latewaves is a rock band from asbury park nj that is trying their best.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "147 27th St, Brooklyn, NY 11232", "Artist": "- Low Roller - ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11454517.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.660545, -74.00070500000001], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative Country, Cosmic Americana, Outlaw Country, Honky-tonk, Country, Americana, Alt Country, Bakersfield Sound", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Low Roller w/ Leon Sinks @ Mama Tried", "moreBioInfo": "Low Roller is Daryl Cozzi, Derek Weaving, Ron Muga, & Veronica Davila - A country collaboration that captures the carefree essence of classic West-Coast Americana.

Sounds pretty scary -- but for Chris Pinnella it's the stuff of natural habitat; an environment that the versatile vocalist has thrived in, whether performing with symphony orchestras around the country, leading his own combos of anywhere from 8 to 15 players, or (for several tours of North America and Europe) lending his finely honed skills to the prog-rock / crossover locomotive known as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. That association with the late Paul O'Neil's spectacularly scaled project netted the New Jersey native a platinum record for his contributions to 'The Lost Christmas Eve' tour, and a chance to perform for an audience of over 1 million people, during a particularly raucous New Year's Eve in Berlin. In the process the seasoned young performer - a singer whose influences run from the epic arias of Pavarotti, to the elegant jazz phrasings of Tony Bennett and the next generation concert hall mastery of Bocelli and Groban - built his brand as a bandleader through gigs at venues that range from big city nightspots to theatres across the United States such as The Algonquin Arts Theatre in New Jersey as well as Axelrod PAC, The Great Auditorium, The Pollack Theatre, Rahway PAC, The Newton Theatre, House of Independents, The Grunin Center for the Arts, McLoone's Supper Club and numerous Luxury Private, Charity, Fundraising Galas and Events throughout the country. He has also played such prestigious NYC venues as Birdland, The Rainbow Room, The Explorers Club, The Rose Theatre at Jazz! At Lincoln Center, The Cutting Room, and Feinstein's / 54 Below. Recently, Pinnella was tapped by American Young Voices, singing with the group as one of their guests vocalists alongside massive student choirs ranging from 3000-8000 young singers touring major arenas, including a sold out evening at The Prudential Center in Newark, NJ. Pinnella began his career professionally at the age of 16 after an audition for Maestro Fr. Alphonse Stephenson & the Orchestra of St. Peter performing with the orchestra on and off throughout his career. Chris went on to pursue music and received his degree from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. Post college he worked off-Broadway and regional theatre and had the opportunity to portray the title role of Simeon in the New Musical 'Simeon's Gift' which was co-written by icon Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton-Hamilton. Pinnella spent a month with Ms. Andrews and the 6-person cast at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, NY working side by side until the shows premiere. Pinnella also worked alongside Emmy, Oscar winning arranger Ian Fraser and the Tony nominated John Bucchino and Tony nominated director Marcia Milgrom Dodge (B'Way's Ragtime) on the project. Currently Chris is working on writing and arranging his debut EP which is set to drop in 2020. The 11-track debut will feature mostly original material as well as a re-worked covers, namely Pinnella's always requested version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' will be given an overhaul complete with gospel choir and full orchestra. Infusing elements of jazz, classical, alternative, rock, and pop, Pinnella has his sights set on making 2020 his best year yet. \"Pinnella has been compared to vocal superstars Josh Groban and Michael Buble, but there is no doubt about the fact that Pinnella has a style that is completely his own.

Armed with a vintage Korg synthesizer, the two came together and wrote \"Falling,\" the song that would become the anchor for their new musical endeavor. \"We were down in the studio messing with new and different sounds..\" Nardone states, \"And that opening synth sequence (\"Falling\") just kind of came out of nowhere, and we ran with it.\" It's easy to tell from the song's opening seconds, from the blazing synthesizers, to the soaring vocals, to the gut-wrenching drop of the opening beat, City Vision have captured something special here. The group cites a wide array of musical influences, ranging from rock contemporaries like U2 and Third Eye Blind, to groundbreaking electronic artists like M83 and Kavinsky. Nardone met Dar Franks many years ago, while the two were performing in various different music projects, ranging back to their days in High School. Nardone has also had his fair share of the road, touring nationally with several different bands, and landing on stage with Bono and U2 for a performance in NJ for over twenty thousand in attendance. \"We have made a lot of great memories so far while performing music, but we are mostly excited about what lies ahead\" Nardone says, \"We feel like our creativity is really flowing on this new material, and we can't wait to share it with listeners everywhere.\u201d In November 2018, City Vision released their debut EP, entitled \u201cThe Darkness + The Blinding Light,\u201d across all major digital streaming platforms as well as physical copies available on the band\u2019s website. The band also expanded to a four piece live band, enlisting the services of bass guitarist Erik Raj and guitarist Vincent Auletta to add sonic depth to the City Vision live concert arsenal.

I was taken to one of your shows recently by my niece Ana. Now I must admit, I\u2019m not well-versed in the amorphous, genre-defying spirit of the time (which you so casually seem to channel). But I\u2019m home now in my cabin in the Catskills and I felt compelled to write you this note urging you to show yourself. Were you busy? Shy? Have you been dead for a while? The boys on stage seem to hold you in their midst like a seance, indeed I spoke to all of them individually and, like your totems they are all well-chosen, each a figure of the ceaseless joy that pervades from your opening till the end of the party after the party you invited us back to. They glide through the human verve of a barn dance, the esoteric channeling of electronic sounds I am, alas, so unfamiliar with (though Ana tells me your instincts are so correct as to already have stretched way beyond the pale of what the uninformed would call \u2018Ee Dee Em\u2019). At times they sing together like sacred harps, evoking some ritual (I saw their fans at the front, eyes half-lidded, trancing, mouthing every word, even when they push those words through their strange machines). Other times they break into some elevated heartbeat of the future, like a gang, syncing up in the darkness of the stage but always in the light of the mind. The experience is rapturous. Ah, I\u2019ve digressed. You know, I\u2019m not even sure that Psymon Spine exists; is it a code, an orginazation? PSY for psychedelic, MON for the harmonious way you hold each other musically through even the weirder turnings of your set, the snaking through modern and ancient, folk, doom, trance music. The SPINE must then be all of you together, and me perhaps - as a newcomer, that current below which mysteriously unites everything. If Psymon Spine does exist, please wish him well on the other side, or in whichever dimension he now dwells. Please continue, my friends, for the sake of all those I saw leaving your show drenched in sweat, smiling, the young and the old alike whom I saw forget themselves among your sonic fray. Excuse this scribble; I am sending it without permission of my niece, who insists the mystery is part of why we come. Tell Psymon thank you, tell him he's left his ghost in very capable hands.

The New York City band sounds like someone spinning a radio dial with such passionate intensity that all the stations blend together into a single, transcendent, almost spiritual force. It\u2019s disco to the beat of modern house; it\u2019s a Supremes cover of a Cardi B banger; it\u2019s Roland Kirk playing jazz through one saxophone, funk through another, and the most earwormy pop tune the 1970\u2019s could muster through a third. It\u2019s an experience\u2014one so effecting that with only a self-released 12\u201d single in circulation, 79.5 had been written up twice in The New Yorker on the merit of their live sets alone. Still, all this mixing and matching, this manic twirling of an FM dial, might seem like a bit of a mess: a recipe for ungrounded noodling and static. And perhaps it would be, were these disparate influences not anchored so solidly by the delicate crunch of singer and narcissist keyboardist Kate Mattison\u2019s Fender Rhodes. The Rhodes is the throbbing heart of 79.5, the melodic grit that gives its pristine vocals their edge. And like Mattison, it is the touchstone around which the band was built. Though the genesis of 79.5 was defined more by an organic growth than a singular event, the band could begin its origin story in 2012, the year Mattison renamed her band after an imaginary radio station, one that acted as a mercurial melting pot for genres as varied as house, soul, disco, jazz and new jack swing, all seasoned with an AM Gold crackle. Whenever, wherever 79.5 began, the band that has since coalesced around Mattison\u2019s Rhodes is comprised of individuals who have an inextricable connection between music and their paths through life. \u201cBoy Don\u2019t Be Afraid,\u201d the first single off of Predictions, showcases the sleek musicianship and palpable joy that course through entire record. Produced by Big Crown Records co-founder Leon Michels, Predictions is a timeless journey through a New York City dreamscape\u2014where spring never ends, the clubs never close, and new love is always right around the corner of the next city block. Mysterious, classy, and underscored with a simmering passion, the record captures the infectious mood of 79.5\u2019s live sets, transporting listeners directly to the front of the stage. There\u2019s a reason radio stations as eclectic as 79.5 don\u2019t exist. People tend to gravitate towards a specific type of music in a given moment, one that syncs up with their emotional state or that satiates their particular taste. But somehow the blend of influences 79.5 has synthesized hits a sweet spot that feels at home in nearly any moment, any setting. Disc Jockeys across all wavelengths love to remind their listeners not to \u201cflip that dial,\u201d but tuned into 79.5, it\u2019s unlikely anyone would ever want to.", "otherInfo": "LIVE IN THE SULTAN ROOM"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Bettye LaVette ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8294634.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "R&b", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "An Intimate Evening with Bettye LaVette ", "moreBioInfo": "Bettye LaVette is no mere singer.

Now, in her 55th year in show business, she has been signed to Verve Records, and has recorded an album of all Bob Dylan songs. Things Have Changed is a masterpiece of interpretation of the songs of one of the greatest songwriters alive, by one of the greatest soul singers alive. Bettye has recorded Dylan songs in the past, but this is the first time that she has devoted an entire album to one writer. She will be performing the album in it's entirety, along with other songs from throughout her career. Her career began in 1962, at the age of 16, in Detroit, Michigan. Her first single \"My Man - He\u2019s a Loving Man\", was released on Atlantic Records. She recorded for numerous major labels, including Atco, Epic, and Motown, over the course of the 1960s through the 1980s. The 2000's started what she calls her \"Fifth Career\". Her CD, A Woman Like Me, won the W.C. Handy Award in 2004 for Comeback Blues Album of the Year. She was also given a prestigous Pioneer Award by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation. She has received Blues Music Awards for Best Contemporary Female Blues Singer and Best Soul Blues Female Artist. She recorded 4 CDs for hipster indie label ANTI- Records over the course of 8 years, 2 of which received Grammy nominations. Her 2015 CD, Worthy, was also nominated for a Grammy. Although still not a household name, fans, critics and artists have nothing but high praise for her live show and her interpretive vocal skill. Now 72 years old, she is still performing with the ferocity of a woman half her age. She is one of very few of her contemporaries who were recording during the birth of soul music in the 60s and is still creating vital recordings today.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "85 Westchester Ave, Pound Ridge, NY 10576", "Artist": "Alex Cano ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11516311.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.1912227, -73.5528332], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "Alt-rock, Folk Rock, Rock, Alt-country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Alex Cano at North Star ", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1260 Ave of the Americas, New York, NY 10020", "Artist": "Tony Bennett ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8860704.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7599893, -73.9800542], "Date": "2021-08-05", "EventDate": "Aug. 5th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Radio City Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Guests must have proof of full COVID-19 vaccination - Final Dose 14 Days Before Event.

Ese fue el comienzo. Diez a\u00f1os de giras enloquecidas, fan\u00e1ticas adolescentes al borde de la histeria, camisas ra\u00eddas y mil historias compartidas en el camino, fueron suficientes y le llevaron a decidir buscar su propio camino, solo.

Cuando empezaba a pensar en su siguiente trabajo, Para que no me olvides se filtr\u00f3 en Colombia y se volvi\u00f3 un \u00e9xito, logrando esta vez Disco de Platino y renombre internacional.

Such is the theme of Curtis\u2019 latest release, ONE LAST STAND, a high-energy concept album that takes you across the great divide: a journey from adolescence to adulthood. Curtis released the album in 2015 just before hitting the road again for a North American tour. The album featured a recording of \u201cBootleg Gasoline\u201d which was also made into a music video in 2016. Renowned San Diego radio personality, Jim McInnes, has referred to the record as \u201cOne of the best recordings I\u2019ve heard in a long time.\u201d The album is now available on CD or through Amazon / itunes. Curtis began his career leading his the all-star L.A. band 7th Sun. In 2008, the band released their debut album FROM THE BEGINNING, featuring Adam Kury (Candlebox), Stephen Quadros (Snow) and Micheal Russeck (Quactus) Produced by Curtis, the album was nominated \u201cBest Independent CD\u201d by Southbay Music Awards, and praised by Music Connection for the band\u2019s musicianship, particularly Curtis\u2019 guitar work: \u201cJT Curtis' formidable fretwork recalls the likes of Clapton, Allman, and Page.\u201d The album is still available across the internet. Near the end of the decade, Curtis stated a notable YouTube series called \u201cOne Man Band,\u201d where he covered classic rock songs, performing all the instruments himself (guitar, bass, keyboards, drums and vocals). In 2010, JT Curtis produced his first solo release, the funky rocking MAKE IT TO THE BRIDGE / THE UNCIVILIZED CITY. With provocative lyrics and intense gut-grabbing music, this single is a must-have! Unable to clone himself for live performances, Curtis formed his own band, Mad Mongoose, collaborating with New York's top musicians (Arthur Migliazza, Darcy MacRae, Tetsuya Sato, and others). The band uploaded a live performance of the Curtis penned funk-rock tune, \u201cShake it Off,\u201d featuring Curtis\u2019 masterful slide work and Migliazza\u2019s dynamic piano playing. \u201cShake it Off\u201d became am irresistible fan favorite, leading Curtis to officially release the song in 2013, backed with another original tune, \u201cNo Room to Move.\u201d Beginning 2015, JT Curtis began hosting a YouTube series called \u201cThe History of Rock & Roll\u201d discussing the genera\u2019s history decade by decade, with a little help from his friend Nick Patrella. Curtis has backed up many powerful artists and groups. In 2013, he was a featured performer in the Broadway musical LET IT BE. In 2009, he performed for Jimmy Carter\u2019s 85th Birthday with the award winning St. Genevieve High School chorale. Curtis has also worked with Shooter Jennings, Oscar Brashear, Nite-Time, Starlight Orchestras, Becky and the Blu-Tones, eTheReal Soul, The B.O.L.T. and countless others. Back in the studio, JT Curtis is a producer, engineer and writer for television; having produced several production pieces for music houses in Los Angeles and New York: CBS, Ed Wood Music, Bing Bang Boom and Man Made Music.

It just doesn\u2019t sound like it.\u201d This is how virtuoso guitarist Oz Noy describes his intoxicating blend of jazz, funk, rock, blues, and r&b. Born in Israel, Oz started his professional career at the age of 13 playing jazz, blues, pop and rock music. By age 16, he was playing with top Israeli musicians and artists. By age 24, he was one of the most established studio guitar players in the country. Oz was also a member of the house band on Israel\u2019s top-rated television show for more than two years. Since his 1996 arrival in New York, Oz has made a huge impact on the local and international music scene. His unique and intoxicating style has broken all the rules of instrumental guitar music by focusing on the groove. All stars such as Keith Carlock, Anton Fig, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Dave Weckl often contribute on drums, with bassists Will Lee, James Genus, and Reggie Washington. In 2003, Oz released his debut record \u2013 \u201cOz Live\u201d \u2013 recorded at NYC\u2019s legendary Bitter End. In 2004, Oz signed with Magna Carta Records and in 2005, released his highly-acclaimed studio record \u201cHA!\u201d with his all-star band featuring Fig, Carlock, Lee and Genus plus special guests Mike Stern and George Whitty. In April of 2007, a licensing deal with Magna Carta and Japanese label Videoarts opened the door for Oz's music in Japan. Later that year saw the release of \u201cFuzzy Feat,\u201d Oz\u2019s third record under the Magna Carta label. For Fuzzy Feat, Oz\u2019s all-star band is joined by various special guests including Colaiuta, bassist Jimmy Johnson, and keyboardists Whitty and Jim Beard. September 2009 saw the release of Oz\u2019s fourth album, \u201cSchizophrenic,\u201d featuring Lee, Fig, Carlock, Weckl, Ricky Peterson, Chris Palmero, and special guest Steve Lukather. November 2011 Oz released his fifth studio album \u201cTwisted Blues\u201d Featuring Vinnie Coliauta, Anton Fig, Chris Layton, Will Lee, Roscoe Beck , John Medeski, Jerry Z, Reese Wynans, Ralph Macdonald and special guests Eric Johnson & Allen Toussaint. In late 2012 Oz released his two highly acclaimed instructional DVD's,\"Guitar Improvisational Workout\" and \"Play Along Workout\", released by jazzheaven.com . For his accomplishments as a trend-setting guitarist, Oz won the highly acclaimed Guitar Player magazine readers poll for \u201cBest guitar riff on a record\u201d in 2007, \u201cBest new talent\u201d in 2008, and \"Best out there guitar player\" in 2013.

Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019.

Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves.

She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC.

He's a singer of clear tenor with an emotional range befitting that of his namesake Bob Dylan. During his college years he maintained an esprit de corps with fellow pop song enthusiasts. In his twenties he whittled it down to a foursome fierce with alt-rock sensibilities named M.Headphone with whom he stormed the San Francisco music scene from 1998-2003. A solo artist since 2004, Connor is set to release his 5th full-length in the first half of '21. In contemporary quarantine fashion, the new record is a Kickstarter-funded effort that sees the artist playing virtually all instruments. With producer Coley O'Toole of the platinum-selling band We The Kings behind the boards for this new batch of songs, Connor expands his sonic soundscape while sharpening his thematic focus. The tentatively titled \"Infinity Days\" will be available on all major digital platforms. Son. Husband. Father. Teacher. Humanitarian. As a lyricist, Dylan Connor's subject material draws from such titles. Rooted in the craft of classic singer/songwriters and inspired by cultures of the world, Connor continues in the tradition of Billy Bragg, Ben Folds, and Tom Petty. Present-day comparisons include Dawes, Nada Surf, and Phoebe Bridgers, while Connor himself claims kindred spirit influences including Jeff Buckley, Matthew Sweet's power pop, and Death Cab For Cutie. 2004's \"Plug In\" marked the first of four collaborations with acclaimed producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads) and saw Dylan Connor recognized by American Songwriter Magazine with a nod for Best Lyrics. Ten years and several album/touring cycles later, Connor released 2014's \"Blood Like Fire (Songs For Syria)\" \u2013 a charity project highlighting the war in Syria with 100% of proceeds allocated to the education of Syrian refugees via the Karam Foundation. Connor then contributed his song \"Man of Peace\" to the 2016 feature film documentary \"Little Gandhi\" by writer/director Sam Kadi that became Syria's first official submission for \"Best Foreign Language Film\" during the 90th Academy Awards. Connor also serves as Chair of Missions for the Syrian-American Council and has embarked upon humanitarian expeditions to the Syrian border to deliver aid and help raise awareness in solidarity with all those affected by the nearly decade-long war. Connor first came to love the country and its people after having married a Syrian immigrant and making several visits to her homeland. The spiritual union with his Syrian partner led to the cognizant evolution of his art. Once the revolution began, Connor knew he would not remain silent. \"If Only You'd Listen\" (2019) \u2013 a single co-written and produced by Coley O'Toole \u2013 features Connor's empathetic voice amidst an ornate, Beatles-esque arrangement. A song of stately immediacy imploring adult listeners to take action on behalf of children amidst today's combined crises of climate change, gun violence and war, \"If Only You'd Listen\" has over 8 million streams online. February 2021 sees Dylan Connor contributing his current single \"Bring You Back\" to the theatrical and VOD release of \"Adverse,\" a new crime thriller starring Sean Astin and Mickey Rourke. \"Bring You Back\" was commissioned by writer/director Brian Metcalf after being impressed by Connor's talent, sincerity and knack for melody. Produced by Brooklyn-based musician Mark Mollica, \"Bring You Back\" strikes an elegiac tone while demonstrating Connor's ability to collaborate on another's creative vision. Anchored along the Connecticut shoreline where he lives with his wife and two children, Dylan Connor teaches Latin to high schoolers in between concert performances at venues like NYC\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, L.A.\u2018s The Mint, and CT\u2019s Fairfield Theatre Company.", "otherInfo": "Every Friday (almost) I will be playing a solo show at Las Vetas Lounge as I get warmed up for the release of my new record Infinity Days and for a fall 2021 tour."}, {"Address": "325 Franklin Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238", "Artist": "Kala and The Lost Tribe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7926843.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6883003, -73.9568077], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Jazz, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "C'Mon Everybody", "moreBioInfo": "Arianna \"Kala\" Brame is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer, poet and MC based in Brooklyn, NY.

His sister Sara Watkins, also a member of Nickel Creek, plays violin and sings background vocals on the second of his two solo albums. As a whole, Nickel Creek recently participated in a project dubbed Mutual Admiration Society, a collaboration with former Toad The Wet Sprocket singer Glen Phillips. As a solo musician, Sean Watkins early material was contemporary bluegrass, but as time goes on, he has incorporated various other influences into his music (especially indie rock). Sean Watkins's solo music career seems to be going the same path as Nickel Creek; turning from beautiful traditional bluegrass songs to indie rock with bluegrass instrumentation. Sean Watkins is the oldest member of Nickel Creek. \"My first instrument was the piano when I was six\", Sean recalls. \"I took classic instruction for seven years, but three years into that I discovered bluegrass music, through my piano teacher's son, who had a bluegrass band that played every Saturday night at a pizza place in Carlsbad. I really got into it, and when Sara [Watkins] and I met Chris, we started playing with him on Saturday nights too.\"[1] He began playing mandolin in the early career with Nickel Creek, but later switched to guitar. Sean made it to the National Flatpicking Championship in 1993 at age 16. Now Nickel Creek has exploded in the contemporary folk/bluegrass scene. This Watkins has already released 3 solo albums and appeared on many others. Of this experience, Watkins has said, \"I've learned now to look back to music that has lasted through the years and to appreciate the timeless value that it has.\" Sean's first album Let it Fall consists primarily of bluegrass inspired instrumental tracks. Providing the vocals on the only sung track on the album is former Toad the Wet Sprocket frontman Glen Phillips. Sean's second album, 26 Miles was a much bigger departure from bluegrass. While still mainly acoustic, the album showed influences from jazz, indie rock, and new age music. His third album, Blinder's On continues along many of the same lines as the previous one. It was recently announced on Nickel Creek's website that the band would go on hiatus at the end of 2007. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Sean states that he plans to make music for movies.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "300 Richardson St, Brooklyn, NY 11222", "Artist": "Slut Magic ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11561915.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7195579, -73.93942059999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Post Punk, Indie, Rock, Alternative, New Wave, Riot Grrrl, Garage Rock, Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "18th Ward Brewing Double Header", "moreBioInfo": "\"All those pretty, bi-looking people back there must be the Slut Magic crew.\" - overheard at Slut Magic show Slut Magic is an angsty, sonic make-out session from Brooklyn, New York.

Her first, 2017's Infinite Worlds, was an indie breakthrough that put her on the map, prompting Tamko to tour around the world and quit her job in electrical/computer engineering to pursue a career in music full-time. Tamko's Nonesuch Records debut All The Women In Me, finds her in a state of creative expansion, leaning fully into some of the experimental instincts she flirted with on the previous album. This time around, she's throwing genre to the wind. All The Women In Me is a vibrant culmination of influences, emotional landscapes, and moods; a colorful and masterful statement by an artist and producer stepping into her own. \"I was in a pretty tortured headspace when I returned home from touring Infinite Worlds. That album contained some of the first songs I'd ever written, and more people than I could have ever imagined heard it,\" Tamko says. \"I was proud to become a full-time musician and recognized how rare of a thing that is, but was also debilitated by the very same fact. Fear overtook me and I couldn't write. I felt stagnant and unsure of what to do next.\" That anxiety eventually thawed and gave way to a newfound sense of freedom as Tamko began to focus less on industry pressures and more on honing her craft as a songwriter and producer. \"With this album, I wanted to impress myself,\" Tamko says. \"I wanted to be curious and I wanted to make big leaps as a producer. All I had access to on the road was my computer and Logic, so naturally I started writing songs electronically with what was at hand.\" All The Women In Me was written and produced entirely by Tamko. Guitar-driven melodies are largely absent, and in their place we are treated to a collection of songs buoyed by hybridized analog and digital arrangements. While Infinite Worlds situated the last Vagabon project in the realm of \"indie rock,\" All The Women In Me is not easily defined. Grounded by Tamko's expressive voice and knack for unique melodies, the album flits between genres, never lingering too long on one particular sensibility. Lead single \"Flood Hands\" exemplifies this growth; the production ebbs like a gentle tide before a cavernous drumbeat kicks in and the tone shifts completely. \"I know, even if I run from it I'm still in it,\" Tamko sings over and over again, her capacious voice conveying a sense of resignation in the face of an external force beyond her control. The chorus is a hypnotic bit of pop alchemy that lingers long after the runtime. \"The drums and vocal forward approach I took on All The Women In Me is drawn from my love for rap and hip-hop production as well as R&B and folk storytelling. That's the music that got me excited about writing again,\" Tamko says. In addition to those influences, the West African guitars and rhythms that soundtracked much of her childhood seep into moments throughout this album, in no place more obvious than on \"In A Bind.\" The song opens with a fingerpicked melody as Tamko sings to someone she's been orbiting for a while but can't quite reach. \"I know that I was gone a lot last year/ But I hoped you'd still be here,\" she sings. After that, words no longer serve, and lyrics are replaced by robust, choral vocals singing the refrain: \"Uh-huh, yes, uh-huh.\" \"I drew some inspiration from the Malian musician Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 while writing that song. There is a part on his song 'Savane' where he and his band are feeling the music so much that he just says, 'Yes,' in the middle of the track,\" Tamko explains. \"It's almost as if the music is coming from a higher power. That's a staple in so much of the African music I love, and when I started writing 'In a Bind' I was overcome in a similar way.\" Tamko didn't set out with one particular lyrical theme in mind when she started writing All The Women In Me, and as a result, this album offers up a spectrum of moods to marinate in. Songs like the album's opener \"Full Moon In Gemini,\" the thumping bedroom dance track \"Water Me Down,\" and the collage piece \"Please Don't Leave The Table\" illustrate blinding moments of personal insight that speak to universal themes. Other lyrics came to Tamko with clear intention. Inspired by a Nayyirah Waheed poem, the title track, \"All The Women,\" is a thesis statement, though it arrives near the very end of the album. \"This song poured out of me and showed itself as an anthem for myself and for all of the people who are marginalized by our society. 'Women' in this case isn't gendered, it's a placeholder for those who are not always welcome and not always protected. This song exists for all of us to see each other and find each other,\" Tamko says. \"The song is also a thank-you letter to the women who raised me, the women who look like me, the women who work in all of the genres of music that guided this album, 'the women who run with the wolves.'\" On \"Wits About You,\" Tamko opens up more space for those who have found themselves positioned as The Other when she sings: \"I was invited to the party/ They won't let my people in/ Well then never mind, never mind, never mind.\" Later, the stunning slow burn \"Home Soon\" finds Tamko meditating on what it feels like to truly belong to a place, a community. She's joined by a consortium of friends, who sing along with her over a trembling string arrangement. \"At dawn, I'll be home soon,\" they affirm in unison. \"Home has always been a major theme in my music, and when I say I make music for outcasts, I am also talking about those who feel far from home or uncomfortable where they're at,\" Tamko says. \"To me, home isn't a physical space so much as it is a mental state. I'm writing about wanting to feel safe and at home in my body and in my mind and in the community I move in. I want Vagabon to be a project that people searching for the same thing can connect with.\"", "otherInfo": "Vagabon"}, {"Address": "1072 Ocean Ave, Sea Bright, NJ 07760", "Artist": "Sean Patrick NJ ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11210063.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.3626827, -73.974394], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Acoustic, Pop, Emo", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ocean House Tap and Grill", "moreBioInfo": "In a career consisting of touring the East Coast & recording with his long time original band and a decade of fronting bands in the NJ cover scene, currently the last 5 years with Lifespeed; for the first time, Sean Patrick is journeying out on his own with solo shows currently booking throughout New Jersey and two musical projects to be unveiled in 2020.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "187 Graham Ave, Kings County, NY 11206", "Artist": "Kerry Coddett ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7251094.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7084504, -73.9436339], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Kerry Coddett: LIVE Stand-Up Comedy Set", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "40 Jesup Rd, Westport, CT 06880", "Artist": "The Lone Bellow ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9543509.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.1409323, -73.3613992], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Levitt Pavilion for the Performing Arts", "moreBioInfo": "The Lone Bellow burst onto the scene with their self-titled debut in 2013.

Their monthly show at L.A.\u2019s famed venue Largo has been hailed as a convivial, communal event where they welcome an impressive array of musician friends old and new. While it\u2019s true that fans who aren\u2019t lucky enough to be in L.A. and score a coveted ticket can check out the proceedings via youtube or on the podcasts the Watkins siblings have created, the fun of these evenings is really in being there as the unscripted show unfolds. The Watkins Family Hour is always full of surprises, unexpected guests, one-of-a-kind match-ups; serendipity plays as much of a role as virtuosity. Fiona Apple often joins them, and recent guests have included Dawes, Jackson Browne, Nikka Costa, Booker T. and actor-singer John C. Reilly, as well as comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Nick Kroll and Pete Holmes. Now Sara and Sean have decided to take their Family Hour format on the road -- a kind of musical pop-up shop, if you will -- to clubs and concert halls around the country. And to mark this undertaking, this summer they are releasing the first-ever Watkins Family Hour LP on their own Family Hour Records imprint. The album, recorded live over three days in the studio of their friend and producer-engineer Sheldon Gomberg, beautifully captures the freewheeling spirit of the shows. It features Apple and the stellar players who have become a de facto house band: drummer Don Heffington, pedal steel and dobro player Greg Leisz, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and keyboardist Benmont Tench, each of whom take a vocal turn at the mic. The Watkins Family Hour is an all-covers affair; tracks include Sara doing Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s \u201cSteal Your Heart Away,\u201d Sean essaying Roger Miller\u2019s wistful \u201cNot In Nottingham,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 1973 animated Robin Hood, and Apple singing \u201cWhere I Ought To Be,\u201d originally performed by Skeeter Davis. On tour, the Watkinses plan to make every venue they visit a home away from home. In each town, they\u2019ll extend an invitation to the many artists they\u2019ve befriended over the years -- through their touring in Nickel Creek, as solo artists, and as frequent collaborators with other like-minded musicians from the worlds of bluegrass, folk, country and rock. \u201cTaking the Watkins Family Hour on tour and releasing this record feels like the right next step,\u201d says Sara. \u201cThe show is about a community of players and that community stretches across the country. If we can\u2019t get everyone to L.A. to do our show, we\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cThe Family Hour has always been something we\u2019ve really loved,\u201d echoes Sean. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing outlet for us for so many years. Until recently we had thought of it as just an L.A. thing at Largo. But now we feel it\u2019s time to take the show out to more people.\u201d Sara and Sean, raised in the San Diego area, were eight and twelve years old when they partnered, on fiddle and guitar respectively, with eight year old mandolinist Chris Thile in 1989 to form Nickel Creek. By 2002, the prodigious trio had garnered a Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy for its second album, the Allison Krauss-produced This Side. Sara and Sean learned about the original Largo on Fairfax Avenue from Toad the Wet Sprocket singer-songwriter Glenn Phillips and it became their go-to local spot. They started out as audience members but soon were coaxed on stage. Owner Mark Flanagan fostered an open, cooperative environment that attracted an eclectic list of regulars, most famously musician-producer Jon Brion, who established a popular weekly residency, as well as musicians like Aimee Mann, Michael Penn and Brad Mehldau. Fiona Apple has long been a familiar face, often joining Brion and now becoming an integral part of the Family Hour. As Sara recalls, \u201cOne day Flanny said to us, you guys should have a show; we\u2019ll call it the Watkins Family Hour. I don\u2019t care if only seventeen people come. And we said okay. We invited a friend of ours, Gabe Witcher [now a Punch Brother], to play fiddle with us. For each show we\u2019d invite different friends to join in and the show became something we planned on whenever we were home from tour for a few days. Back then we were touring almost year round, three weeks on, one week off. The Family Hour show began as a chance to fly by the seat of our pants, play songs we simply liked to play, experiment with new, unfinished original material. It was a good excuse to learn cover songs we always loved, and most importantly to get together with other musician friends from the area, and say hey, we\u2019ve got this show, do you want to bring a couple of songs down? Play by yourself, play with us \u2013 whatever you want. In doing that, you get to work up songs with people, practice a little bit, or just wing it and enjoy being in the moment with whomever is on stage and these hundred people in the audience. \u201c It\u2019s also very natural for the Watkinses. As Sean explains, \u201cSara and I grew up in the bluegrass scene. People are traveling around, going to festivals. When they are not playing on stage, they are playing off stage around a campsite, at somebody\u2019s house or in a trailer somewhere. That\u2019s the mentality we grew up with; that felt normal.\u201d Being reared in the tradition of bluegrass and folk, continues Sara, \u201cit gave us this bug that craves this kind of reactive playing, that encourages improvisation and mixing up band members. In bluegrass and roots music, there is this wonderful cross-pollination that happens. It\u2019s very common for someone to be in two or three bands. And that strengthens the individual musician, keeps you on your toes, teaches you how to be a better leader in one situation and a supportive teammate when that\u2019s called for. I feel lucky to experience those different sides of being a musician, to have those kind of moments, those Family Hour moments, where it is always different, and you get to share the same space with musicians who are doing great things \u2013 to stand there in awe and try to contribute something special.\u201d As the Watkins Family Hour has become an established part of the Largo calendar, fitting nicely into the club\u2019s new space at the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, the show has evolved to where it truly can be taken on the road \u2013 and shared with Sara\u2019s and Sean\u2019s fans around the country. As Sara observes, \u201cIt\u2019s become a good blend of organized, planned, arranged harmonies and good quality moments on stage that we\u2019ve prepared\u2026 and some great surprises that happen when a guest just remembers a song they want to do or when somebody walks in the back door with their guitar and wants to play a song on a whim. Those moments make it special and that\u2019s the kind of thing we want to maintain when we bring the show to cities across the country. We are coming to towns where we have friends and we can have those moments, even if it\u2019s not our home club. It\u2019s the people on stage who make that happen; it\u2019s just a matter of getting the right group of people together. We are being thoughtful about where we are going on this tour so we can have that sort of flexibility. It will be a very different show in every town.\u201d Which means that we may all get a chance to be part of the family now. -- Michael Hill Watkins Family Hour is a monthly residency hosted by siblings Sean & Sara Watkins.

If intergalactic energy beings, upon their initiation into an order of whirling dervishes, built a pan-dimensional booty-shaking engine powered by psychedelic math...it would sound like a cut-rate CTS cover band. With their blend of progressive rock and improvisatory jazz, soaked in Indian and Middle Eastern styles, CTS blends disparate elements into an utterly original whole. A relentless touring schedule has earned them a fervent following around the world, with fans ranging from jam-band hippies to corpse-painted headbangers. Their latest album, You Are Literally a Metaphor, is the culmination of a fifteen-year musical journey. Packed with the same fury and dazzling virtuosity of their previous work, Metaphor is also a portrait of three musicians reaching new levels of maturity. From the bluesy swing of \u201cWhen You\u2019ve Loved and Lost Like Frankie Has\u201d to the ethereal electro-synths of \u201cSketches From a Blind Man\u201d, CTS\u2019s minimalist pop instincts stand shoulder-to-shoulder with progressive metal and freewheeling improvisation in a true expression of their omnivorous musicality. Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become. CTS retain their signature fiery maximalism while pushing the hooky, anthemic songwriting to the forefront. Bassist John Ferrara\u2019s new Taurus bass pedals and guitarist Gabriel Marin\u2019s new custom Vigier double-neck guitar add new dimensions to the band\u2019s already diverse sound. This is an album born of comfort and growth. In the five years since World War Trio, the band has toured extensively, Marin and Ferrara have released side projects, and drummer/percussionist Jeff Mann has gone from a relative newcomer to a road-hardened veteran. After all this time, CTS knows how to create space for each other, how to finish each other\u2019s musical thoughts and sentences, how to think as three individuals but speak with one voice. You Are Literally a Metaphor is a statement of confidence, an assertion of identity from a band with no reservations and nothing to prove. CTS have performed in a half-dozen countries across three continents. They have shared the stage with a wide variety of artists, including: Victor Wooten, King Crimson Projekt, Wyclef Jean, Ozric Tentacles, Soulive, The Disco Biscuits, Papadosio, Turkuaz, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Wayne Krantz and many others. They have performed at festivals and events including: Electric Forest, Peach Fest, Gathering of the Vibes, Resonance, Summercamp, Shakori Hills, ProgDay, and Progtober.

This eight piece musical outfit, with full horn section, was notorious for performing musical compositions ranging from Tower of Power, Sly and the Family Stone esq. to the likes of Funkadelic. Deep Banana Blackout has sold out such venues as the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut (1200 capacity) and Irving Plaza in New York City (1100 capacity). In 2001, DBB played a co-bill with Maceo Parker in the new Denver Fillmore to 2750 fans, was featured at such festivals as JVC Jazz Newport, Jazz Aspen/Snowmass, and Gathering of the Vibes, toured with the Allman Brothers Band, and performed in Japan as well. Because the band was reluctant to sign with a large record label, fearing that artistic expression would be undermind by terms and conditions stated within a contract, they disbanded in 2003 due to financial reasons. All four DBB albums were locally produced and distributed, with Live in the Thousand Islands selling well over 5,000 copies. In March 2005 and 2006, DBB played reunion-style shows to celebrate St. Patrick's Day weekend. Most recently, the band played at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, where a home-town prescents was felt- seeing as the majority of the band members are from Fairfield, Bridgeport, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Nunca pens\u00f3 en ser m\u00fasico, m\u00e1s bien prefer\u00eda imaginarse economista, como su padre. De hecho, hizo cuatro semestres en Econom\u00eda, pero la cosa definitivamente no iba por ah\u00ed. La m\u00fasica ya lo hab\u00eda atenazado desde que un compa\u00f1ero del colegio le propuso ser parte de la banda de rock que ten\u00eda junto con sus hermanos. La banda se llamaba Tercer Mundo. Ese fue el comienzo. Diez a\u00f1os de giras enloquecidas, fan\u00e1ticas adolescentes al borde de la histeria, camisas ra\u00eddas y mil historias compartidas en el camino, fueron suficientes y le llevaron a decidir buscar su propio camino, solo. As\u00ed comenz\u00f3 a hilvanar su primer \u00e1lbum: Para que no me olvides . Clasific\u00f3 al Cuadrag\u00e9simo Festival de Vi\u00f1a del Mar (1999) precisamente con la canci\u00f3n que le dio nombre a este \u00e1lbum y que tuvo gran acogida en su pa\u00eds, logrando Disco de Oro por ventas y situ\u00e1ndose en los primeros lugares de popularidad. Cuando empezaba a pensar en su siguiente trabajo, Para que no me olvides se filtr\u00f3 en Colombia y se volvi\u00f3 un \u00e9xito, logrando esta vez Disco de Platino y renombre internacional. A partir de all\u00ed se iniciar\u00eda una fuerte relaci\u00f3n del cantautor con Colombia. En el 2002 public\u00f3 su segundo \u00e1lbum, Tanto Amor , que muestra a Juan Fernando Velasco como un m\u00fasico y productor creativo, capaz de imprimir matices y propuestas musicales innovadoras en cada canci\u00f3n. Chao Lola , Dicen , Hoy que no est\u00e1s , Si alguna vez te am\u00e9 y Salud se ubican en los primeros lugares en las listas de popularidad en los pa\u00edses en los que se hab\u00eda publicado este segundo \u00e1lbum (Ecuador, Colombia, Panam\u00e1, Guatemala y Costa Rica), logrando nuevamente Disco de Platino en Colombia y en Ecuador. Aqu\u00ed se inicia una extensa gira de conciertos masivos con localidades agotadas en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, confirmando que Velasco no s\u00f3lo vende, sino que es capaz de atrapar a audiencias muy diversas que encuentran en \u00e9l y en su m\u00fasica una propuesta novedosa, seria y genuina. En el 2006 Juan Fernando realiz\u00f3 varias presentaciones importantes, entre ellas, la realizada junto a Franco de Vita en el Madison Square Garden de la ciudad de Nueva York en Febrero pasado. Adem\u00e1s de estos logros profesionales, su lado humano y su compromiso social son reconocidos con diferentes condecoraciones y nombramientos. Entre ellos, los dos m\u00e1s importantes: la Orden Vicente Rocafuerte (2004), m\u00e1ximo reconocimiento que entrega el Congreso del Ecuador al M\u00e9rito Art\u00edstico, y la designaci\u00f3n como Embajador de la Paz y la Ternura (2004) por parte de la Plataforma Interamericana de Derechos Humanos.
