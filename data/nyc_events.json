However, music was always there for her and she began making up songs for her son.  Once her second son was born in 2005, the living room became her stage.  It was there where she wrote \"The Run Song\" for her toddlers, which became a fun song asking her boys to walk really slow in a circle while anticipating when they could run, run, run, run, fast in the circle. They loved it!        As time marched on, Kim's desire to perform her original music turned into four albums released over a nine-year period while raising the boys.  In addition, she launched several library programs for adults and children in her area, and the children's sing along program became the last one standing when library funding encountered challenges related to the economy.  Over the years, Kim developed an understanding on how to perform for kids and what music they love.  She resurrected \"The Run Song\" and composed a new song called \"The Shaker Egg Song\" and off she went to sing for children as \u201cMiss Kim\u201d for local library programs.      When coronavirus hit in March of 2020, Kim knew it was time to finally do a children's album.   Not only did she pen eleven great energetic songs, but she was super excited to embrace some great moral messages like dealing with emotions in \"Colors of a Rainbow,\" working on getting better at doing things like walking or catching a ball in \"If You Want To Be Great,\" along with the very catchy, \"Being Kind.\" Both of her sons, now teenagers, have contributed musically to the album, and Miss Kim has released her first album \"Growing Up Great\" and two animated videos in October of 2020.

Not content to sit on the legacy they so passionately protect, LPJ and the band are taking a page from his father\u2019s playbook, by wailing \u201cPrima-Style\u201d for the future. Less concerned about reliving the past than about creating a future for it, Louis Prima Jr and the Witnesses bring new energy and a current attitude to the masses with The Wildest Show this side of the 1960\u2019s. Since their breakout performance at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (aka Jazz Fest), #TeamPrima has performed everywhere from Seattle to Palermo, from small clubs to performing arts centers, from casino showrooms to music festivals, and from Access Hollywood Live to PBS. LPJ and the Band are currently touring in support of their second Warrior Records/Universal Music Distribution (warriorrecords.com) release, BLOW \u2013 a collection of original music (save for a couple of surprises) as eclectic and unique as each member of this powerhouse band. Building off of the success of their critically acclaimed debut CD Return of the Wildest!, the band has brought together many years of diverse musical tastes into their second offering. From the first thunderous stomps of the title track, it is evident that this isn\u2019t your daddy\u2019s swing music, but a raucous roller coaster ride of tail-shakin\u2019, foot-stampin\u2019, horn-driven smiles. If you\u2019ve seen them in concert, you\u2019ll know a bit about what to expect from the musical minds of the Witnesses. As energetic and over-the-top as their live shows, BLOW continues the ever-changing musical journey that Prima Sr. began in the 30s. \"With the band\u2019s collective talents and diverse musical tastes, we wind up with a sound unique to this band, while staying true to the boisterous Prima style,\u201d says Louis. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to simply write music we thought the fans wanted to hear. We wanted to challenge ourselves musically and also challenge the listener. You can\u2019t fool the fans by trying to force the word \u2018daddy-o\u2019 into every song. If music does not come honestly from your soul, it will ultimately be short lived.\u201d Recorded at Capitol Records in Studio B, where Prima Sr. recorded his hits of the 50s and 60s, the seriousness of this music is masked only by the obvious fun that was had making it. It\u2019s been 50 years since legendary Prima music shook the walls of Capitol. A new legend is being born, and it will BLOW you away!

Sounds pretty scary -- but for Chris Pinnella it's the stuff of natural habitat; an environment that the versatile vocalist has thrived in, whether performing with symphony orchestras around the country, leading his own combos of anywhere from 8 to 15 players, or (for several tours of North America and Europe) lending his finely honed skills to the prog-rock / crossover locomotive known as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. That association with the late Paul O'Neil's spectacularly scaled project netted the New Jersey native a platinum record for his contributions to 'The Lost Christmas Eve' tour, and a chance to perform for an audience of over 1 million people, during a particularly raucous New Year's Eve in Berlin. In the process the seasoned young performer - a singer whose influences run from the epic arias of Pavarotti, to the elegant jazz phrasings of Tony Bennett and the next generation concert hall mastery of Bocelli and Groban - built his brand as a bandleader through gigs at venues that range from big city nightspots to theatres across the United States such as The Algonquin Arts Theatre in New Jersey as well as Axelrod PAC, The Great Auditorium, The Pollack Theatre, Rahway PAC, The Newton Theatre, House of Independents, The Grunin Center for the Arts, McLoone's Supper Club and numerous Luxury Private, Charity, Fundraising Galas and Events throughout the country. He has also played such prestigious NYC venues as Birdland, The Rainbow Room, The Explorers Club, The Rose Theatre at Jazz! At Lincoln Center, The Cutting Room, and Feinstein's / 54 Below. Recently, Pinnella was tapped by American Young Voices, singing with the group as one of their guests vocalists alongside massive student choirs ranging from 3000-8000 young singers touring major arenas, including a sold out evening at The Prudential Center in Newark, NJ. Pinnella began his career professionally at the age of 16 after an audition for Maestro Fr. Alphonse Stephenson & the Orchestra of St. Peter performing with the orchestra on and off throughout his career. Chris went on to pursue music and received his degree from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. Post college he worked off-Broadway and regional theatre and had the opportunity to portray the title role of Simeon in the New Musical 'Simeon's Gift' which was co-written by icon Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton-Hamilton. Pinnella spent a month with Ms. Andrews and the 6-person cast at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, NY working side by side until the shows premiere. Pinnella also worked alongside Emmy, Oscar winning arranger Ian Fraser and the Tony nominated John Bucchino and Tony nominated director Marcia Milgrom Dodge (B'Way's Ragtime) on the project. Currently Chris is working on writing and arranging his debut EP which is set to drop in 2020. The 11-track debut will feature mostly original material as well as a re-worked covers, namely Pinnella's always requested version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' will be given an overhaul complete with gospel choir and full orchestra. Infusing elements of jazz, classical, alternative, rock, and pop, Pinnella has his sights set on making 2020 his best year yet. \"Pinnella has been compared to vocal superstars Josh Groban and Michael Buble, but there is no doubt about the fact that Pinnella has a style that is completely his own. Every time he takes the stage he proves that he's one of the strongest forces in the classical crossover realm. His strikingly rich baritone and stage presence are unmatched.\" Ticketmaster Genre breaking.

Born in Spanish Harlem and raised in the Bronx, Palmieri learned to play the piano at an early age, and at 13, he joined his uncle\u2019s orchestra, playing timbales. Palmieri\u2019s professional career as a pianist took off with various bands in the early 1950s including Eddie Forrester, Johnny Segui\u2019s, and the popular Tito Rodriguez Orchestra. In 1961, Palmieri formed his own band, La Perfecta, which featured an unconventional front line of trombones rather than the trumpets customary in Latin orchestras. This created an innovative sound that mixed American jazz into Afro-Caribbean rhythms, surprising critics and fans alike. Palmieri disbanded La Perfecta in 1968 to pursue different musical endeavors, though he would return to the band\u2019s music in the 2000s. Palmieri perfected his arranging skills in the 1970\u2019s releasing several impressive recordings that reflected his unorthodox approach to music. His unconventional style would once again surprise critics and fans with the 1970 release entitled \u201cHarlem River Drive.\u201d This recording was the first to merge what were categorized as \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cLatin\u201d music into a free-form sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz. In 1975, Palmieri won the first-ever Grammy for Best Latin Recording for The Sun of Latin Music (he\u2019s won nine Grammys altogether to date), including two for his influential recording with Tito Puente, Obra Maestra/Masterpiece. Recognizing Palmieri as an American icon, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington, DC, recorded two of Palmieri\u2019s performances for its archives in 1988. Because of Palmieri\u2019s proclivity for creating music in funk Latin style, Little Louie Vega invited him to record on Nuyorican Soul (1997), a release that became very popular in the house and underground music scenes. In addition to the Grammys, Palmieri has received numerous honors: Eubie Blake Award (1991); Most Exciting Latin Performance, presented by the BBC in London (2002); Yale University\u2019s Chubb Fellowship, usually reserved for international heads of state, but given to Palmieri in recognition of his work building communities through music (2002); Harlem Renaissance Award (2005); Jay McShann Lifetime Achievement Award (2008), induction into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame (2008). A year later, the Library of Congress added Palmieri\u2019s composition \u201cAzucar Pa\u2019 Ti\u201d to the National Recording Registry, which at the time only included 300 compositions documenting the history of all of recorded music history in the U.S. With his widely popular eight-and-a-half minute \u201cAzucar Pa\u2019 Ti\u201d Palmieri changed the format of the recording industry, breaking the three-and-a-half minute barrier imposed by the recording industry. In 2012, Palmieri continued to innovate, celebrating 75 years with new music included in the original score for a documentary co-directed by Bobbito Garcia called \u201cDoin it in the Park\u201d that explores the cultural influence of playground basketball on sports and music. Palmieri\u2019s music recorded for the documentary is the basis of his newest recording to be released later this year. This will be Eddie\u2019s first time recording his own new music since winning back-to-back Grammys in 2005 and 2006. In 2013, Eddie Palmieri was awarded the coveted Jazz Master award by the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA). The NEA Jazz Master award is the highest honor an American Jazz artist can receive.

(2) Francisco Jos\u00e9 Arc\u00e1ngel Ramos, flamenco singer. (2) Arcangel is also a hard rock/industrial metal band from 70's. More in depth: (1) Austin Santos, best known as Arcangel, was born in 1985, in the city of New York to Dominican & Puerto Rican parents. His mother moved to Puerto Rico in the early 80s to realize her dream of singing by joining a Merengue group known as Las Chicas del Can. Austin met a young man known in reggaeton as \"De La Ghetto\" and the two began working together. \"Arcangel & De La Ghetto\" although they are relatively new artists, have done well so far with hits like \"Agresivo\", \"Sorpresa\", and \"Mi Fan\u00e1tica\". They gained fame relatively quickly. Many people who have been listening to reggaeton since its beginnings in the early 90's criticize the duo, particularily Arcangel for being \"cocky\" and trying to engage older more established reggaeton stars in rap battles. Other people argue that his attitude is warranted because the duo is well known without having released their own album. A recent tiraera (rap battle) occured with another duo, Jowell & Randy. You can check out some videos of them talking about each other on Youtube! (2) Francisco Jos\u00e9 Arc\u00e1ngel Ramos (Huelva, 1977) is a Spanish Flamenco singer formerly known as Arcangel. He began in 1987, but he is not well known until 1998 with his participation in X Bienal de Flamenco de Sevilla. From this moment, Arcangel sing for dance to famous dancers like Javier Bar\u00f3n, Eva Yerbabuena or Israel Galv\u00e1n and he also work with Vicente Amigo, actually one of the best guitar players. His first solo album was entitled Arcangel (2001). With this album, Arcangel won several regional and national prizes, like Premio Andaluc\u00eda Joven 2002, Premio Nacional Flamenco Activo de \u00dabeda or Premio Giraldillo.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Whether sharing lead vocals and instrumental solos or blending their voices into loose, joyous harmony, the four members of Damn Tall Buildings (guitarist/lead vocalist Max Capistran, bassist/lead vocalist Sasha Dubyk, fiddler/vocalist Avery Ballotta and banjoist/vocalist Jordan Alleman) blend elements of bluegrass, blues, roots-rock and vintage swing to create a captivating, high-energy sound. Since their busking days, they\u2019ve made three albums: 2014\u2019s Cure-All, 2015\u2019s self-titled, and their forthcoming third album, Don\u2019t Look Down. The band has also relocated to Brooklyn, NY and toured widely, sharing stages with Sierra Hull and the California Honeydrops and appearing at festivals like Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, and Freshgrass Festival, where they took second place in the 2016 band competition. Their lyrics find beauty and glory in the mundane, workaday struggle of everyday life: time keeps passing, you don\u2019t like your job, you drink too much, you laugh with your friends, you search for a home, and you dream about what else might be out there. You carry on. This is what Damn Tall Buildings sings about, what they seek to share with their audience.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "356 Broad Street , Summit, NJ 07901", "Artist": "Super Trans Am ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11460502.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.715839, -74.35764759999999], "Date": "2021-07-20", "EventDate": "Jul. 20th, 2021", "Genre": "Seventies Pop, Seventies Rock Music, Seventies", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "SUMMIT HOT SUMMER CONCERTS @ VILLAGE GREEN", "moreBioInfo": "Roll down your windows, crank up the radio, and take a ride in a Super Trans Am.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years. Cipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic. Cipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world. After being a student at the UCB theatre for over two years, Cipha now has a weekly sold out \u201cTake It Personal: Hip Hop Improv Show, where a different Hip Hop celebrity tells a true life story and Cipha & his team of improvisers perform a complete live comedy show based on those stories.

At age 16, he took on an endless internal journey rooted in mindfulness and catharsis. As he churned out 150+ songs each year, creativity became less possessive. As more songs would pass through him, he saw them not as his own, but small morsels of magic filtered through him. By the time Orchard began to tour around the US at age 19 under the moniker Littleboybigheadonbike, he had self released literally one hundred collections of songs on bandcamp. Mostly self produced, these releases were often experimental, and favored collage-like storytelling. Following a long spree of DIY touring in 2017-2018, Orchard took a few months of reflection to rethink his methods of creating. Renaming the project as simply Will Orchard, he emerges with a concise, vulnerable record titled Old Friends on the Mountain. Having found a new sense of truth in Americana sensibilities, he self recorded 8 songs in various living spaces around New England, often peppering the arrangements with sparkly but subdued electronics. Proceeding to work with engineer Jeff Prystowsky (The Low Anthem), the record was mixed in 2 days in Providence, RI. Old Friends on the Mountain is entwined with longing: for lost imagination, friends long gone, and memories slipping away. Each listen reveals more depth on a sonic and emotional level. The record pays tribute to the quiet, unsung moments we have with ourselves - moments that help us embrace the people we truly are.", "otherInfo": "Bobby Lewis x Mercury East present...

Having grown up in six different countries, his career has been shaped by a mixture of influences. Saran\u2019s intricate compositions fuse sounds from modern jazz, neo-soul, and rock with classical and contemporary Indian music. On February 10, 2020, Shubh Saran will release his latest EP titled Becoming. Becoming is the third release for Saran, who made his full length debut in 2017 with the release of Hmayra, and followed up in 2018 with the release of H.A.D.D. On Becoming, Saran explores past musical influences from a late 1990s and early 2000s punk rock era, while applying modern jazz techniques to the compositions. The five-song collection of original music was written and produced by Saran, and recorded with his seven-piece band over the course of a year between Studio G in Brooklyn and his home studio, also in Brooklyn. For Saran, Becoming is very much a revisiting of the music that formulated his early years growing up, and a reflection on how that music might sound today when infused with his current styles of producing. \u201cThe general concept was to explore what it would be like if I made the kind of music that I used to listen to, except in the ways I make music now,\u201d says Saran. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a modern jazz musician\u2019s approach to playing punk rock.\u201d Taking a moment in time to explore the music of his past has had a resonating effect on Saran. Studying music in academic settings and applying the principles of modern jazz composition have been important for Saran in growing as an artist, but working to simplify song structure and focusing on the right amount of information to transmit to the listener has been an important challenge in this chapter of his career. When considering audiences during writing sessions, Saran has worked to keep in mind how much he wants to disclose musically, and how much he wants to be left imagined by the listener. \u201cBecoming points in the direction that I want to go in, or at least where I want to explore right now, jumping between genres while still retaining the elements that have always made up my music,\u201d says Saran. When rediscovering the music of his younger self, Saran found that there were many tastes that evolved over the years, but still some that remained true. \u201cWhat was interesting about relistening to that music was noticing how much my musical tastes have changed over the years, while observing how similar some things still are,\u201d says Saran. \u201cCapturing the energy and the intensity of punk rock music, that seems on the surface loud and angry, I found, had this beautiful quality to it.\u201d Shubh Saran is a multi-dimensional artist whose vision of an ideal career is one that has an evolutionary musical arc to it. Continually innovating, finding new ways of uncovering melody and harmony, and channeling his true self, are all key components that make up Saran\u2019s identity as a musician and producer. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked artists who have long music careers, where their first album is really different from their last album, and you can see the evolution and influences over time,\u201d says Saran. \u201cI think this EP is very much about embracing what I was influenced by and how that has shaped my songwriting, so I\u2019m just celebrating that by being who I am as a musician.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Adam Neely, Shubh Saran, Josh Bailey"}, {"Address": "677 South Ave, New Canaan, CT 06840", "Artist": "Doug Allen Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9739230.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.1214317, -73.49032770000001], "Date": "2021-07-21", "EventDate": "Jul. 21st, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Waveny Summer Concert Series", "moreBioInfo": "Meet Doug Allen \u2026 Doug is a Nashville based singer-songwriter who is quickly becoming known for his high energy, acoustic shows and rich voice.

While the origins of Witch Taint remain hazy, even to the members themselves, there is at least some evidence of the band\u2019s existence dating back as far as late 2004, when Witch Taint founder Lance the King of Black Metal and About 500 Other Things Most People Can\u2019t Handle (rumored to actually be comedian and musician Dave Hill) began emailing a mysterious man name Saittham, managing director of a Norwegian Black Metal record label in Oslo called Planet Satan Revolution, in hopes of securing a record contract (Read their legendary, full and 100% real email correspondence for yourself at www.theblackmetaldialogues.com) despite the fact that he had yet to record any music. However, we also know a version of the band consisting of Lance and his sworn enemy, Oslo native Matthias Backwards (rumored to actually be musician and comedian Phil Costello), began performing live as a duo in 2017, reading the aforementioned emails and playing a select few songs during sold out appearances at SXSW, in London and Oslo (where none other than Fenriz from Norwegian Black Metal legends Darkthrone was in the front row), and at the 2018 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany. These shows were awesome and a lot of members of the audience had to receive counseling both during and immediately following the show because it was so extreme, brutal, and occasionally foul in odor. Anyway, after noticing the largely German-speaking audience at Wacken seemed to prefer their music over their talking, Lance and Matthias began recording the full-length debut Witch Taint album in earnest as soon as they got back to America. By this time, interest in Witch Taint had grown so much that none other than author Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, etc.) dedicated an entire episode of his Revisionist History and Broken Record to the Witch Taint story. This past spring, Witch Taint began performing as a full, six-member live band (consisting mostly of members found in the darkest recesses of Craigslist) that is so extreme, brutal, grim, unholy, kvlt, and just sort of negative in general that most people can\u2019t even handle it basically even if everyone agrees the Witch Taint T-shirts are pretty awesome and they should really consider keeping more mediums in stock but whatever. The band\u2019s full-length debut Sons of Midwestern Darkness, recorded entirely in darkness in a damp room that was also annoyingly cold even if you wore a coat and a hat and stuff the whole time, is set to be released by New York City\u2019s Tee Pee Records in early 2020. The album is extremely difficult to listen to in all the best ways and features guest appearances from members of such not-nearly-as-extreme-as-Witch Taint bands as Venom, Carpathian Forest, and Autopsy and also Lance\u2019s dog Lucifuge because they forgot to keep the basement door shut even though she will end up coming down there every single time no matter what. Sons of Midwestern Darkness is a twelve-song collection of extremely grim yet very catchy and danceable heavy metal anthems that are perfect to get hammered and sing along to with all your closest friends and enemies. There are also five extremely extreme interludes where Lance and Matthias Backwards basically school motherfuckers on various topics, which is awesome. If you think you can handle it, which- statistically speaking anyway- you probably can\u2019t, please get yourself a copy. And by all means, come see the band live (where Lance and Matthias will be joined by the destructive tendencies of opera diva La Sinistra, bassist Dean Ripper, guitarist Thomas Guillotine, and drummist Markus St. Bastard).However, whether you decide to kill yourself, go sit in a ditch for a while, or simply stare of into the distance for a disturbingly long amount of time as a result of having done either one of these things, that is not Witch Taint\u2019s f$cking problem.

Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019.

Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening.

I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school.

After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC.

Tragedy takes your favorite Bee Gees, disco and soft-rock classics and reinvents them in a Heavy Metal fashion. The result is aural ecstasy. You may enter the Tragedy experience unaware of your latent appreciation for gooey soft rock or flamboyant metal, but you shall emerge forever humbled by the greatness of Tragedy (and covered in glitter!). Born out of the impenetrable divide of Disco and Metal, these fearsome brothers fearlessly obliterated the truce line that had been set in the great Disco/Metal Peace accord of 1977 when they seamlessly blended the two genres with their debut album, We Rock Sweet Balls and Can Do No Wrong - a collection of Bee Gees songs redone in a heavy metal treatment reminiscent of Judas Priest, Motley Crue and Guns N Roses. Since then, they have crisscrossed the globe with their spectacular live shows, storming across the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland. On subsequent full length albums, Humbled By Our Greatness, Death To False Disco Metal, The Solo Albums, The Joy of Sex, Tragedy Goes to the Movies and #1 Christmas Holiday Party Mix, Tragedy spread their glittered wings to take on non-Bee Gees classics from the disco era, soft rock anthems and party jams. In 2015, Tragedy broke the internet with a viral video featuring their take on You're the One That I Want from the Grease soundtrack. In 2017, Tragedy's video for Stayin' Alive broke the internet once again. In 2019 two albums hit the NACC Heavy Top 30 charts. In 2021, Tragedy signed a worldwide record deal with Napalm Records. The first album with Napalm is Disco Balls to the Wall - release date July 30, 2021. Tragedy takes disco, soft-rock and pop classics, and completely reimagines them as glorious, red-hot heavy metal. Their music is sure to get your head bangin\u2019, your booty shakin\u2019 - and put a smile on your face and your fist in the air. Tragedy's concept, while subversive and humorous, goes well beyond what others have done in satirical music - they celebrate the soul of the original song, even while turning the soundscape on its head. The amps are cranked to eleven, but the emotion is not lost. You discover new meaning in songs that have been a part of your life for as long as you can remember. You laugh and cry. Dance and mosh. And feel newly connected to the disco-metal that was inside you all along. Tragedy does not lazily rely on the concept or \"the joke\". The band plunges deep - blazing musicianship, tantalizing riffs and stunning vocals. All except for Lance the towelboy. He's just an idiot. Also uniquely \"Tragedy\" is that they are the only \"vocal group\" to exist in heavy metal. Everyone in the band sings - trading off lead vocals and creating lush harmonies. It's as if they're the Bee Gees of hair metal. Or the Eagles of...LIFE metal! Tragedy consistently tours North America, UK & continental Europe, and has headlined festival stages of events such as SXSW (USA), CMJ (USA), Musikfest (USA), Bloodstock (UK), Rebellion (UK), Summer Breeze (Germany), Foudrock (France), Motocultor (France), ParkPop (Belgium), Glastonbudget (UK), Legends of Rock (UK), Belladrum (UK) and Hammerfest/Hard Rock Hell (UK). Bruce Dickinson, Iron Maiden \"Tragedy rocks sweet balls and can do no wrong! They are great fun!\" All About the Rock \"Far from being a novelty act, these guys are GENIUS. If they don't put a smile on your face, you must be dead inside\" Metal Hammer \"Camp as a row of tents, and with more hooks than hell's cloakroom, Tragedy guarantee it.\" Tiny Mix Tapes \"Tragedy manage to dwell in the realm of novelty while far exceeding their worth as a concept...the aesthetic is somewhere in between the flamboyance of the disco-era Bee Gees and the flamboyance of mid-eighties hair metal, with some extra flamboyance thrown in for the sake of flamboyance.\u201d The Sun, UK \u201cHard riffs, tight white flares, and even tighter octave-scraping harmonies...essential listening.\u201d Metal Rules \"The greatest heavy-metal-meets-disco party you could possibly wish for.\" Kerrang \u201cBack in the dark days of disco, the Bee Gees were the shit, despite having massive teeth, bigger hair and a falsetto only dogs could hear\u2026with the righteous power of heavy metal, We Rock Sweet Balls and Can Do No Wrong mixes Guns \u2018N\u2019 Roses swagger, the Scorpions\u2019 sense of pomp and Judas Priest-esque vocals to create a sound that is exactly like The Darkness!\u201d VH1 \u201cYou\u2019re the One That I Want\u201d Heavy Metal Tribute to \u2018Grease\u2019 is as great as it sounds. They created a music video for the cover, and it is exactly what you\u2019d think a heavy metal version of Grease would look like. Between the crazy outfits, wild hair, air guitars, and locker room parties, the only question left to ask is, why hasn\u2019t this idea been adapted into a full length movie yet? We want more!\" Loudwire \"One of the hottest videos. These kids aren\u2019t the leather jacket-wearing greasers from the \u201950s, but rather a modernized hard rock band of brothers attending the Our Lady of Perpetual Decimation high school. When the leader, Disco Mountain Man, arrives back in the halls, he\u2019s greeted by his buddies who ask him what he\u2019s been up to all summer. And much like Grease, it\u2019s revealed that he met up with a girl. But this is no poodle-skirt wearing young lady. Instead, it\u2019s an anarchy-loving blonde bombshell decked out in black and red. What follows is a re-imagined version of the song, with an ominous opening bass line and killer vocals from Mountain Man reminiscent of some of \u201980s metal.\" Billboard \"Decked in their hair-metal finest, with no can of Aqua-Net spared, Tragedy frolic on the beach, woo their ladies and then unleash their thrash chops in the most anarchistic pep rally this side of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" The result is hilarious and arguably even more heartwarming than the original, not least for the visual pun unleashed on the line 'it's electrifying.'\" Guitar World \"Tragedy: All Metal Tribute to the Bee Gees & Beyond has indeed pulled off a spot-on hair-metal spoof of the song, complete with a locker-room scene that takes place at Our Lady of Perpetual Decimation High School.\" USA Today \"A note-perfect hair-metal spoof of You\u2019re the One That I Want, complete with a locker scene set at Our Lady of Perpetual Decimation High School. Only instead of pony tails and poodle skirts, the girls have teased hair and tattered Hot Topic outfits.

It can be read as a children's show or a parody of a children's show. Much of the humor has a twist aimed at adults, in the style of Soupy Sales and Pee Wee Herman. The show featured character comedy, puppetry, some audience participation, musical guests, and Floyd's piano playing. One of Floyd's puppet sidekicks \u2013 actually a ventriloquial figure \u2013 was named Oogie. His on-air interaction with off-camera staff and sidekicks is somewhat in the style of what Howard Stern and Chelsea Handler would later do. Local bands such as The Smithereens, The Shades, and R. Stevie Moore, along with such well-known performers as The Ramones, Tiny Tim, Benny Bell, Bon Jovi, Jan and Dean, Peter Tork, Squeeze, David Johansen, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Joe Jackson, and Cyndi Lauper also appeared on Floyd's program. The show's first cast members in 1974 included Pat Cupo, and Marc Nathan, the cameraman. Later members were Scott Gordon, Craig \"Mugsy\" Calam, Richard \"Netto\" Cornetto, Jim Monaco, Art \"Looney Skip\" Rooney, Charlie Stoddard, David \"Artie Delmar\" Burd, and Clark the Wonder Dog. A phonograph album based on the show, The Uncle Floyd Show Album, was released on Mercury Records, and a number of 45 rpm singles on the Bioya label were released around 1979\u201383. Vivino has also released a few CDs as a solo artist. In 1982, The Uncle Floyd Show went into a small syndication circuit which included 17 markets, among them WNBC-TV channel 4 in New York, then WTAF-TV channel 29 in Philadelphia, WPWR-TV Channel 60 in Chicago and WSBK-TV Channel 38 in Boston. It aired right after SCTV on WNBC. The national syndication deal was seen as a huge step forward for the show, which up until that point could only be viewed in and around New Jersey and New York City on a single UHF channel and, at times, local cable. From 1983 to 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show ran on the statewide PBS network, NJN New Jersey Network, which consisted of 4 channels: WNJS (Channel 23, Camden), WNJN (Channel 50, Montclair), WNJB (Channel 58, New Brunswick) and WNJT (Channel 52, Trenton). Starting in late 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show was then seen on statewide cable channel CTN (\"The Cable Television Network Of New Jersey\").[2] During this time, the show went through various incarnations with Floyd sometimes hosting a music-only show, showcasing local bands. Floyd also hosted a show called Uncle Floyd's New Jersey, in which he would visit various towns and businesses in the state. First-run production of The Uncle Floyd Show ended in 1992, with CTN showing repeats until that channel's demise in 1999. In 1998, production of The Uncle Floyd Show began in the Cablevision studio in Oakland, New Jersey. One hundred shows were produced and aired on Cablevision systems throughout the region. Musical guests included Marky Ramone and The Misfits. Although viewer response was enthusiastic, the show was canceled by Cablevision management after the first cycle of episodes.", "otherInfo": "Join Uncle Floyd as he plays the piano and interacts with the audience and the Twin Door Tavern at the Maywood Inn in Maywood, NJ. \n\nEnjoy \"pianology\" at its finest, have some fine food and beverage, and experience a memorable evening with one of today's classic entertainers. \n\nReservations are recommended.

Just as comfortable on stage as he is behind the turntables, Cipha has carved out a distinct voice in music and comedy over the past 15 years. Cipha got his first break interning for Wildman Steve and DJ Riz of the Flip Squad. His tireless work ethic and perceptive DJ skills earned him opening slots at legendary NYC nightspots like the Tunnel and the Palladium. Soon after that, Cipha found himself spinning for Lil Kim, Mos Def and Jay-Z on national tours, and rocking private parties & album release galas for superstars like P. Diddy, Eminem and Mariah Carey. Most importantly, Cipha learned how to break new records, helping turn once-unknowns like Sean Paul, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Rihanna into superstars, and maintain a healthy sense of humor on the mic. Cipha\u2019s ear for talent and club-honed musical instincts also made him a natural A&R executive, a position he has held with labels ranging from Rawkus and Tommy Boy to the Neptunes\u2019 Star Trak imprint with Pharrell Williams, and Roc-A-Fella with Jay-Z. In 2003, he took an even bigger leap into the music industry and began hosting \u201cSucker Free\u201d and \u201cTRL\u201d on MTV. He has also set a goal to take over the Improv comedy world. After being a student at the UCB theatre for over two years, Cipha now has a weekly sold out \u201cTake It Personal: Hip Hop Improv Show, where a different Hip Hop celebrity tells a true life story and Cipha & his team of improvisers perform a complete live comedy show based on those stories.

Go home. \u201cHe said, \u2018Don\u2019t move. The way the music industry\u2019s going to become, you\u2019re not going to be able to get a record deal just doing a showcase anymore. You\u2019ve got to bring something to the table,\u2019\u201d Ray said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to you to go back to Florida, grab a band and become the biggest you can be in Florida on your own, and then I want you to come back.\u2019 So I put a band together of friends of mine and we started to play.\u201d Turns out it was the best thing Ray ever did. He built a rowdy fan base tilling the same fertile Southeastern soil Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan used to start their careers and returned to Nashville three years later to claim a record deal, a publishing contract and a few unexpected opportunities along the way. Ray continued the journey from tiny Eustis, Florida, to the big time with the release of his first single \u201cKiss You In The Morning.\u201d The debut single went #1 in just 24 weeks, an incredible achievement for anyone, let alone a straight out of the gate. Ray\u2019s follow-up single, \u201cReal Men Love Jesus,\u201d is currently climbing the charts and touching hearts at the same time. The touching ballad shows a different side to the artist, showcasing his true country roots. Scott Hendricks, Warner Music Nashville\u2019s executive vice president of A&R and Ray\u2019s producer, calls Ray \u201ccountry with an edge.\u201d \u201cMichael, he\u2019s got it all,\u201d said Hendricks, who is known for his work with Blake Shelton, Brooks & Dunn and Alan Jackson. \u201cHe sings well. He\u2019s a really seasoned entertainer. Girls find him not hard to look at. He\u2019s got the drive, the motivation, the work ethic, the right attitude going into this thing. He\u2019s been great to work with in the studio, just getting better and better every time we\u2019re recording. He takes it seriously, and we do have really high hopes for him.\u201d Something else Ray has? Authenticity. Raised in rural central Florida an hour from Orlando, but worlds away, Ray grew up hunting alligators and fishing for tarpon at the end of white sand dirt roads. The child of a family full of musicians, he began his professional career before he was a teenager, graduated to the bar scene as soon as he could drive and hasn\u2019t let up on the pedal since. \u201cWhen I was 9 years old I wanted to learn how to play. I started playing guitar with my grandfather. Two, three nights a week we\u2019d play community centers, Moose Lodges, assisted living homes, the VFW. I grew up with him on very, very old country music. I grew up playing Porter Wagoner, Bobby Bare, Earl Thomas Conley, Merle Haggard, Waylon- that was my first introduction to country music.\u201d Not long after, he went to his first big concert: Garth Brooks in Orlando. \u201cThat was one of the big things that changed everything to me,\u201d Ray said. \u201cThat was my visual of what I wanted to do.\u201d The show was the start of a chain of musical events that would help shape Ray\u2019s dynamic, muscular, thoroughly modern sound. \u201cI started watching everything Garth did. And Gary Allan came out with \u2018It Would Be You.\u2019 I started listening to my generation\u2019s country. And then I started listening to my generation\u2019s punk. And my generation\u2019s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, my generation\u2019s R&B, even a little bit of hip-hop. I could relate to all of this stuff.\u201d Ray started writing his own songs, blending the ragged spirit of those early favorites and the bombastic new sounds of modern country around the turn of the century with pleasing bits and pieces from all over the musical map. What emerges is a thoroughly modern sound that\u2019s sonically adventurous, lyrically diverse and over the top on the voltage meter. \u201cHe is all about energy, energy, energy, both in his music and how he presents it on stage,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t very many moments where you\u2019re going to have time to rest when you watch him, because there\u2019s a lot of energy he\u2019s putting out.\u201d He developed the approach in a grassroots way, plying club owners and promoters with press packets that included music, fun facts and a headshot. His pitch: \u201cDude, I\u2019ll play for free.\u201d He\u2019d stay glued to the riser four and five hours a night at the bar, armored with an acoustic guitar and a growing repertoire of original songs. He put together his first band after returning from that early trip to Nashville and got his first break playing the Boots N Buckles Saloon in Lakeland, Florida, opening for Jason Michael Carroll. A DJ who didn\u2019t give her name approached him after the set and took a CD with her. The next day a friend called to announce he was on the radio. That DJ turned out to be Sara Michaels of WPCV-97 Country and she started playing his music every day at 5:15 during the rush hour, \u201cRight between Kenny Chesney and Jason Aldean,\u201d Ray said with a smile. The next time he came back to Lakeland, he sold out the club as a headliner. Not long after he graduated to some of the largest regional clubs, selling out Orlando\u2019s House of Blues, for instance, during presale multiple times a year. He came to the conclusion he\u2019d hit the mark he was aiming for: \u201cThere was nothing else I could do there on my own. I didn\u2019t know how to take that next step.\u201d It was time to move to Nashville. He shared a small apartment with his band. He slept on the floor. The bass player got the couch and the keyboard player had the closet all to himself. Ray continued to spend about half his time on the road, traveling back and forth to the Deep South, and the work he was putting in began to pay off quickly. He soon met manager Tony Conway, a 40 year industry veteran and owner/CEO at Ontourage Management. Conway helped guide Ray to a publishing contract with Warner/Chappell Music and a record deal with Atlantic Records/Warner Music Nashville. Ray continues to grow his following, having recently toured with Chase Rice, Sam Hunt, Kip Moore, and early 2016 hitting the road with Brantley Gilbert. \u201cNow he\u2019s stretching the boundaries from state to state to state to stretch those fan bases,\u201d Hendricks said. \u201cSome guys kind of stop when they get here. This guy is a road warrior. He\u2019s out there all the time, playing wherever they will allow him to play to build his fan base. We just need to get those fans some food, some new music to have.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Michael Ray"}, {"Address": "147 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Oz Noy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8177331.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7284267, -73.999152], "Date": "2021-07-21", "EventDate": "Jul. 21st, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Oz Noy Trio", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cIt\u2019s Jazz. It just doesn\u2019t sound like it.\u201d This is how virtuoso guitarist Oz Noy describes his intoxicating blend of jazz, funk, rock, blues, and r&b. Born in Israel, Oz started his professional career at the age of 13 playing jazz, blues, pop and rock music. By age 16, he was playing with top Israeli musicians and artists. By age 24, he was one of the most established studio guitar players in the country. Oz was also a member of the house band on Israel\u2019s top-rated television show for more than two years. Since his 1996 arrival in New York, Oz has made a huge impact on the local and international music scene. His unique and intoxicating style has broken all the rules of instrumental guitar music by focusing on the groove. All stars such as Keith Carlock, Anton Fig, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Dave Weckl often contribute on drums, with bassists Will Lee, James Genus, and Reggie Washington. In 2003, Oz released his debut record \u2013 \u201cOz Live\u201d \u2013 recorded at NYC\u2019s legendary Bitter End. In 2004, Oz signed with Magna Carta Records and in 2005, released his highly-acclaimed studio record \u201cHA!\u201d with his all-star band featuring Fig, Carlock, Lee and Genus plus special guests Mike Stern and George Whitty. In April of 2007, a licensing deal with Magna Carta and Japanese label Videoarts opened the door for Oz's music in Japan. Later that year saw the release of \u201cFuzzy Feat,\u201d Oz\u2019s third record under the Magna Carta label. For Fuzzy Feat, Oz\u2019s all-star band is joined by various special guests including Colaiuta, bassist Jimmy Johnson, and keyboardists Whitty and Jim Beard. September 2009 saw the release of Oz\u2019s fourth album, \u201cSchizophrenic,\u201d featuring Lee, Fig, Carlock, Weckl, Ricky Peterson, Chris Palmero, and special guest Steve Lukather. November 2011 Oz released his fifth studio album \u201cTwisted Blues\u201d Featuring Vinnie Coliauta, Anton Fig, Chris Layton, Will Lee, Roscoe Beck , John Medeski, Jerry Z, Reese Wynans, Ralph Macdonald and special guests Eric Johnson & Allen Toussaint. In late 2012 Oz released his two highly acclaimed instructional DVD's,\"Guitar Improvisational Workout\" and \"Play Along Workout\", released by jazzheaven.com . For his accomplishments as a trend-setting guitarist, Oz won the highly acclaimed Guitar Player magazine readers poll for \u201cBest guitar riff on a record\u201d in 2007, \u201cBest new talent\u201d in 2008, and \"Best out there guitar player\" in 2013.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

Now he is launching a solo project that reimagines Sikh kirtan with boundary-defying Punjabi anthems to uplift & ignite. Sonny's first musical outlet as a child of immigrant parents in North Carolina was singing Sikh devotional music in gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship). His energy shifted to other types of music as he became a more serious musician: ska, reggae, funk, punk rock, bhangra, and more. In 2003, Sonny co-founded the political rock band Outernational and recorded an album produced by Tom Morello. As a singer and trumpet player, he has been central to the sound and raw energy of Red Baraat since the band's inception in 2008, touring globally and recording 5 studio albums. Sonny is currently finishing his debut solo album, produced by Wil-Dog Abers of Ozomatli, entitled Chardi Kala, the Sikh concept of revolutionary eternal optimism. His first single, Mitar Pyare Nu, premiered on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered and Rolling Stone India. Sonny\u2019s music is a reminder that hope, love, and devotion are crucial to our struggles and our collective survival. Chardi Kala is a return to Sonny\u2019s Punjabi & Sikh roots, but with the lens he\u2019s developed over the course of his life as a touring musician, educator, and activist. Musically, the project embodies the many spiritual, political, and aesthetic elements that have shaped Sonny: a bolero-mariachi Sikh shabad on one track, a qawwali song with a reggae bass line on another, a bombastic Ghadar Party tribute in Punjabi and Spanish on yet another.

As Poise, the New York City native is known for crafting dexterous melodies and emotionally-charged lyrics alongside propulsive rhythms and playful vocal arrangements. On debut album Vestiges, Murphy channels a devastating period of her life into a source of cathartic reprieve, transforming grief, bewilderment and uncertainty into a soundtrack for introspection and growth. It\u2019s an essential reminder that we have the power to trust ourselves and to come out stronger, even during our darkest, most difficult moments.  The catalyst for this chapter of Poise came with the sudden, unexpected death of Murphy\u2019s father. As a kid growing up in downtown Manhattan in the shadow of the punk rock scene her father came out of, Murphy was guided by his encyclopedic knowledge of music \u2013 everything from old blues and folk to Pavement and the Magnetic Fields. \u201cHe was always keeping an ear to the ground musically,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was open to everything and loved every genre.\u201d This unwavering curiosity and appreciation of the arts is something that Murphy strives to emulate every day. \u201cI only started playing guitar because he did, and my greatest wish is to share with him what I'm writing now.\u201d  During a long, difficult winter of grief, the start of a pandemic and the cancellation of her first ever tour with the Poise project, Murphy fought through the heartache and reemerged with a vigorous creative energy, propelling her artistic vision to a flourishing new terrain. \u201cI was devastated by all these things in conjunction with one another,\u201d Murphy explains. \u201cIt was a reminder of how delicate we all are as humans. I really felt like I needed to find myself again.\u201d  As the pandemic grew worse, Murphy left her apartment in Brooklyn and rented out a cabin in Vermont for the summer months. It was here that she established an artistic discipline that allowed her to play and experiment, away from the distractions of the normal every-day. She made more time to exercise and to meditate, which in turn gave her more stamina when it came to creative endeavours. \u201cI felt like this was the universe telling me that I have to write this album now. There really isn't time to wait,\u201d she says. With a consistent and focused writing practise, the album quickly came together within the space of three months. Armed with the song\u2019s blueprints, Murphy invited Sam Skinner and Theo Munger to collaborate on the arrangements. \u201cI really learned to trust my own ear and to trust myself as a curator,\u201d she says of the process. \u201cWhat I want is right for me.\u201d  The result is an album that honors the past while taking a tentative step forward, embracing new relationships, creative collaboration and the unknown. Vestiges is Murphy crafting her own voice and starting her story from scratch, the way she wants to see it written. \u201cA lot of this record is about finding confidence and learning to put myself back together when bad things happen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about coming out stronger, despite everything.\u201d Rousing opener \u201cWalked Through Fire\u201d sees Murphy craft a call-to arms to that past self, urging her to weather the storm through a blanket of aberrant synths, driving percussion and commanding vocals. It\u2019s here that she proves her abilities as an artist to herself, as well as her loved ones. \u201cSometimes you do need to psych yourself up in the mirror,\u201d she says.  Later, lethargic-banger \u201cShow Me Your Love\u201d sees Murphy confront those she felt she gave her all to and received nothing in return, while the guitar-driven \u201cNew Kind of Love\u201d tackles the complicated territory of trying to help a loved one escape an abusive relationship. \u201cPeople seem to think it's as easy as calling this abusive person out on the internet when that might actually endanger the person in the relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a friend, you can feel so powerless in those situations.\u201d Then there\u2019s the gorgeously throat-tightening, quiet ode to her father on title track \u201cVestiges,\u201d where Murphy mourns the loss of her future children\u2019s grandfather beneath a slow-burning, textural drone.  While Vestiges was crafted during the most heart-breakingly treacherous months in Murphy\u2019s life, it oozes with self-confidence, serenity and courage. It\u2019s an album that feels urgent, where songs are created not just out of sheer curiosity, but out of a deep, unrestricted necessity. Through a patchwork of meticulously-crafted textures, Vestiges ushers in a lustrous purging of agitation and anxiety, allowing Poise to prosper with a renewed authority that sees her celebrate life as much as she mourns the loss of it.

With unbridled emotional power, Troy has an inherent ability to reveal his pain and draw you into his music. This inimitable talent is brightly evident on his critically acclaimed debut EP, When the Lights Came, which features the haunting, introspective single, \u201cRosary.\u201d Though raised in a musical household, Troy considered other avenues, even accepting an academic scholarship to college. However, after tragically losing his father, Troy yearned for a fresh start and transferred to Boston College, where he was overheard singing at work by local musicians. He joined them for jam sessions and honed his craft, using music as a way to grieve. In the summer of 2013, Troy relocated to New York to advance his career in music, eventually joining forces with accomplished producer Dante Lattanzi of Caelum Music Production. Together, Troy and Dante have continually produced work that has been impressing industry leaders and garnering leagues of enthusiastic new fans.

In 2011 AM partnered with London based groove master Shawn Lee on a new full length entitled Celestial Electric. Recording the record in two separate cities (AM in Los Angeles and Shawn Lee in London) the response was almost unanimous that something special had happened with the collaboration. A sound Tiny Mix Tapes described as \" blurring funk, pop, and \u201cworld music\u201d genres beyond their established capabilities, yet remaining so true to a classic aesthetic that the album could be dug out of a crate without a label and confound listeners to pinpoint its origin.\u201d Upon hearing the album Thievery Corporation signed the band to their ESL label. The album also features the psychedelic artwork and superb liner notes of famed vinyl archeologist and B-music/Finders Keepers mogul Andy Votel. AM & Shawn Lee spent most of late 2011 and much of 2012 touring Celestial Electric including two US and European headlining runs, a support tour with Thievery Corporation and festival appearances worldwide including Seattle's Bumbershoot Festival, River's Edge Festival in St. Paul, MN, New York State Fair, Le Printemps De Bourges in France, and Motel Mozaique in Holand. The band was also invited to play Paris' ultra chic, David Lynch owned Club Silencio. The duo also managed to record the follow up to Celestial Electric in between touring demonstrating their seamless working relationship. The new album, entitled La Musique Numerique, is expected to be out May 7th, 2013.

Dion Francis DiMucci (b July 18, 1939), better known as Dion, is an American singer-songwriter, now widely recognized as one of the top singers of his era, blending the best elements of doo-wop, pop, and R&B styles. Early years Dion was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx borough of New York City. As a child, he used to accompany his father, a vaudeville entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of country music \u2013 particularly Hank Williams \u2013 and the blues and doo-wop stars he heard in local bars and on the radio. His singing abilities were honed on the street corners of Crotona Avenue, where he rounded up other local singers inventing acapella licks, and in local clubs. In early 1957 he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz, who had just formed Mohawk Records. They recorded him with a vocal group, The Timberlanes, and released a single \"The Chosen Few\", arranged by Hugo Montenegro, which became a minor regional hit. With the Belmonts, 1957-1960 Schwartz also signed up Dion's friends, The Belmonts, named after nearby Belmont Avenue. Their breakthrough together came in early 1958, when \"I Wonder Why\" made # 22 on the national US charts, followed up with \"No One Knows\" and \"Don\u2019t Pity Me\" which were also chart hits. This success won Dion and the Belmonts a place on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. On 2 February 1959, after playing at Clear Lake, Iowa, Dion decided that he could not afford the $36 cost of a flight to the next venue [1]. The plane crashed, and Holly and the other stars were killed. In March 1959, Dion and the Belmonts\u2019 next single, \"A Teenager In Love\", was released, making # 5 in the US pop charts and # 28 in the UK. Their biggest hit, \"Where or When\", was released in November 1959, and reached #3 on the US charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked in to hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful, there were musical and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960 Dion decided to quit for a solo career. Solo stardom, 1960-1964 1961 album coverBy the end of 1960, Dion had recorded and released his first solo album, Alone With Dion, and the single \"Lonely Teenager\", which rose to # 12 in the US charts. Follow-ups \"Havin\u2019 Fun\" and \"Kissin\u2019 Game\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with new vocal group the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \"Runaround Sue\", stormed up the charts, reaching # 1 in the US charts in September 1961, and # 11 in the UK, where he also toured. For the next single, the record company promoted the A-side, \"The Majestic\", but it was the B-side, Maresca\u2019s song \"The Wanderer\", which received the radio plays and again rose swiftly up the charts, reaching # 2 in the US charts in December 1961 and # 10 in the UK. As a classic oldie, it made the UK top twenty again in 1976. By the end of 1961, Dion was a major star, with a worldwide touring schedule, and he followed up with a string of hit singles \u2013 \"Lovers Who Wander\" (# 3), \"Little Diane\" (# 8), \"Love Came To Me\" (# 10) and \"Ruby Baby\" (# 2) all making the top ten in 1962. Several of these were written or co-written by Dion. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander. At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records, the first rock and roll artist ever signed to that label. Although the first single, Leiber and Stoller\u2019s \"Ruby Baby\", was a big hit, reaching # 2, several follow-ups were less so, although \"Donna the Prima Donna\" and \"Drip Drop\" both reached # 6 in the charts in late 1963. Nevertheless, problems with his addiction and changing public tastes did cause him to enter a period of commercial decline. Changing fortunes, 1964-1968 Following a European tour, Dion returned to the USA and was introduced to classic blues music by Columbia\u2019s John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon\u2019s \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"Spoonful\", but these releases \u2013 some produced by Tom Wilson, with Al Kooper on keyboards - were not commercially successful. In 1966, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts for the album Together Again on ABC Records. Again, this bombed, despite one classic self-penned song, \"My Girl The Month Of May\". Although by this stage Dion\u2019s career appeared to be nearing an end, he retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, the only pop artist featured on the album cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. In April 1968, Dion had a powerful religious experience. After getting clean from drug use, he approached Laurie Records for a new contract, and they agreed on condition that he record the song \"Abraham, Martin and John\", written by Dick Holler (also the writer of The Royal Guardsmen\u2019s \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\") in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy during the summer of 1968. The success of this song \u2013 later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye \u2013 which reached # 4 in the US charts, resuscitated Dion\u2019s career. The mature period, 1968-1986 Born To Be With You, 1975For the next few years, Dion\u2019s music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to critical acclaim but moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969. There followed a one-off live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden in 1972, released on album. This was followed in 1975 by the album Born To Be With You, eccentrically produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who. In 1978 Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, Return of the Wanderer, another critical success and commercial failure. In December 1979 he experienced a life-changing religious experience, documented in this article [1]. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian music vein, in which he released a number of albums on the Dayspring label reflecting his religious convictions. Recent work In 1987 Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. This helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences. In 1988 Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled The Wanderer: Dion's Story was published. In the following year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the induction speech being given by Lou Reed. In 1989 he returned to secular rock music with the album Yo Frankie, and since then has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His D\u00e9j\u00e0 Nu album in 2000 found him covering Bruce Springsteen, a major follower over the years. He joined Scott Kempner of the Del-Lords and Mike Mesaros of The Smithereens in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted. In January 2006 he released Bronx in Blue, an album of blues and country standards, which was critically acclaimed and nominated for a Grammy.

In 2000, Youth also took part in McCartney's similarly styled Liverpool Sound Collage.

The majority of the album's vocals come from McCartney. The duo borrowed the title \"Electric Arguments\" from the poem \"Kansas City to St. Louis\" by Allen Ginsberg.

The original members had played on hundreds of recording sessions before forming the band in 1964. They backed most of the vocalists in Jamaica at that time, including Bob Marley, Toots and The Maytals, Jimmy Cliff, Alton Ellis, Ken Boothe, and many more. After disbanding in 1965 the individual members continued playing in various groups as the music evolved from ska to rocksteady to reggae. In the late 70's a resurgence of interest in the music began in the U.K. which caused the creation of many bands such as The Specials, The English Beat, Madness, The Selecter and Bad Manners. This became known as the \"Two-Tone era\" and these British musicians fused rock music with the ska and reggae. In The early 80's the music started to spread to The U.S.A and other parts of the world and bands began to emerge everywhere playing different flavors of ska and reggae fused with whatever else they wanted to throw in, including hard core , jazz and even punk. In 1983 The Skatalites reunited to play Reggae Sunsplash in Montego Bay and subsequently in London at The Crystal Palace for the U.K version of The Sunsplash event. A few years later they began emigrating to the U.S.A and in 1986 the first US shows began at The Village Gate in NYC. In 1989 the band supported Bunny Wailer on The Liberation Tour and in 1990 they embarked on their first headline tour of The U.S.A. and have not stopped touring the world ever since. The band is available for festivals and also plays in intimate club settings. Their unique infectious brand of real Jamaican ska pleases audiences of all ages across the globe year after year. \"We hope you will enjoy listening to our music as much as we enjoy performing it for you.\" Forever indebted to the inspiration and talent of: Roland Alphonso, Lloyd Brevett, Tony DaCosta, Rupert Dillon , Don Drummond, Joseph \" Lord Tanamo\" Gordon, Jerome \"Jah Jerry\" Haynes, Lloyd Knibb, Tommy McCook, Donat Roy \"Jackie\" Mittoo, John \" Dizzy Johnny\" Moore, Jackie Opel, Doreen Shaffer, Lester Sterling.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "709 Lorimer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "The Oddysy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11220640.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7180854, -73.95025059999999], "Date": "2021-07-22", "EventDate": "Jul. 22nd, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Soul, Jazz, House, Funk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "SonicBids Presents Back To The Future", "moreBioInfo": "The Oddysy is a duo made up of Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee DJ Johnny Juice (Public Enemy) and NYC singer and jazz bassist KJ.
