His earliest exposure to music came at home, thanks to an extended family of musicians and ready access to a wealth of Colombian genres. By the age of 12, Torres was performing with various Bogot\u00e1 ensembles, developing techniques that allowed him to quickly adapt to the demands of jazz, pop music, and salsa. A classically trained percussionist, he earned a degree in Music Composition from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s esteemed Universidad Javeriana. \n\nBefore departing for the U.S. in 1999, the resourceful young artist had become an established figure on Colombia\u2019s fertile music scene, backing leading Colombian performers while serving as an arranger and music director for his country\u2019s highly regarded telenovelas (TV soap operas) and films.\n\nShortly after arriving in the U.S., his career took a dramatic turn when he was tapped by famed trumpet virtuoso Arturo Sandoval to join his group. Torres spent four years touring the world and recording with the jazz great, polishing his ever-expanding talents while attracting the attention of a long list of renowned artists with whom he would eventually collaborate. Over time, he would perform with a veritable \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the jazz, Latin pop, and salsa world, including such luminaries as Tito Puente, Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker, Don Byron, Claudio Roditi, Richard Bona, Poncho Sanchez, Lila Downs, Marc Anthony, Thal\u00eda, and his country\u2019s own international superstar, Shakira. His talents have also been featured in concerts with the Boston Pops, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Nashville Symphony and at a host of music festivals around the world.\n\nMore recently Torres was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Classical Album with the production \"Regreso,\" an incredible project done in collaboration with the Nueva Filarmon\u00eda of Bogot\u00e1."}, {"Address": "895 Bay Pkwy, Wantagh, NY 11793", "Artist": "Hall & Oates ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6351234.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6004596, -73.5061346], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Soul", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/101986719-hall-and-oates-at-northwell-health-at-jones-beach-theater?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Starting out as two devoted disciples of earlier soul greats, Daryl Hall & John Oates are soul survivors in their own right.

Signed to Atlantic by Ahmet Ertegun in the 1970\u2019s, Daryl Hall & John Oates have sold more albums than any other duo in music history. Their 1973 debut album, Abandoned Luncheonette, produced by Arif Mardin, yielded the Top 10 single, \u201cShe\u2019s Gone,\u201d which also went to #1 on the R&B charts when it was covered by Taveras. The duo recorded one more album with Atlantic, War Babies, (produced by Todd Rundgren) before they left and promptly signed to RCA. Their tenure at RCA would catapult the duo to international superstardom. From the mid-\u201970s to the mid-\u201980s, the duo would score six #1 singles, including \u201cRich Girl\u201d (also #1 R&B), \u201cKiss on My List,\u201d \u201cPrivate Eyes,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Go For That (No Can Do) (also #1 R&B), \u201cManeater\u201d and \u201cOut of Touch\u201d from their six consecutive multi-platinum albums\u2014\u201976\u2019s Bigger Than Both of Us, \u201980\u2019s Voices, \u201981\u2019s Private Eyes, \u201882\u2019s H2O, \u201883\u2019s Rock N Soul, Part I and \u201884\u2019s Big Bam Boom.

That same year, Daryl and John, participated in the historic \u201cWe Are the World\u201d session as well as closing the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. By 1987, the R.I.A.A. recognized Daryl Hall and John Oates as the NUMBER-ONE SELLING DUO in music history, a record they still hold today. On May 20, 2008, the duo was honored with the Icon Award during BMI\u2019s 56th annual Pop Awards. The award has previously gone to the Bee Gees, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Paul Simon, Brian Wilson, Willie Nelson, James Brown, Ray Davies, Carlos Santana and Dolly Parton.

Taking cues from artists like Counting Crows, Tom Petty, and Jason Isbell, he creates his own brand of Americana rock & roll. Hello, my name is Seth Adam. It is unconventional to offer a biography written in the first person. As the clich\u00e9 goes, rules were meant to be broken... I am a 44 year old singer-songwriter born and raised in Connecticut. I reside in the great city of New Haven with my wife and daughter. I\u2019ve been playing music, in one form or another, since I was 5 years old. I got my start playing in front of audiences when I was in the elementary school chorus. Rock & roll got a hold of me just before my teen years, and I performed my first \u201crock & roll band\u201d show at one of those old moose/elk/insert-animal-type halls when I was 14. I've been hooked on the rock & roll ever since. Here's the part where I tell you what I am currently doing with my career. 2016 was a turning point in my career as I wrote and recorded songs out of a hobbled together, home studio space. Playing all of the instruments, engineering, producing, and everything else-ing on my own resulted in an EP called East Rock. The experience inspired me to continue to do much of the same for the foreseeable future, foregoing using the formal recording studios. In January 2018, I released a single (and video) called \u2018Anytown,\u2019 written in response to the events in Charlottesville VA the summer before. Currently, I am writing and recording songs for a full-length album as well as wrapping up an all-acoustic version of my 2007 release, Where You Come From, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the original. On February 14th, 2020, I released a single called \u2018At Different Ends,\u2019 written about a year after the Presidential election of 2016. The song reflects on the division and loss of wonder in American society from the perspective of one lonely observer. Here's the part where I give you some history, drop some names, and tell you about some influences. I describe my music as singer-songwriter/Americana/folk/rock. That\u2019s a lot of sub genres, but probably the best way to characterize it. My earliest influences were Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Kenny Rogers. My dad used to play their records for me when I was a kid. Though the teenage years were my hair-metal, progressive-rock, and grunge phases, I find the music I write now to be the most heartfelt. My biggest influence is Counting Crows with Led Zeppelin coming in at a close second place. In recent years I\u2019ve come to nearly deify The Beatles and Son Volt. Ryan Adams, Jason Isbell, and Wilco have also been tremendous influences on my work. I love making music. It's how I make a living. It takes a lot of work and it pays off. In 2007, my song \u2018Get Out\u2019 was licensed to Volkswagen for their Sights & Sounds campaign. In 2008, then Fox entertainment columnist in NYC, Roger Friedman, called me \u201cthe hardest-working, best live act in indie rock.\u201d In 2010, I received a nice hometown nod from The New Haven Advocate\u2019s reader\u2019s poll, winning the Best Rock Band category. For my 2013 release, \u201cSteel Tempered Pride,\u201d I had the good fortune of working with David Immergl\u00fcck, guitarist for Counting Crows, James Maddock, and Camper Van Beethoven. In 2016 I was nominated for Male Performer of the Year for The New England Music Awards, and again in 2017 for Songwriter Of The Year. Through the years, I\u2019ve opened for Grammy-winning Steep Canyon Rangers, Grammy-winning Robert Cray, Tonic, Vertical Horizon, The Alternate Routes, Will Hoge, Gary Louris (The Jayhawks), Ken and Drew from Sister Hazel, Kyle Cook (Matchbox Twenty), and Mayer Hawthorne. I also like dogs. I think they're cool.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

The group formed in London in 1974. The two main writing partners in the band, Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, are widely considered to be among the finest melodic pop songwriters of their generation and have often been compared with the legendary Lennon-McCartney partnership, although unlike The Beatles, Difford and Tilbrook's direct collaboration on songs continued through most of the group's career. The original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland. Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike & The Mechanics as well as a solo artist. Since the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks. In 2007 Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain.

It can be read as a children's show or a parody of a children's show. Much of the humor has a twist aimed at adults, in the style of Soupy Sales and Pee Wee Herman. The show featured character comedy, puppetry, some audience participation, musical guests, and Floyd's piano playing. One of Floyd's puppet sidekicks \u2013 actually a ventriloquial figure \u2013 was named Oogie. His on-air interaction with off-camera staff and sidekicks is somewhat in the style of what Howard Stern and Chelsea Handler would later do. Local bands such as The Smithereens, The Shades, and R. Stevie Moore, along with such well-known performers as The Ramones, Tiny Tim, Benny Bell, Bon Jovi, Jan and Dean, Peter Tork, Squeeze, David Johansen, Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Joe Jackson, and Cyndi Lauper also appeared on Floyd's program. The show's first cast members in 1974 included Pat Cupo, and Marc Nathan, the cameraman. Later members were Scott Gordon, Craig \"Mugsy\" Calam, Richard \"Netto\" Cornetto, Jim Monaco, Art \"Looney Skip\" Rooney, Charlie Stoddard, David \"Artie Delmar\" Burd, and Clark the Wonder Dog. A phonograph album based on the show, The Uncle Floyd Show Album, was released on Mercury Records, and a number of 45 rpm singles on the Bioya label were released around 1979\u201383. Vivino has also released a few CDs as a solo artist. In 1982, The Uncle Floyd Show went into a small syndication circuit which included 17 markets, among them WNBC-TV channel 4 in New York, then WTAF-TV channel 29 in Philadelphia, WPWR-TV Channel 60 in Chicago and WSBK-TV Channel 38 in Boston. It aired right after SCTV on WNBC. The national syndication deal was seen as a huge step forward for the show, which up until that point could only be viewed in and around New Jersey and New York City on a single UHF channel and, at times, local cable. From 1983 to 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show ran on the statewide PBS network, NJN New Jersey Network, which consisted of 4 channels: WNJS (Channel 23, Camden), WNJN (Channel 50, Montclair), WNJB (Channel 58, New Brunswick) and WNJT (Channel 52, Trenton). Starting in late 1986, The Uncle Floyd Show was then seen on statewide cable channel CTN (\"The Cable Television Network Of New Jersey\").[2] During this time, the show went through various incarnations with Floyd sometimes hosting a music-only show, showcasing local bands. Floyd also hosted a show called Uncle Floyd's New Jersey, in which he would visit various towns and businesses in the state. First-run production of The Uncle Floyd Show ended in 1992, with CTN showing repeats until that channel's demise in 1999. In 1998, production of The Uncle Floyd Show began in the Cablevision studio in Oakland, New Jersey. One hundred shows were produced and aired on Cablevision systems throughout the region. Musical guests included Marky Ramone and The Misfits. Although viewer response was enthusiastic, the show was canceled by Cablevision management after the first cycle of episodes.", "otherInfo": "Join Uncle Floyd as he plays the piano and interacts with the audience and the Twin Door Tavern at the Maywood Inn in Maywood, NJ. \n\nEnjoy \"pianology\" at its finest, have some fine food and beverage, and experience a memorable evening with one of today's classic entertainers. \n\nReservations are recommended.

Lyon grew up in Ocean Grove, New Jersey and graduated from Neptune High School. As an artist, Southside Johnny first achieved prominence in the mid-1970s as the second act to emerge from the Jersey Shore music scene and be considered part of the Jersey Shore sound, following Bruce Springsteen. Southside's first three albums, I Don't Want to Go Home (1976), This Time It's For Real (1977), and Hearts of Stone (1978), were Stax-influenced R&B arranged and produced by the co-founder of the band and Springsteen confederate Steven Van Zandt and largely featured songs written by Van Zandt and/or Springsteen. The Van Zandt-written \"I Don't Want To Go Home\" became Southside's signature song, an evocative mixture of horn-based melodic riffs and sentimental lyrics. Other notable songs included \"The Fever\",\"Talk to Me,\" \"This Time It's For Real,\" \"Love on the Wrong Side of Town,\" and the definitive version of Springsteen's \" Hearts of Stone.\" Southside has long been considered the Grandfather of \"the New Jersey Sound.\" Jon bon Jovi has acknowledged Southside as \"his reason for singing.\" In 1982 the Rolling Stone Magazine voted the album Hearts of Stone among the top 100 albums of the 70's and 80's. Cast under Springsteen's long shadow, national commercial success eluded Southside and the Jukes, and in 1979 they were dropped by their record company. Now working without Van Zandt, they released The Jukes in 1979 and Love is a Sacrifice in 1980. Neither of these achieved much success either. The band's first official live release also came out in 1980, the double album Reach Up and Touch the Sky. During the 1980s Southside Johnny's recording contracts continued to change almost by album, but he continued to release records: Trash It Up (1983), a disco influenced album written by Billy Rush and produced by Nile Rodgers; In the Heat (1984) an album trying to reach out to \"Adult Oriented Radio\"; and At Least We Got Shoes (1986) where guitarist and Jersey shore fixture Bobby Bandiera, who often plays a custom guitar built by First Act Guitars took over songwriting and guitar work from Billy Rush and led the Asbury Jukes back to their original sound. Songwriting credits on At Least We Got Shoes also contain a song co-written by Bandiera and singer Patti Scialfa, who was known as a Jukes collaborator since the 1980 album Love is a Sacrifice and who became a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band in 1984. In 1988 Southside Johnny released his first solo record Slow Dance containing ballads and love songs, but also \"Little Calcutta\" which is still discussed as Southside's most political song of his career, describing the life and environment of the homeless in New York City. More record label switches, Jukes personnel changes, tours and club dates followed. His recording career was re-launched with the album Better Days (1991), which featured production by Van Zandt, songs by Springsteen, and vocal performances from Van Zandt, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. With Bobby Bandiera driving the band, the Jukes were gaining new energy for a world wide tour supporting the album. But once again, Southside Johnny's bad luck with the industry was shown when the record label went bankrupt while the tour was still rolling. Southside performed the theme song for the 1990s sitcom Dave's World, a cover of Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right.\" Southside eventually relocated to Nashville taking a break from the music business. A few members of the Asbury Jukes would end up being part of The Max Weinberg 7 on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien television show, while some others went on tour and into the recording studio with artists like Jon Bon Jovi, Mink DeVille, Graham Parker, Robert Cray. In 1998 Southside Johnny came back into the spotlight with an independent release titled Spittin' Fire, a live record with a semi-acoustic Jukes lineup released in France containing a 20 song set recorded during a series of 10 shows at the \"Chesterfield Caf\u00e9\" in Paris, France. After a decade without a record contract Southside finally founded his own record label in 2001 under the name of Leroy Records, and started releasing and distributing his new records fully under his own control: Messin' with the Blues (2000), Going to Jukesville (2002), Missing Pieces (2004), Into the Harbour (2005). Southside continues to perform, and maintains substantial audience followings in some regions of the U.S., such as New Jersey, New York, northeast Ohio, and abroad, in the UK and continental Europe, as 2002's Live At The Opera House DVD, filmed at a sell-out performance in Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrates. As of 2005, he resides on the Delaware Bay. His annual appearances at Springsteen's Asbury Park holiday shows draw as much crowd excitement as Springsteen himself.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Starr St, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Apollo Sunshine ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11605615.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7055861, -73.9223421], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Live Mixtape featuring members of Apollo Sunshine, !!!, Tycho and Okkervil River", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102794156-apollo-sunshine-at-the-sultan-room?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Shall Noise Upon, released on September 2nd, 2008 on the Headless Heroes label, is the third full-length album from Apollo Sunshine. Recorded during the summer of 2007 in the Catskill Mountains, in a house inhabited by spirits (and next door to the home of the original Uncle Sam), the album sees multi-instrumentalists Jesse Gallagher, Sam Cohen, and Jeremy Black weaving through a multitude of styles (psych-pop, groove-funk, cowboy songs, samba/tropicalia) with assured fluidity and inspiration. This is not a band searching for their sound; they have crafted an awesome mix of original material that celebrates the journey through darkness and light. Surrendering themselves to the collective head-space and transformative alchemy of Apollo Sunshine and with help from their friend and co-producer, Quentin Stoltzfus (Mazarin), Shall Noise Upon is an illumination of love in a world of \"dangers\"- real and false. The CinemaScopic arrangements on the album couldn\u2019t have been realized without recruiting a parade of musical friends including: Drug Rug, Edan, Tulsa, Viva Viva, and White Flight. The result is a timely collage of lush instrumentation: drawn from home-made samples and field-recordings to singing bowls and jaw harp. The sounds on Shall Noise Upon come together in an impressionist tour of electrified music. Album-openers \"Breeze\" and \"Singing To The Earth (To Thank Her For You)\", are love-poems to nature and longing, weaving the emotional connection to the world and to each other as one magnetic force, while building and bursting to the sound of cascading autoharp and drippy pedal-steel. \"666: The Coming Of The New World Government\" likens America today to the fall of Rome around anthemic psych guitar scrawl, propellant percussion, and winding vocal harmonies. \"Brotherhood Of Death\" is a brain-buster from the apocalypse that tells the hallucinatory tale of a man intoxicated by greed and power; followed by \"Happiness\", a gorgeous, expansive instrumental, which sounds like an orchestra conducted by Ray Davies. The band is already recreating the depth of these new studio recordings live. That may seem hard to pull off, but for anyone who's ever seen Apollo Sunshine, maniacally switching instruments, producing an extra-terrestrial sea of tones, this is where they shine the brightest. Over the last few years they've toured with Apples In Stereo, Dr. Dog, and They Might Be Giants, Toots and the Maytals and performed at Bonnaroo, Langerado, and Sasquatch. This Fall they will touring all over the US and UK. There is an impression you get from an amazing mix, where distinct parts add up to a unified feeling; and with each play, the range of sounds grow more connected to each other. It's these gifts, \"albums\" traded among friends that inspired Shall Noise Upon. It will have you believing in love, in a world both dangerous and beautiful.", "otherInfo": "Berlin based producer and sound Artist Jeremy Black, known for his eclectic live performances with members of DARKSIDE, Bon Iver, !!!, Efterklang and The Rapture, returns to the Sultan Room for a live curated audio visual mixtape featuring members of Apollo Sunshine, Tycho, !!!, Okkervil River and more"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Kerry Coddett ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7251094.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022613247-kerry-coddett-at-the-stand-(main-room)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "We're Not Banging! w/ Krystyna Hutchinson & Justin Silver!"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Krystyna Hutchinson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7678900.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Stand-up Comedy", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022487884-krystyna-hutchinson-at-the-stand-(main-room)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Krystyna is a stand-up comedian, writer and actress living in New York City.

He grew up playing bluegrass in that grand old tradition of staying up late & singing real loud. Although he\u2019s since moved north, the humid south remains, lodged in his heart and sinus cavities. Heralded as \u201ca leading light of the New York bluegrass scene\u201d by the New York Times, Michael Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, and others in addition to his solo performances. Daves\u2019 most recent project is a two-album set, Orchids and Violence, released February 2016 on Nonesuch Records. Both discs are produced by Daves and have identical track listing of mostly traditional bluegrass songs. The first features straightforward interpretations of them and was recorded live to tape in a 19th-century church by Daves and a band of roots-music innovators: bassist Mike Bub, violinist Brittany Haas, mandolinist Sarah Jarosz, and banjo player and Punch Brother Noam Pikelny. The second disc was recorded in Daves's home studio and includes bass, drums, and electric guitar, mostly played by Daves, and takes a raw, experimental rock approach to the same old-time material. \"The identical track listing makes for a good comparison study,\" says the New York Times music critic Nate Chinen in his review, \"and to his credit, it can be hard to pick which version of a tune is best.\" Daves previously recorded bluegrass standards on Sleep with One Eye Open, a duo session with mandolinist Chris Thile (Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek) which was done live to tape over four days at Jack White\u2019s Third Man studio in Nashville. The album is a collection of 16 traditional tunes by bluegrass legends like The Monroe Brothers, The Louvin Brothers, Jimmy Martin, and Flatt & Scruggs. The duo makes for \"a rip-roaring partnership,\" says the New York Times. \"Bluegrass, in their hands, gets roughed up in the best possible way, with skill and fervor, and a touch of abandon.\" \u201cSleep With One Eye Open\u201d received a 2011 Grammy Nomination for Best Bluegrass Album. Although he is best known as a roots musician, Daves gravitated toward experimental music and jazz while studying at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Relocating to Brooklyn more than a decade ago, he began to crave the social interaction and musical challenges of bluegrass: \"In Western Massachusetts, I was mostly doing jazz. By the time I moved to New York, I was ready to leave that behind, get back to my personal roots in bluegrass music. There were good jam sessions in New York and I was excited to reenter a regular jamming culture in the city. And I was getting back into rock music, too. The Brooklyn scene in 2003 and 2004 was pretty fertile. There was a lot of great, kind of raw, experimental rock music happening at that time, drawing me in, scratching an itch.\" Since 2006 Daves has maintained a weekly residency on Tuesday nights at The Rockwood Music Hall in Manhattan where he continues to draw a devout following, and uses the informal setting to showcase special guest appearances with a who\u2019s who of bluegrass musicians including Noam Pikelny, Chris Eldridge, Sarah Jarosz, and Aoife O\u2019Donovan. He is also an in-demand teacher and noted booster of NYC\u2019s thriving bluegrass music community.", "otherInfo": "Michael Daves Quartet (Hargreaves, Jake Jolliff & Alvar)"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Jacob Jolliff ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6347598.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223225, -73.98858129999999], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Bluegrass, Country", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall Stage 2 w/Michael Daves", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102726728-jacob-jolliff-at-rockwood-music-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "This is the artist page for the mandolin player, Jacob Jolliff.

Dean endured the ups-and-downs of music industry buffoonery before eventually landing onstage in America's toughest and most rewarding comedy clubs. Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"Mohr Stories,\" \"You Made it Weird\" and his own weekly podcast, \"Let There Be Talk,\" on the All Things Comedy network. Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hitmaker for Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys). Dean's comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience. His premises, punchlines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to a near Sam Kinison level of animation. As an actor, Delray can be seen in \"The Longshots\" (starring Ice Cube), \"Hellride\" (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino) and \"Maron\" on IFC.

Adding to his varied work with the Aaron Comess Trio, the Aaron Comess Quintet and the improvising collective the Air Conditioned Gypsies, Comess fronts a new and unique lineup for this recording, with the beguiling sound of Leon Gruenbaum\u2019s innovative samchillian\u2122 MIDI controller in the foreground. \u201cThe start of this music,\u201d Comess recalls, \u201cwas Leon and I doing a series of short improvisations with Roman Klun engineering in our studio \u2018his house-Innsbruck Studios\u2019 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I really love the sonic scope Leon gets on the samchillian\u2122, which he invented himself. He really is the secret weapon of this record.\u201d With its deconstructed computer-keyboard interface, the samchillian\u2122 (full name: \u201csamchillian tip tip tip cheepeeeee\u201d) summons an airy sound and a skewed, subtly pervasive harmonic world. It can access pitches in spiraling technical patterns that would be otherwise unplayable. It can execute 40-note-per-octave microtonal scales, overtone scales, spontaneously generated tone rows and many other things of Gruenbaum\u2019s devising. But underneath the sheer technological feat of it all, it\u2019s the instrument\u2019s depth of musicality and gorgeous evocative tone that comes across first and foremost. Comess and Gruenbaum had worked together before in Pat Daugherty\u2019s group New York Electric Piano as well as the Air Conditioned Gypsies. With Sculptures they begin a new collaborative chapter, evincing a deep and unpredictable chemistry. \u201cThe songs \u2018Sculptures,\u2019 \u2018Dogs\u2019 and \u2018Wacky\u2019 were products of our early improvised sessions,\u201d Comess continues. With the addition of Grey McMurray on electric guitar, Oli Rockberger on Fender Rhodes and John Davis on bass, the project came into focus, and what Comess calls a \u201ctriangular\u201d formal structure emerged. On one side were the raw rhythm-based pieces such as the title track; on another were the folk- or rock-like, acoustic guitar-driven songs \u201cBerlin\u201d and \u201cFalling Leaves,\u201d featuring Comess\u2019 highly effective (self-taught) acoustic guitar playing; on still another were the more elaborate, composed pieces such as \u201cSoundcheck-Oceans\u201d and \u201cThe Pink Room. \u201cI think \u2018The Beast\u2019 and \u2018Berlin Part Two\u2019 fall somewhere in between,\u201d Comess adds. It was the cover photograph of Sculptures, shot by Comess on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario, that took hold of his imagination as he began plotting out the album. \u201cThe image played a role in how I wanted the music to sound,\u201d he says. \u201cBased on the sculpture in that photo, I began to see the making of these songs as a kind of musical sculpture. The main goal was for everything to have a strong mood and color to it.\u201d Amid the enveloping sound of Gruenbaum\u2019s samchillian\u2122, the other players all proved equally indispensable. \u201cGrey\u2019s guitar playing was so intuitive,\u201d Comess remembers. \u201cI didn\u2019t have him hear anything before we hit \u2018record,\u2019 and in many cases the first thing he recorded was the one. I was blown away in particular by what he played on \u2018Sculptures\u2019 \u2014 the harmony moves around in odd places and he just opened his ears and moved with it effortlessly and added so much. After hearing that, I knew I wanted his contributions on the rest of the record.\u201d Comess and Rockberger played together for years with James Maddock, the gifted singer-songwriter who contributes guest wordless vocals on \u201cThe Pink Room.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve known Oli for about 10 years and he\u2019s one of my favorite musicians. He has a gift for playing complicated things that sound simple and really connecting with the listener. When Oli told me he was going to be in town a few days I booked a session around him. [Bassist] John Davis plays in Jojo Mayer\u2019s band Nerve; he and I had recently played together and hit it off really well, and I knew his sound and approach would be great for this music.\u201d From the intriguing rhythmic asymmetries of the opening title track and \u201cWacky,\u201d to the pumping dance groove energy of \u201cThe Beast,\u201d to the plaintive and melodic contours of \u201cBerlin\u201d and \u201cFalling Leaves,\u201d Comess brings his eclectic vision into being. His acoustic guitar on the latter two reflects the atmospheric and ethereal approach of his writing more broadly. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of guitar players and do most of my writing on acoustic guitar ,\u201d Comess reveals. \u201cBill Frisell and Daniel Lanois have had a massive influence on my music. I\u2019ve been using different tunings lately, and while spending three weeks in Berlin last year I was stuck on one in particular. I came up with a bunch of song ideas, one of which became \u2018Berlin.\u2019\u2019 Originally from Dallas, Texas, Comess is informed by a wide range of influences and playing experiences, not least his ongoing work as a founding member of the Grammy-nominated funk-rock band Spin Doctors, with a total of 10 million albums sold and over 1500 live shows under their belt with all four original members intact (in 2018 they mark their 30th year). Comess has also spent a decade-plus in the touring band of Joan Osborne, and in 2017 appeared on new releases by her, Rachael Yamagata, James Maddock, Willie Nile, Garland Jeffreys , Chris Bergson and German platinum-selling artist Marius Westerhagen to name a few . He has also worked with Bilal, Edie Brickell, Chris Whitley , Marc Cohen , Roswell Rudd, Ivan Neville, and a host of others. Active as a leader since his 2006 debut Catskills Cry (featuring Bill Dillon and Tony Levin), Comess has released three albums with his most active group, the Aaron Comess Trio (Beautiful Mistake, Blues for Use, Live 2016), featuring Teddy Kumpel and Richard Hammond; and a self-titled 2016 outing with the straightahead jazz-oriented Aaron Comess Quintet adding Keith Loftis and Barney McAll to the mix. Praised by Modern Drummer for his \u201cmusical approach to the kit, powerful stick work, and strong songwriting sense,\u201d Comess reaches new heights of invention on Sculptures.", "otherInfo": "Aaron Comess , Vernon Reid , Steven bernstein , Brad Mehldau , Leon Gruenbaum , Jonathan Maron"}, {"Address": "99 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Stand Up Comedy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7296283, -74.0010291], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Greenwich Village Comedy Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022215473-stand-up-comedy-at-greenwich-village-comedy-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "307 W 26th St, New York City, NY 10001", "Artist": "27 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/125275.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7476699, -73.9975237], "Date": "2021-08-11", "EventDate": "Aug. 11th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Electronic, Alternative, Trip Hop", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Asylum NYC", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022553418-27-at-asylum-nyc?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, they have released records on Hydra Head, Reproductive and Relapse in the US and Undergroove in the UK. 27, or sometimes twentyseven or even twenty27seven are Maria Christopher, Ayal Naor, Terri Christopher and Greg Moss.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC.

But such was the excitement generated by her clear, beautiful voice, strong songwriting ability, and live performances, all of which have drawn comparisons to younger, critically respected artists like Kelly Willis and legends such as Dolly Parton. Cook was born in Wildwood, FL. Her West Virginia-born mother played guitar and mandolin and sang on local radio shows. Her father, a Georgia native, also performed country music and served jail time for running moonshine. Upon his release, he and Elizabeth's mother played in local bands together, eventually marrying. Elizabeth, born in 1972, moved to Nashville in her twenties and quickly got a publishing deal. Demos recorded between 1997 and 2000 comprised her self-titled, independently released debut album, which showcased her formidable songwriting ability and featured such well-known Music City musicians as Tim Carroll, Kenny Vaughan, and Rick Schell. Atlantic Records signed Cook soon after its release, and she began working on her major-label debut.

For guitar virtuoso Albert Cummings, no words could ring more true. Cummings' masterful guitar wizardry has drawn comparisons to iconic axe legends Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix and even his own musical inspiration, Stevie Ray Vaughan. He has graced the stage with such esteemed luminaries as Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter, Susan Tedeschi, Sheryl Crow, and B.B. King, who called Cummings \u201ca great guitarist.\u201d He also has worked with renowned industry producers Jim Gaines and David Z. Freshly signed to Provogue Records, a division of Mascot Label Group, Cummings joins the elite ranks of such guitar virtuosos as Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout and Eric Gales. \u201cIt's such an honor to be part of a label that has helped shape the careers of the greatest guitar players our world has ever known,\u201d states Cummings. \u201cI'm confident that Provogue is the right home for me and I look forward to working with them and getting some new music to the loyal supporters that I have.\u201d With mesmerizing extended guitar jams, Cummings' Fender Strat sings while he takes you on a twisting, turning blues roller coaster. Featuring a tight, pristine tone and strong vocals to match, the seasoned entertainer has incorporated the influence of his musical idols while maintaining a distinct, genre-bending style and sound all his own. With six studio albums, two live records and a new label, Albert Cummings is back and better than ever with his latest release slated for early next year. Raised in Massachusetts and trained as a master builder, Cummings learned basic guitar chords from his father but then became intrigued with banjo and bluegrass when he was 12. As a teenager, however, he discovered Stevie Ray Vaughan's early material and was astounded by his mastery. After attending a 1987 Stevie Ray Vaughan/Double Trouble concert during college, Cummings' entire world exploded as he turned his attention back to guitar, and he never looked back. It wasn't until he was 27 that Cummings publicly played with a band for the first time \u2013 and that was all it took. He was off and running with his band, Swamp Yankee, serving up the blues throughout the Northeast. After a stunning display of his guitar prowess at a Northeast Blues Society open jam, Cummings qualified to compete in the Blues Foundation's 1999 International Blues Challenge. A year later, he released his first album with Swamp Yankee, The Long Way, an astonishing, critically acclaimed debut. Cummings' skill and intensity garnered attention from Double Trouble members Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon, who were so impressed with this relative newcomer that they produced and performed on his first solo record, From the Heart (2003). Reese Wynans also appeared on the record, and it was the first time that Double Trouble recorded an entire album since Vaughan's untimely passing. After signing a multi-record deal with Blind Pig Records, Tommy Shannon would go on to work with Cummings on his 2004 inaugural release for the label, True To Yourself. Cummings recorded three more stellar albums on the Blind Pig Records label, Working Man (2006), Feel So Good: Albert Cummings Live (2008) and Someone Like You (2015). In 2012, he also self-released the country-rock-blues flavored winner, No Regrets, incorporating multiple musical categories and highlighting his unique versatility. Following the success of his first live record, a second was self-released in 2017, Live At The '62 Center. It was recorded in his hometown of Willamstown, Massachusetts, and its incredible reception garnered Cummings a Blues Music Award nomination for Blues Rock Album. Albert Cummings pours his heart and soul into everything he does, and his impassioned, all-inclusive style speaks directly to music lovers everywhere. His dynamic, engaging personality combined with blues musicianship at its finest has created an enduring, loyal fan base worldwide. Albert Cummings recently signed to Mascot Label Group imprint, Provogue Records and released a new album, Believe, on Feb. 14, 2020. Recorded at the iconic FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Ala., Cummings takes this release to new heights with the help of GRAMMY Award-winning producer, Jim Gaines (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Santana). Together, they drew inspiration from the rich recording legacy of Muscle Shoals and created a timeless album full of rhythm, funk and soul. \u201cYou can hear the difference between this album and my others, and that is the Muscle Shoals difference,\u201d Cummings says of the new project, \u201cIf I had recorded those same songs anywhere else, then Believe would have sounded like a completely different album.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Albert Cummings is a masterful guitar player who burst onto the blues rock scene in the early 2000\u2019s and almost immediately began gaining praise for his versatility as both a singer/songwriter and live performer. \u201cHis muscular guitar work is simply outstanding.

After Galaxie 500 completed a tour of the US supporting Cocteau Twins, guitarist and vocalist Dean Wareham quit the band forcing the cancellation of an imminent Japanese tour. Damon and Naomi had recorded a few tracks before the split and these were released under the name Pierre Etoile by Rough Trade (UK) in June 1990. The duo then spent time working on their book publishing company Exact Change with no plans to return to recording until producer Mark Kramer urged them back into the studio. The resulting album More Sad Hits was released on Kramer's Shimmy Disc label in 1992. Following the release of More Sad Hits Damon and Naomi were contacted by Kate Biggar and Wayne Rogers whose band Crystalized Movements had recently lost its rhythm section. The two couples teamed up to form the psychedelic rock band Magic Hour and released three albums between 1993 and 1996. Parallel to Magic Hour Damon and Naomi continued to record as a duo, releasing their second album, The Wondrous World of Damon and Naomi on Sub Pop in 1995, the album was again produced by Kramer. After the release of their second album Damon & Naomi finally decided that they were ready to return to live performance, in a 1998 interview Krukowski said \"We never thought we would perform because there's no rhythm section, and us being a former rhythm section, we thought there's nothing worse than a band without a rhythm section.\" [1] Their third album Playback Singers in 1998 was recorded at their home studio (Kali Studios) in Cambridge, MA and was their first album recorded without the assistance of Kramer. The album included the song \"Awake in a Muddle\" written by Masaki Batoh of the psychedlic rock band Ghost which marked the beginning of the ongoing relationship between the duo and the Japanese band. The album also included a cover of the Tom Rapp (Pearls Before Swine) song \"Translucent Carriages\", the duo had performed the song with Rapp when he came out of retirement for the first Terrastock music festival in 1997. Krukowski produced re-recordings of two Pearls Before Swine tracks that appeared on the compilation album Constructive Melancholy that was released in 1998. In 2000 they cemented the relationship with Ghost by releasing the collaborative album With Ghost recorded once again at the duo's Kali studios. The tour in support of the album featured Ghost guitarist Michio Kurihara. In 2002 the Live in San Sebastian album was released which had been recorded in May 2001 with Kurihara, the album was released with an additional DVD featuring a video tour diary by Naomi. During 2004 as well as recording their next album Damon had a book of poetry published (The Memory Theater Burned) and the duo also worked on pulling together a double DVD of Galaxie 500 videos that was released by Plexifilm. On Valentine's Day 2005 Damon & Naomi's fifth studio album The Earth Is Blue was released on their own 20|20|20 label having amicably terminated their relationship with Sub Pop. The album again featured Kurihara on guitar as well as the avant-garde brass section of Greg Kelley and Bhob Rainey of Nmperign. The supporting tour featured all the guest musicians and one of the Japanese dates of the tour was videotaped and released as a limited edition DVD at the end of 2005. In 2005, they formed their own label (20/20/20) and have since released four further Damon & Naomi albums \u2013 The Earth Is Blue, Within These Walls, False Beats and True Hearts, and Fortune \u2013 alongside reissues of their own and the Galaxie 500 back catalogue. In addition to their work as musicians, Damon & Naomi are the publishers of Exact Change, a small press dedicated to avant-garde literature and artists\u2019 writings.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts. The Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar). The Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases. The Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts. In 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group. In 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead. The Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright. 2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003. The Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release. On November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself. They also feature 70 pages of liner notes written by ?uestlove. These two albums marked the Roots' last releases on Geffen Records. The Roots' album, Game Theory, was released on August 29, 2006. The album, which features a track that samples the song \"You and Whose Army\" by Radiohead, was released on Jay-Z's Def Jam. The Roots newest album 'Rising Down' was released on April 29th 2008.

That\u2019s what comes to mind the moment the resonant voices of En Vogue pour through the airwaves. With their new single, Rocket, steadily pushing its way onto radio playlists across the country, the ladies are poised for more chart-topping success with the global release of their \u201cElectric Caf\u00e9\u201d album on Entertainment One Music. En Vogue, current members Cindy Herron-Braggs, Terry Ellis and Rhona Bennett are recognized as one of the top 5 highest selling American female music groups in history, En Vogue has sold over 20 million albums to date. Their effortless transition into the digital age, complemented by their effortless chic, has garnered the group over 30 million streams and 26 million plus YouTube views on their Top 6 hit singles alone; smashes such as Hold On, Free Your Mind, Never Gonna Get It, Giving Him Something He Can Feel, Don\u2019t Let Go, and Whatta Man (feat. Salt N Pepa). In April 2018, the group will present their most diverse work yet with the release of the album \u201cElectric Caf\u00e9.\u201d \u201cWe were just looking for a vibe,\u201d says founding member Cindy Herron-Braggs of the group\u2019s first studio album since 2004. \u201cIn the beginning, we were feeling that electronic dance sound, but then the music started to evolve creatively.\u201d Electric Caf\u00e9 features collaborations with some of today\u2019s most sought-after producers and artists, including Ne-Yo, who penned the lead single Rocket with production by Curtis \"Sauce\" Wilson and Raphael Saadiq, who wrote and produced the smoking hot track, I\u2019m Good. The Hip-Hop laced Have a Seat ft. Snoop Dogg was penned by writer/producer Taura Stinson, and the group\u2019s original production duo, Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, tapped back into En Vogue\u2019s signature sound with D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and Blue Skies. Known for their show stopping performances, En Vogue stays in demand. 2018 kicks off with a European tour hitting Dublin, Ireland followed by shows throughout the United Kingdom, Holland and Germany. \u201cThere has never been a time when we didn\u2019t have a show on the books,\u201d says founding member Terry Ellis. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed to have a global fan base that gives us so much love, so much genuine enthusiasm, every time we walk out on that stage.\u201d The ladies attribute their stellar figures and age-defying looks to a primarily plant-based diet and vigorous fitness routine. For them, the ability to consistently deliver high-energy performances is paramount; it is also what keeps their legions of fans wanting more. Simply put, \u201cWe just love our craft,\u201d says Cindy Herron-Braggs. While the seasoned songbirds stay connected to their R&B roots, their appreciation for diverse musical genres is reflected in their new project. \u201cWe love the authenticity of Hip Hop and the fusion of old school rhythm with a contemporary sound,\u201d says Rhona Bennett. When not on the road, they donate their time to philanthropic causes such as The HollyRod Foundation, which provides medical, physical, and emotional support to families living with autism and individuals battling Parkinson\u2019s disease.

Like other eager beaver politicians-in-training, he went to every political fundraiser under the sun \u2026 but was dismayed to find the music at these events underwhelming, lackluster, loud and un-neighborly. Drawing inspiration from music from all over the world \u2013 crossing genres of classical, jazz and old-fashioned pop \u2013 and hoping to appeal to conservatives and liberals alike, he founded the \u201clittle orchestra\u201d Pink Martini in 1994 to provide more beautiful and inclusive musical soundtracks for political fundraisers for progressive causes such as civil rights, affordable housing, the environment, libraries, public broadcasting, education and parks. \u201cPink Martini draws inspiration from the romantic Hollywood musicals of the 1940s or \u201850s \u2026 with a more global perspective. We write a lot of songs \u2026 but we also champion songs like Ernesto Lecuona\u2019s \u201cAndalucia\u201d or \u201cAmado mio\u201d from the Rita Hayworth film \u201cGilda\u201d or \u201cKikuchiyo to mohshimasu (My name is Kikuchiyo)\u201d made famous in the 1960s by the great Japanese group Hiroshi Wada & His Mahina Stars. In that sense we\u2019re a bit like musical archeologists, digging through recordings and scores of years past and rediscovering beautiful songs.\u201d Lauderdale met China Forbes, Pink Martini\u2019s \u201cDiva Next Door\u201d lead vocalist, at Harvard. He was studying history and literature while she was studying English literature and painting. Actually neither of them really studied, they socialized \u2026 and late at night, they would break into the lower common room in their college dormitory and sing arias by Puccini and Verdi \u2013 and the occasional campy Barbara Streisand cover \u2013thus sealing their creative collaboration. Three years after graduating, Lauderdale called Forbes who was living in New York City, where she\u2019d been writing songs and playing guitar in hew own folk-rock project, and asked her to join Pink Martini. They began to write songs together for the band. Their first song \u201cSympathique\u201d \u2013 with the chorus \u201cJe ne veux pas travailler\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want to work\u201d) \u2013 became an overnight sensation in France, and was even nominated for \u201cSong of the Year\u201d at France\u2019s Victoires de la Musique Awards. \u201cBoth China Forbes and I come from multicultural families,\u201d says Lauderdale. \u201cAll of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world. So inevitably, because everyone has participated at some point in the writing or arranging of songs, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you\u2019re in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It\u2019s a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We\u2019re very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad \u2026 and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent \u2013 through our repertoire and our concerts \u2013 a broader, more inclusive America \u2026 the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world \u2026 comprised of people of every country, every language, every religion.\u201d Pink Martini has twelve musicians performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Africa, Australia and New Zealand and North America. Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with over 25 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center and the BBC Concert Orchestra in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year\u2019s Eve over the past 15 years; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in NYC; the Governor\u2019s Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; and the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia. \u201cThe overarching goal is to create a cohesive body of beautiful songs with beautiful melodies. And then it all just extends outward from there. Because the interests of the band are so diverse \u2013 two percussionists who spend a lot of time in Brasil; another percussionist who grew up in Cuba; a German speaking trombone player who studied with all the brass section of the Chicago Symphony and likes Miles Davis; an African American singer who studied French and Italian and sings in 14 different; languages; a cellist who speaks Mandarin \u2013 because of this diversity inside the band, there are endless ideas. On a bad day it can just seem all too dizzying. But hopefully in the larger picture, it is a more accurate representation of America in 2009.\u201d \u201cPink Martini represents all that Toronto aspires to \u2013 sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and a type of delight that sometimes involves dressing up and carousing \u2026 with its heterogeneous tastes and facility in languages, the pop orchestra might have sprung from our own diverse metropolis, but hails instead from Portland, Oregon.\u201d -- Toronto Star, March 2008 The band has collaborated and performed with Jimmy Scott, Carol Channing, Henri Salvador, Jane Powell, Chavela Vargas, Georges Moustaki, Michael Feinstein, DJ Dimitri from Paris, clarinetist and conductor Norman Leyden, Hiroshi Wada, DJ Johnny Dynell and several drag queens from New York City, among others.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "Modest Mouse ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363425.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7193649, -73.9387843], "Date": "2021-08-12", "EventDate": "Aug. 12th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102615278-modest-mouse-at-brooklyn-steel?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Modest Mouse was formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington and over the last decade has become the indie rock standard and one of the few bands capable of treading the narrow path where massive popularity is possible without sacrificing their longtime fans.

A Detroit, Michigan native, music seized hold of Cook at an early age. As a student at Cass Technical High School she played string bass in the school orchestra, studied piano and voice on weekends, and sang in her church\u2019s choir. An elder brother introduced her to jazz, Cook chose voice as her instrument of choice, and she became a disciple of jazz icon Eddie Jefferson, founder of a singing technique called \u2018vocalese\u2019 where a singer sings lyrics to a famous instrumental solo. During this time she and close friend Regina Carter formed dreams of becoming jazz musicians; Cook as a singer, and Carter as a violinist. At Carter\u2019s urging she applied to and was accepted by Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Northeastern she remained in close contact with Carter (who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and met Cyrus Chestnut, a jazz pianist studying at nearby Berklee School of Music. After graduating from Northeastern in 1985 Cook remained in Boston preparing herself for a career singing jazz in New York. In February of 1990 she moved to New York and supported herself as a school teacher and book seller during the day, and singing at night. After five years she traveled to Europe and from 1993-1994 Cook served as a guest vocal and ensemble instructor at the Jazzschule in Basel, Switzerland, and Jazz and Rock Schule in Freiburg, Germany. She returned to New York two years later and her work included singing with Lionel Hampton\u2019s Orchestra and George Gee\u2019s Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra. In 1998 she signed with MaxJazz, a fledgling music label, and that year she released her first CD, \u2018It\u2019s All About Love\u2019, to great acclaim, including a best jazz vocal Grammy nomination. Her second CD, \u2018Dem Bones\u2019 (a tribute to all the trombone players she\u2019d worked with in the Lionel Hampton and George Gee groups), released in 2001, was also a success, and received a glowing review from Down Beat magazine, the leading jazz publication. In 2002 she released her CD \u2018Simply Natural\u2019, which was inspired by her love for the beauty found in nature. Cook performs globally both with her own groups, most notably 'the Carla Cook Quintet', and as a guest soloist with artists including Eric Reed and old friends Regina Carter and Cyrus Chestnut (both of whom have become young luminaries in the jazz world).

Their fourth single, \u201cHe Was a Friend of Mine\u201d was featured on Spotify\u2019s \u2018Fresh Folk\u2019 playlist.

Diane had just returned from an acoustic tour in England and began working late nights at a local music venue in New York City. She spent many hours there listening to every kind of band perform. \"It made me miss being on stage and kept gnawing at me to get on with my real passion.\" One of the bands that really spoke to her was The Miracle 3, fronted by renown singer/songwriter Steve Wynn, of the Dream Syndicate. \"There was a magical interplay between him and guitarist Jason Victor. It had a certain melodic chaos, that distinct kind that I really wanted to hear on my record.\". She then met drummer Colin Brooks at a show where he was laying down his super soul beats in The Hurricane Bells. She was also inspired by bassist Matt Basile, on stage with a dual female fronted rock band, Mother Feather. \"Suddenly I saw before me, my new group.\" Alfonso Velez walked in shortly thereafter and became the final addition to this congregation. This is how Diane and The Gentle Men came to be. Not too long after playing shows to full houses in venues such as Rockwood Music Hall and Berlin in downtown Manhattan, the band soon ended up in a cool new studio built in an old firehouse in Redhook Brooklyn, called Atomic, where Interpol and Mark Ronson had recently recorded. Steve Wynn agreed to produce this first EP to be released through Velvet Elk/One Little Indian Records (Bjork, Dead Heavens, Twilight Singers). The A-side, \"Motorcycle\" \"was inspired by strumming a warn in 1957 Gibson drinking a glass of white wine and thinking about one of the new local heroes in town, who plays in a couple of bands, Threats/Drowners. B- side \"Boyfriend\" and bonus track \"Wasted Word\" were blasted through fast and loose in that instant one-day session. The record was mixed by Clif Norell, (R.E.M., The Replacements, Bruce Springsteen) and the other tracks mixed by Merle Chornuk (Ryan Adams, Nels Cline), the owner of Atomic Studios. With this first EP behind her, Diane began opening for acclaimed artists: Richard Lloyd (Television), Steve Wynn, Jesse Malin, Tommy Stinson, Jason Darling, Laura Cantrell and more. Diane and the Gentle Men will finish recording the full album this spring, with Steve Wynn producing. Tour dates in New York, Nashville, Boston, Philadelphia and the UK are being scheduled. \"For years I've written songs behind closed doors.

He embarked upon a bold experiment called Thing a Week, in which he home-recorded and released a new song every week for an entire year, giving them all away for free. Even he thought he was crazy. But while a struggling music industry fell to pieces over filesharing and shifting business models, Jonathan Coulton quietly and independently amassed a small army of techies, nerds, and dedicated superfans who buy his music even though they don't have to. Coulton speaks to the outcast in all of us, in the voices of characters we know from our own sad little lives: the awkward, lovelorn mad scientist from \"Skullcrusher Mountain,\" the powerless wage slave from \"Code Monkey,\" and the annoying former coworker turned zombie from the anthemic ode to office doublespeak, \"Re: Your Brains.\" His songs resonate because he transcends what might otherwise be a gimmicky genre of songwriting - behind every misunderstood monster is a human frailty that we recognize all too well. Luckily for his patient and supportive family, his internet superstar status has led to much real world success. He tours extensively in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. His song \"Code Monkey\" was used as the theme for the G4 animated series \"Code Monkeys,\" and in 2007 he was tapped to write \"Still Alive,\" the closing song to the award-winning game Portal. That song won the Game Audio Network Guild's \"Best Original Vocal Pop Song\" award in 2008, and has been called the greatest video game ending song of all time. If you yourself can't sing it all the way through, chances are your children can. In 2011 he was asked back to write \"Want You Gone,\" the closing song for Portal's long-awaited and critically acclaimed sequel. Artificial Heart is Coulton's first album of new material since Thing a Week, and it features an actual kickass band made up of actual kickass musicians, the delicious high production values of a real recording studio, and the talents of guest vocalists and actual famous people Suzanne Vega, John Roderick of The Long Winters, and Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara. It springs from a brief run opening for They Might Be Giants that ended with member John Flansburgh offering to produce Coulton's next record - a collaboration that fans of both acts have been waiting for their entire lives, whether they know it or not.", "otherInfo": "NPR's Ask Me Another\u30fbThursday.

Lyon grew up in Ocean Grove, New Jersey and graduated from Neptune High School. As an artist, Southside Johnny first achieved prominence in the mid-1970s as the second act to emerge from the Jersey Shore music scene and be considered part of the Jersey Shore sound, following Bruce Springsteen. Southside's first three albums, I Don't Want to Go Home (1976), This Time It's For Real (1977), and Hearts of Stone (1978), were Stax-influenced R&B arranged and produced by the co-founder of the band and Springsteen confederate Steven Van Zandt and largely featured songs written by Van Zandt and/or Springsteen. The Van Zandt-written \"I Don't Want To Go Home\" became Southside's signature song, an evocative mixture of horn-based melodic riffs and sentimental lyrics. Other notable songs included \"The Fever\",\"Talk to Me,\" \"This Time It's For Real,\" \"Love on the Wrong Side of Town,\" and the definitive version of Springsteen's \" Hearts of Stone.\" Southside has long been considered the Grandfather of \"the New Jersey Sound.\" Jon bon Jovi has acknowledged Southside as \"his reason for singing.\" In 1982 the Rolling Stone Magazine voted the album Hearts of Stone among the top 100 albums of the 70's and 80's. Cast under Springsteen's long shadow, national commercial success eluded Southside and the Jukes, and in 1979 they were dropped by their record company. Now working without Van Zandt, they released The Jukes in 1979 and Love is a Sacrifice in 1980. Neither of these achieved much success either. The band's first official live release also came out in 1980, the double album Reach Up and Touch the Sky. During the 1980s Southside Johnny's recording contracts continued to change almost by album, but he continued to release records: Trash It Up (1983), a disco influenced album written by Billy Rush and produced by Nile Rodgers; In the Heat (1984) an album trying to reach out to \"Adult Oriented Radio\"; and At Least We Got Shoes (1986) where guitarist and Jersey shore fixture Bobby Bandiera, who often plays a custom guitar built by First Act Guitars took over songwriting and guitar work from Billy Rush and led the Asbury Jukes back to their original sound. Songwriting credits on At Least We Got Shoes also contain a song co-written by Bandiera and singer Patti Scialfa, who was known as a Jukes collaborator since the 1980 album Love is a Sacrifice and who became a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band in 1984. In 1988 Southside Johnny released his first solo record Slow Dance containing ballads and love songs, but also \"Little Calcutta\" which is still discussed as Southside's most political song of his career, describing the life and environment of the homeless in New York City. More record label switches, Jukes personnel changes, tours and club dates followed. His recording career was re-launched with the album Better Days (1991), which featured production by Van Zandt, songs by Springsteen, and vocal performances from Van Zandt, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. With Bobby Bandiera driving the band, the Jukes were gaining new energy for a world wide tour supporting the album. But once again, Southside Johnny's bad luck with the industry was shown when the record label went bankrupt while the tour was still rolling. Southside performed the theme song for the 1990s sitcom Dave's World, a cover of Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right.\" Southside eventually relocated to Nashville taking a break from the music business. A few members of the Asbury Jukes would end up being part of The Max Weinberg 7 on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien television show, while some others went on tour and into the recording studio with artists like Jon Bon Jovi, Mink DeVille, Graham Parker, Robert Cray. In 1998 Southside Johnny came back into the spotlight with an independent release titled Spittin' Fire, a live record with a semi-acoustic Jukes lineup released in France containing a 20 song set recorded during a series of 10 shows at the \"Chesterfield Caf\u00e9\" in Paris, France. After a decade without a record contract Southside finally founded his own record label in 2001 under the name of Leroy Records, and started releasing and distributing his new records fully under his own control: Messin' with the Blues (2000), Going to Jukesville (2002), Missing Pieces (2004), Into the Harbour (2005). Southside continues to perform, and maintains substantial audience followings in some regions of the U.S., such as New Jersey, New York, northeast Ohio, and abroad, in the UK and continental Europe, as 2002's Live At The Opera House DVD, filmed at a sell-out performance in Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrates. As of 2005, he resides on the Delaware Bay. His annual appearances at Springsteen's Asbury Park holiday shows draw as much crowd excitement as Springsteen himself.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "319 Frost St, Brooklyn, NY", "Artist": "The Districts ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11441409.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7193649, -73.9387843], "Date": "2021-08-12", "EventDate": "Aug. 12th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Steel", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102729411-the-districts-at-brooklyn-steel?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "The Districts are a rock band from Philadelphia, PA.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "183 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014", "Artist": "Taylor Eigsti ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7983227.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7343755, -74.00284789999999], "Date": "2021-08-12", "EventDate": "Aug. 12th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "SMALLS - w/Mike Moreno Quartet - 8:30pm Show", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102761865-taylor-eigsti-at-smalls-jazz-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "\"Eigsti exudes fearlessness and joy, secure in the belief that he can make music with anyone.\" - Variety Magazine 32-year old New York-based pianist and composer Taylor Eigsti started playing the piano when he was four years old.

He has spent years performing at local and regional venues, coffeeshops, bars, restaurants, resorts, hotels, shopping centers, street corners, corporate events, private parties, record stores, colleges, and universities. His first official release was a full length acoustic album recorded on a shoe-string budget, called Idiosyncrasies, in 2007. He toured the west coast, the midwest, and sporadic shows along the east coast in support of this first release. In 2012, he funded his second album using the crowdsourcing platform, Kickstarter. His desire was to fulfill a life long dream of recording his songs with a band. The subsequent release was simply titled Mike Vitale, and features 6 of Mike\u2019s songs, which he produced with the help of musical friends from all over Southern California including Frank Reina (drums and engineering), Brad Cummings (bass), Jon Lacroix (keys), Johnny Gomez (electric guitar), Cory Clark (electric guitar), Justin Burrow (electric guitar), Brett Bixby (keys), Anthony Gonzalez (Percussion), Bryan Lynch (drums), Robbie Gullage (bass). The album was released digitally and on compact disc in 2014 at The Constellation Room in Santa Ana, California. Mike Vitale set up his own tours along the west coast playing wineries, venues, bars, and colleges in support of this self-titled effort. In 2015, Mike released an americana tune entitled Running Away From Home and exclusively made it available for purchase on Bandcamp. All proceeds from the song were donated to the Michael J. Fox Parkinson's Research Foundation as a one-year-long campaign to raise money for Parkinson's Research. The song is a story about him running away from home in order to become a werewolf, when he was in Elementary School, after seeing the movie \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d starring Michael J. Fox. On July 20th 2017, Mike Vitale re-released \"Running Away From Home\" on all streaming services such Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora. The single was also made available for purchase on all major digital distribution websites including Google Play, iTunes, Amazon Music, and the like. Mike released a new collection of acoustic songs in 2018 entitled EMPTY CIRCLE. He also plans to release several full band arrangements of his songs, as singles, the first of which called THE JUNGLE on May 26th 2018, using the crowdsourcing platform, Patreon, to help fund this artistic endeavor. He plans on releasing four or five more singles in rapid succession of one another. He is very active on Youtube, making a consolidated effort to release one new cover or original song, once a week, and just recently began using the Twitter owned app, Periscope to find an audience world wide; his recent live streams have been showing up on the main feed and have averaged 7,000 to 10,000 viewers per hour. In addition to live streaming on Periscope, he also actively live streams on his INSTAGRAM and FACEBOOK like page and TWITCH.TV.

Dean endured the ups-and-downs of music industry buffoonery before eventually landing onstage in America's toughest and most rewarding comedy clubs. Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"Mohr Stories,\" \"You Made it Weird\" and his own weekly podcast, \"Let There Be Talk,\" on the All Things Comedy network. Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hitmaker for Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys). Dean's comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience. His premises, punchlines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to a near Sam Kinison level of animation. As an actor, Delray can be seen in \"The Longshots\" (starring Ice Cube), \"Hellride\" (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino) and \"Maron\" on IFC.

With his virtuoso guitar chops, gutbucket vocals, and explosive energy, Curtis\u2019 burning desire to play music has taken him from Los Angeles to New York City, where he made his Broadway performance debut in LET IT BE, also touring with the production since 2015. Such is the theme of Curtis\u2019 latest release, ONE LAST STAND, a high-energy concept album that takes you across the great divide: a journey from adolescence to adulthood. Curtis released the album in 2015 just before hitting the road again for a North American tour. The album featured a recording of \u201cBootleg Gasoline\u201d which was also made into a music video in 2016. Renowned San Diego radio personality, Jim McInnes, has referred to the record as \u201cOne of the best recordings I\u2019ve heard in a long time.\u201d The album is now available on CD or through Amazon / itunes. Curtis began his career leading his the all-star L.A. band 7th Sun. In 2008, the band released their debut album FROM THE BEGINNING, featuring Adam Kury (Candlebox), Stephen Quadros (Snow) and Micheal Russeck (Quactus) Produced by Curtis, the album was nominated \u201cBest Independent CD\u201d by Southbay Music Awards, and praised by Music Connection for the band\u2019s musicianship, particularly Curtis\u2019 guitar work: \u201cJT Curtis' formidable fretwork recalls the likes of Clapton, Allman, and Page.\u201d The album is still available across the internet. Near the end of the decade, Curtis stated a notable YouTube series called \u201cOne Man Band,\u201d where he covered classic rock songs, performing all the instruments himself (guitar, bass, keyboards, drums and vocals). In 2010, JT Curtis produced his first solo release, the funky rocking MAKE IT TO THE BRIDGE / THE UNCIVILIZED CITY. With provocative lyrics and intense gut-grabbing music, this single is a must-have! Unable to clone himself for live performances, Curtis formed his own band, Mad Mongoose, collaborating with New York's top musicians (Arthur Migliazza, Darcy MacRae, Tetsuya Sato, and others). The band uploaded a live performance of the Curtis penned funk-rock tune, \u201cShake it Off,\u201d featuring Curtis\u2019 masterful slide work and Migliazza\u2019s dynamic piano playing. \u201cShake it Off\u201d became am irresistible fan favorite, leading Curtis to officially release the song in 2013, backed with another original tune, \u201cNo Room to Move.\u201d Beginning 2015, JT Curtis began hosting a YouTube series called \u201cThe History of Rock & Roll\u201d discussing the genera\u2019s history decade by decade, with a little help from his friend Nick Patrella. Curtis has backed up many powerful artists and groups. In 2013, he was a featured performer in the Broadway musical LET IT BE. In 2009, he performed for Jimmy Carter\u2019s 85th Birthday with the award winning St. Genevieve High School chorale.

Made up of Ishmael Butler (Butterfly), Craig (C Know/Doodlebug) Irving, and Mary Ann (Ladybug Mecca) Vieira, the trio carved out a unique style of jazz-informed Hip Hop. Shortly after, Digable Planets followed up with their debut album, Reachin\u2019 (A New Refutation of Time And Space), an ambitious offering that Pitchfork praised as \u201ca world within a world, complete with its own language and monuments.\u201d Melding Jazz samples, and complex rhymes that touched on everything from the nuances of city life (\u201cWhere I\u2019m From\u201d) to abortion rights (\u201cLa Femme Fetal\u201d), Reachin\u2019 was a rich and vibrant artistic statement as well as a huge commercial success (RIAA certified gold). Digable Planets immediately followed up with Blowout Comb, a bold and colorful meditation on Black liberation. While the album did not initially reach the immediate commercial successes of Reachin\u2019, the album has aged beautifully, influencing future generations of Hip Hop heads, young Jazz musicians and Afrofuturists. The trio spent the 2000s establishing their own individual creative voices with Butler\u2019s Cherrywine and Shabazz Palaces projects, Mecca\u2019s work with BROOKZILL! and C Know leading Cee Knowledge & The Cosmic Funk Orchestra. In 2015, the group embarked upon a string of wildly successful live shows and has been very active as a tight touring unit ever since. In 2017, they released Digable Planets Live, a live album that showcases many gems from the group\u2019s catalog as well as the trio\u2019s skill at rocking the crowd with a live band. A pioneering act that continues to cast a considerable influence, Digable Planets have left an indelible mark on music. More than 20 years after their debut, their music still shines and the iconic group continues to bring their celebrated stage show to excited crowds around the world.", "otherInfo": "Seating is First Come, First ServedFull Bar & Full Dinner Menu AvailableNo refunds or exchanges.

They\u2019d been through the wringer of big hopes and major label realities. Instead of becoming a music biz sob story, the band knew they had one option to succeed: blow everything up and do things their way. And they did. Ahead of Medium Rarities, an odd-and-ends collection that was released last year, the group went through unreleased tracks and ended up self-producing three new songs in relaxed sessions that were fun and spontaneous. While in the studio, each member agreed that they didn\u2019t need the high life and fancy workspaces in order to succeed. Rather than relying on others, The Wild Feathers kept things in-house, producing themselves, which was a part of the hard-scrabble work ethic that got them their success in the first place. It brought the Nashville-based group closer. The Wild Feathers decided to keep a tighter ship, not only with input on their career but sonically as well. What could have ended things, liberated them. They figured out new ways to chart out and work on songs in a fuller, efficient manner. Armed with newfound confidence and a brand new attentive team surrounding them, the quintet were ready to dive in headfirst. The new approach\u2019s success is confirmed on Alvarado, The Wild Feathers\u2019 latest album that\u2019s perhaps the strongest work in the band\u2019s catalog to date. The positive vibes and energy of this time can be heard on the album\u2019s title track. \u201cAlvarado\u201d is a song the band has had in their back pocket for almost a decade. While they were going through some of the recordings that would comprise Medium Rarities, they rediscovered the eight-year-old uptempo rocker and couldn\u2019t let it fade into the dustbin of lost songs. It also set the overall vibe and tone for what was to come. In December of 2020, the group hunkered down in a small cabin northwest of Nashville to chip away at a bunch of new songs they worked on during the pandemic. Using the confidence gained from self-producing the new songs found on Medium Rarities, they spent a week together hammering out material. For the first time without a fancy studio, the band were confident and calm during the process, which cohesively allowed the sound to be exactly what they felt like instead of having to answer otherwise. Knocking out 14 songs in just four days, they bonded over barbecues and beers and there was a warmness that hadn\u2019t been present since their early days. It is reflected in the laid-back nature of the songs on Alvarado. The collaboration and intricate layering of instrumentation, as well as the lyrical matter, on Alvarado showcases The Wild Feathers\u2019 growth as songwriters and burgeoning producers. Without pressure and the newfound confidence to write and produce their own material, The Wild Feathers have done what\u2019s usually a difficult task for a band at this stage of their career: evolve and produce some of their best work to date. If they\u2019ve learned nothing else from their odyssey, no obstacle will stop The Wild Feathers from getting to where they want to go.", "otherInfo": "Please Note: This event has been rescheduled.\nOriginal Date: Thursday, July 23rd, 2020 4:30PM\nNew Date: Friday, August 13th, 2021 4:30PM"}, {"Address": "390 E Main St, Manasquan, NJ 08736", "Artist": "Jessica Rose Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11217232.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.1167763, -74.0401563], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Country Pop, Country, Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "The Salty Whale", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102571766-jessica-rose-music-at-the-salty-whale-and-guesthouse?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Jessica Rose was named Emerging Artist by the Country Music Association.

Barak moved to Los Angeles, CA at the age of nine and began speaking, reading and writing in the English language for the first time in his life. He picked up the language rather quickly and started writing poetry as well as song lyrics by the time he was twelve years old. Barak recorded his first song in a recording studio by the time he was fourteen. Hip Hop did not seem as the obvious choice of music for a fourteen year old Israeli born teenager however, artists such as Eminem, Tupac and Nas quickly inspired the poetry fanatic to start writing hip hop song lyrics. Throughout his high school years, Barak recorded different songs with various local artists however, never truly focused on his craft due to the fact that he was still very much preoccupied with school and sports. Sports took up most of Barak\u2019s time growing up. He went on to run track at California State University, Northridge and graduated with a degree in Biology. Over the past few years Barak The Rapper has put together a couple mixtapes and a self titled EP which was released in June of 2012. Barak has worked with multiple artists on a number of mixtapes as well as albums. He has opened up for big name artists and performed in mainstream venues such as the El Rey Theatre and the Key club in Hollywood. Barak has recently performed on College Campuses such as California State University, Long Beach as well as other California campuses. Now at the age of 23, Barak The Rapper has never been more poised and ready to spread his music throughout the world of Hip Hop and enlighten music fans everywhere.

On their latest album, You Hear Georgia, the follow-up to 2018\u2019s critically acclaimed Find a Light, Blackberry Smoke is further celebrating these roots with 10 new songs that feel like Georgia, accented by the addition of Grammy-winning producer and fellow Georgia-native, Dave Cobb (Jason Isbell, Brandi Carlile). \u201cDave and I had spoken for the last few years about making a record,\u201d Starr says. \u201cFinally, it worked out, our schedule and his schedule, and we said, yes\u2014let\u2019s make a record.\u201d Blackberry Smoke worked quickly, spending just 10 days at Nashville\u2019s famed RCA Studio A, Cobb\u2019s home base since 2016. The band recorded live on the floor, giving You Hear Georgia a crisp, outgoing feel. Like other Blackberry Smoke efforts, this album leans into well-crafted Southern rock driven by jagged guitar riffs and rich instrumentation, as the band layers on rollicking piano (\u201cLive It Down\u201d), funky grooves (\u201cHey Delilah\u201d), and introspective acoustic sounds (the stripped-down, folk-leaning \u201cOld Enough to Know\u201d). \u201cHe\u2019s a very laid-back guy with excellent ideas, but he\u2019s very enthusiastic about making music, and he\u2019s right in there with you having a ball,\u201d Starr says. \u201cHe\u2019s a calming presence and so knowledgeable musically, and he knows how to get what he wants in the studio. I don\u2019t know if we could have made a record in 10 days with everyone, and that definitely speaks to Dave\u2019s ability.\u201d Working with Cobb was the right move, as his approach brought warmth and looseness to the proceedings, while his easygoing demeanor and songwriting background allowed him to provide perceptive insights into this particular batch of Blackberry Smoke songs. In fact, the producer encouraged Blackberry Smoke to pursue the title track after hearing Starr noodling on the idea in the studio. \u201cHe heard me play it, just the riff, and I sang a little bit of a verse and he said, \u2018What\u2019s that? What\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d Starr says. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s just something that\u2019s not finished yet.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, finish it, because we want to record that too.\u2019 So I went back to the hotel room and finished it, and there we go.\u201d \u201cYou Hear Georgia\u201d features a narrator who\u2019s underestimated because of outward appearances and misguided stereotypes, which is a theme of Starr\u2019s lyrics this time around, particularly as it relates to the band\u2019s Southern roots. \u201cLyrically, the song is about the South being misunderstood. It\u2019s obviously a rough and tumble world, and there\u2019s a lot of bad people. But there\u2019s a lot of good people too. It started with the idea of how people might have a preconceived opinion of you because of a thick Southern accent, then expanded into the reality of how some people just seem to have such a hard time getting along, thanks to political or religious views, or simply what part of the country you come from.\u201d In that spirit, Starr found collaborating valuable as You Hear Georgia\u2019s songs came together. Jamey Johnson ended up lending gruff and tender vocals to the pedal steel-augmented \u201cLonesome For a Livin\u2019\u201d after he and Starr started reminiscing about a previous collaboration, their 2009 cover of the Willie Nelson-penned \u201cYesterday\u2019s Wine.\u201d \u201cWe were talking after a show, and he said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do something else,\u2019\u201d Starr says. \u201cI said, \u2018I have this song, it\u2019s really a honky-tonk song. And he said, \u2018Send it to me,\u2019 and I did, and he dug it.\u201d And so he came down to the studio and just killed it. He has a voice like no other.\u201d Starr also co-wrote most of the album\u2019s songs with friends, including current Lynyrd Skynyrd member Rickey Medlocke (\u201cOld Scarecrow\u201d) and Gov\u2019t Mule\u2019s Warren Haynes (\u201cAll Rise Again\u201d), as well as two frequent collaborators, Four Horsemen guitarist Dave Lizmi, and ex-Buckcherry member Keith Nelson. \u201cThat\u2019s just an enjoyable thing to do sometimes,\u201d Starr says of co-writing with pals. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s just knock heads together and see what we come up with.\u2019 And sometimes it\u2019s magical.\u201d The songs Starr wrote with Haynes, Lizmi and Nelson came together in the early stages of 2020\u2019s pandemic-driven lockdown. But save for \u201cAll Rise Again\u201d\u2014a surging highlight with a trademark Haynes blues-jam solo and an optimistic vibe\u2014these lyrics aren\u2019t explicitly about the disorienting experience of the lockdown. \u201cThere were so many musicians stuck in their living room,\u201d Starr explains. \u201cThose songs were born out of that necessity to create and make new music. You\u2019ve gotta be moving forward.\u201d Unsurprisingly, many of You Hear Georgia\u2019s songs describe characters that are restless and prone to seeking out a change of scenery, in hopes of finding a place where they belong. Against cinematic backdrops with vivid details, it\u2019s easy to empathize with these protagonists as they share pearls of wisdom (\u201cDon\u2019t ever trust a grown man with a nickname\u201d) and exhibit deep self-awareness (\u201cAnywhere\u2019s better than staying here, with the ghosts running thru his mind\u201d) along the way. The hard-touring Blackberry Smoke knows a little something about hitting the road in order to find a place to belong. Over the years, the band\u2019s toured with ZZ Top, Zac Brown Band, and Eric Church, while the group\u2019s last four full-lengths reached the top 10 of the Billboard country charts, with two of these albums (2015\u2019s Holding All The Roses and 2016\u2019s Like An Arrow) landing at No. 1. You Hear Georgia reinforces that the band members have come so far together because they also can rely on one another for support and creative direction, no matter what the circumstances. \u201cHaving played music together for so long, it does become a sort of a telepathic thing, where we all are nodding our head at the same time, like, \u2018A-ha, I know what this feels like,\u2019 or what it should feel and sound like,\u201d Starr says. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so enjoyable to be in a band: to play with the same dudes decade after decade,\u201d he adds. \u201cBecause when you land on something that works to you, you don\u2019t want to stop. You want to keep doing it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "909 Ocean Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "The Allman Betts Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10465005.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.219798, -74.001015], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Southern Rock, Americana, Rock, Rock N Roll", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Spirit of the South Tour w/ Blackberry Smoke", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102308917-the-allman-betts-band-at-stone-pony-summer-stage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "When The Allman Betts Band released Down to the River in June of 2019, the debut album represented not only the first time the group had recorded together but, in fact, the first time the seven-piece ensemble had ever played together.

Many stories told, some true, some exaggerated, tell a myth of a fearless street fighter, a Keyser Soze of sorts, who repeatedly finds himself in uncompromising situations, forced to confront impossible odds, only to emerge victorious time and time again, virtually unscathed, usually with a girl in one hand and a beer in the other. If James Bond were from the streets, he would be Danny Diablo. Born Danny Singer back in the seventies, Diablo was the first child to proud and loving parents mom a Puerto Rican from the East River Houses in Spanish Harlem and dad a Jewish cop from Brooklyn, with red hair and blue eyes, who worked the streets of Spanish Harlem. \"I was born in money making Manhattan, because my mom worked in Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital,\" recalls Danny, \"but I was raised in Jackson Heights, Queens, home of the drug cartels and crackheads.\" The oldest of three kids, Danny was raised on music and strong family values. \"Growing up in Queens, especially in Jackson Heights, you heard all kinds of music: hip hop, salsa, meringue, classic rock, metal, blues, folk.\" But it was Danny's Uncle Tafty who opened his eyes and ears to music. \"He had one eye, the other one was glass but a different color, because he was ghetto, and he always used to play guitar and sing for me.\" USA Roller Rink was just in walking distance away where rap and metal were the music of choice for the kids in this rotten borough. Music was all around and so was violence. \"It was easy to get caught up in some shit when you were young\", Danny remembers. In the mid-eighties Jackson Heights became the mecca for a brand of punk rock known as New York hardcore with bands like Gorilla Biscuits, Raw Deal, The Mob and SFA. By now Danny was heavily into graffiti and went by the tag \"Lord Ezec\"; Lord as another word for king, and Ezec short for the biblical prophet Ezekiel which signifies \"whom God makes strong\". Danny saw his first show in 1987 at CBGB's, a Sunday hardcore matinee with Raw Deal, Absolution and Underdog. Danny quickly identified with the spirit, attitude and aggression of this unique local music scene, and Sunday matinees at CBGB's, The Ritz, L'Amour's or Irving Plaza soon became the norm. For those who knew Danny, it didn't take long to realize that Danny was someone you wanted on your side. While others had a reputation for starting fights, Danny was known for finishing them. Danny went on his first tour as a roadie for Sick Of It All on their 1992 United States run with Biohazard. On a tour marred with enough fights to make the World Wrestling Federation jealous, Danny came back from tour a legend in his own time. Danny never looked for trouble, but trouble always seemed to find him, often because he was as good as beer muscles to his crew of friends. In 1994 Danny formed the critically acclaimed NYHC act Crown Of Thornz. As vocalist for the group, Danny quickly developed into a charismatic and powerful frontman, belting out emotionally charged lyrics of introspection, pain and anger. Crown Of Thornz released their debut EP \"Train Yard Blues\" in 1995, a dedication to Danny's younger brother David whose life ended tragically the year prior. Later in 1995 Danny branched off with members of NYHC act Madball to form Skarhead and release \"Drugs, Money, Sex\", an alter-ego side project in which Danny sang of the harsh realities of living in the NYC. The following year Crown Of Thornz struck back with their 1996 underground classic \"Mentally Vexed\", a juggernaut of riffs and melodies that had hardcore fans as far as Europe and Japan in a frenzy. The year 1998 ultimately proved to be Crown Of Thornz' final curtain call as Danny shifted all of his efforts to Skarhead and released \"Kings At Crime\" the following year. For Danny, Skarhead epitomized the hardcore lifestyle, living day to day, hand to mouth in an unforgiving world filled with drugs and violence. Tours with The Misfits, GWAR and Hatebreed soon followed as Skarhead always left a lasting impression both on and off the stage, regardless of where they played. Eventually Danny took Skarhead all around the United States and the world, culminating in a 1999 summer Warped Tour appearance alongside acts such as Suicidal Tendencies, Eminem, Sevendust, Ice-T, Dropkick Murphys and Blink 182. Where other hardcore acts often held themselves back for fear of losing their credibility, Skarhead embodied a hardcore sound with a hip-hop mentality, setting the standard for not giving a fuck, doing and saying whatever they wanted without fear of repercussion. What other hardcore act could tour with Vanilla Ice and get away with it? Skarhead eventually called it quits in 2002, releasing \"NY Thugcore: The Hardcore Years 1994-2000\", a mind-numbing collection of early demos, rare tracks, singles and live cuts. Now everyone's favorite redheaded Puerto Rican Jew is back in his truest form, Danny Diablo, ready to bring his brand of real-life thuggery to the masses. With \"TCOB\" squarely tattooed on his fist, Diablo is taking care of business with his unique blend of hardcore rhymes over hip hop beats. Making his debut on The Transplants' new joint, Diablo's creative juices are flowing and he is ready to take his show on the road. With the production skills of Dante Ross (Everlast, Brand Nubian, 3rd Bass) in his corner, and a list of cameos that would make P. Diddy jealous, Diablo is poised to knock out the competition in 2004. The legend of Danny Diablo lives on...

The long-standing New York City indiepop group disbanded soon after releasing their final record, The Echo of Pleasure (2017), and Berman found himself at a creative crossroads. He wanted to keep making music, but the themes and sounds he was interested in had shifted; it felt time for a course correction. Enter Tethers, Berman\u2019s first solo record as The Natvral, which finds him coming to terms with the changes in his own life by observing those transformations in the people he\u2019s known \u2013 a self-portrait in relief. In the time between making his last record with his former band, Berman\u2019s life and location have shifted dramatically, as he welcomed a daughter, then a son, and moved from Brooklyn to Princeton. With his new identity as a parent came a crucial shift in how he approached music. Gone were the months in a cramped tour van and late nights rehearsing with his band in a windowless warehouse space. In its place were amorphous, suburban afternoons playing whimsical songs to two young children, while writing music for himself after their bedtime. But in this time away from the life of a touring artist, Berman discovered an unvarnished, broken folk rock sound-- a marked departure from his previous work. Recorded over 7 days with producer Andy Savours (My Bloody Valentine, Black Country New Road, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart), Tethers is as raw in sound as it is nuanced and empathetic in its lyricism. \u201cIt wasn't so much a decision about how to work. It was the only way to do it. I had these songs, but not much time, so we just tracked everything as quickly and in the moment as we could and hoped for the best,\u201d says Berman of his process. Without effect pedals, overdubs or even a metronome, the resulting album feels free and unpretentious, recalling the strident obliqueness of Bob Dylan and Neil Young\u2019s sonic primitivism - but drawn from a set of vividly detailed experiences all Berman\u2019s own. Throughout, he is supported by former TPOBPAH collaborators Jacob Sloan (bass), Brian Alvarez (drums), Sarah Chihaya (backing vocals) and Crystal Stilts/Woods Kyle Forester (organ). Opener and lead single, \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Come Out Anymore?\u201d tells of reconnecting with an old friend and noticing they now wear a wedding band and their hair is graying \u2013 a reminder of all the reasons people lost touch long before Covid. The elegiac \u201cSun Blisters\u201d examines the tensions between knowing there\u2019s a certain freedom in being a fuckup, while also reckoning with the emotional consequences of forever living on the margins. But far from settling on a tidy moral, the song instead favors an ambivalence about what \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d in the straight world means. \u201cIn the end maybe I was wrong/laughing where only tears belong/but love to you\u2019s just a pretty song/and I\u2019m a sour note.\u201d Meanwhile on the gilded ballad, \u201cSylvia, the Cup of Youth,\u201d he recalls a past love who was constantly restarting her life as Berman sought permanence for his own. \u201cI\u2019m older than I was and I was older then/you seem the same when I catch sight of you,\u201d he sings in a moment of reflection as an organ blooms out of the song\u2019s latticework. \u201cSometimes you\u2019d kid and say I was your Galahad/I never was as good as that but you \u2013 did you find the cup of youth?\u201d inverting the grail myth and resisting inhabiting the treacly virtue of the painfully pure at heart white knight. Tethers, in spirit and sound, is a taut rope, charged with the tension between wanting to go out and know the world, and the love that compels Berman to stay home and find peace with his young family. In Berman\u2019s eyes, the two are not mutually exclusive. \u201cBefore my daughter was born, I was afraid she would take me away from music. When she was born, I was afraid music would take me away from her. But now I know I need both to continue to grow as a parent and an artist.\u201d To dream of being homeward bound and also to walk the earth makes life more electric. As Berman puts it, \u201cI always wanted to know the fullness of life \u2013 and I didn\u2019t want to be a tour guide at my own museum.\u201d On Tethers, Berman has re-emerged with a bracing debut, reveling in the freedom to go his own way, even if that way is home.", "otherInfo": "Tobin Sprout\nThe Natvral"}, {"Address": "1 Main St, East Rockaway, NY 11518", "Artist": "South of Sunrise ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10278508.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6399571, -73.6596327], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "70s, Tribute Band, Pop, Rock, 80s, 2000s, 90s, Cover Band, Dance Pop, Alternative, Classic Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Reel", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102753311-south-of-sunrise-at-reel?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Top 40 Cover Band - Over 25 years of good times! - Performing the best of radio rock from the 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s.

The group formed in London in 1974. The two main writing partners in the band, Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, are widely considered to be among the finest melodic pop songwriters of their generation and have often been compared with the legendary Lennon-McCartney partnership, although unlike The Beatles, Difford and Tilbrook's direct collaboration on songs continued through most of the group's career. The original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland. Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike & The Mechanics as well as a solo artist. Since the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks. In 2007 Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain. These dates are to support a new Greatest Hits CD and DVD (Essential Squeeze- released 30/04/07) Glenn Tilbrook is also releasing his original demos on CD, the first of these (The Past Has Been Bottled) is also released on 30/04/07.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today. Having made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own. While it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center. The group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth. Curtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d \u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d Understanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet. The dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says. The emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life. Curtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d Establishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop. Curtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums. \u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board. \u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "95 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "Electric Dream ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8721239.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.72123120000001, -73.9883747], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Arlene's Grocery", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022136636-electric-dream-at-arlene's-grocery?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Big Gorgeous, Kay Day, Alice, Electric Dream at Arlene's Grocery!"}, {"Address": "6316 Mt Morris Park W, New York, NY 10027", "Artist": "Carla Cook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8997747.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.8051647, -73.9452757], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Craig Harris' Nocturnal Nubian Ball", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102790810-carla-cook-at-marcus-garvey-park?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Carla Cook is Grammy-nominated jazz vocalist. A Detroit, Michigan native, music seized hold of Cook at an early age. As a student at Cass Technical High School she played string bass in the school orchestra, studied piano and voice on weekends, and sang in her church\u2019s choir. An elder brother introduced her to jazz, Cook chose voice as her instrument of choice, and she became a disciple of jazz icon Eddie Jefferson, founder of a singing technique called \u2018vocalese\u2019 where a singer sings lyrics to a famous instrumental solo. During this time she and close friend Regina Carter formed dreams of becoming jazz musicians; Cook as a singer, and Carter as a violinist. At Carter\u2019s urging she applied to and was accepted by Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Northeastern she remained in close contact with Carter (who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and met Cyrus Chestnut, a jazz pianist studying at nearby Berklee School of Music. After graduating from Northeastern in 1985 Cook remained in Boston preparing herself for a career singing jazz in New York. In February of 1990 she moved to New York and supported herself as a school teacher and book seller during the day, and singing at night. After five years she traveled to Europe and from 1993-1994 Cook served as a guest vocal and ensemble instructor at the Jazzschule in Basel, Switzerland, and Jazz and Rock Schule in Freiburg, Germany. She returned to New York two years later and her work included singing with Lionel Hampton\u2019s Orchestra and George Gee\u2019s Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra. In 1998 she signed with MaxJazz, a fledgling music label, and that year she released her first CD, \u2018It\u2019s All About Love\u2019, to great acclaim, including a best jazz vocal Grammy nomination. Her second CD, \u2018Dem Bones\u2019 (a tribute to all the trombone players she\u2019d worked with in the Lionel Hampton and George Gee groups), released in 2001, was also a success, and received a glowing review from Down Beat magazine, the leading jazz publication. In 2002 she released her CD \u2018Simply Natural\u2019, which was inspired by her love for the beauty found in nature.

So it's no surprise the family theme courses through many of its 12 songs. His music career has been a family project ever since he became a full-time touring artist a decade ago. That was right around the time when Jesse met his wife Jess working on a cruise ship in the South Pacific. \"As soon as we got back to the states, I proposed to her at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in July 2010 and we packed up the car for the first tour right after that. We've been touring together full-time ever since.\" Now with two-year-old Lily added to the clan, family is more important than ever to him, including the parental urge to love and protect. \"If I were the moon, I\u2019d light all of your back roads,\" he sings in \"If I Were The Moon\": \"You wouldn\u2019t need no headlights / I\u2019d always be full.\" The life of a touring family inspired the album's title track. \"When we wander, when we wander / Don\u2019t it feel like we\u2019re finally found.\" But in the face of the pandemic, he has found that \"wandering is not just a literal thing. We've followed our hearts with so many decisions in 2020-2021, and have found that there are many ways to wander and be free and brave.\" One of those ways has been going virtual. He says that his livestream concerts have \"become the highlight of my week and the thing that sustains us emotionally and financially. And an amazing community has sprung up from these concerts.\" The stage had been Jesse's home for a decade. He plays around 150 shows a year, from Bonnaroo to the Philadelphia Folk Festival, the 30A Songwriters Festival to AmericanaFest. When the pandemic canceled concerts and delayed the album's release, he pivoted to performing online and found a strong new connection to his fans, who had helped fund his albums all along. \"My musical tribe has always been there for me,\" he says with gratitude. Though recorded in 2019, the songs off the new album click with fans online too. He and his band recorded When We Wander live in the studio, a first for his career. \"I wanted to try that Jason Isbell, Chris Stapleton, Neil Young approach to live recording, prioritizing emotion and raw performances over perfection. I loved that experience.\" Recorded live, the album resonates especially with the intimacy and community spirit of the online shows. He also wrote all the music and lyrics this time, instead of working with collaborators, and took a very personal approach, including a look back. \"In Spite of You\" recalls his stay in a residential facility for behavior modification that traumatized him as a young teenager: \"The sermons that you sold me all were fakes.\" Yet he emerged to earn a degree from Berklee College of Music, net a five-year staff writer gig on Nashville's Music Row penning material for major TV networks, and win prestigious songwriting awards.

He's a singer of clear tenor with an emotional range befitting that of his namesake Bob Dylan. During his college years he maintained an esprit de corps with fellow pop song enthusiasts. In his twenties he whittled it down to a foursome fierce with alt-rock sensibilities named M.Headphone with whom he stormed the San Francisco music scene from 1998-2003. A solo artist since 2004, Connor is set to release his 5th full-length in the first half of '21. In contemporary quarantine fashion, the new record is a Kickstarter-funded effort that sees the artist playing virtually all instruments. With producer Coley O'Toole of the platinum-selling band We The Kings behind the boards for this new batch of songs, Connor expands his sonic soundscape while sharpening his thematic focus. The tentatively titled \"Infinity Days\" will be available on all major digital platforms. Son. Husband. Father. Teacher. Humanitarian. As a lyricist, Dylan Connor's subject material draws from such titles. Rooted in the craft of classic singer/songwriters and inspired by cultures of the world, Connor continues in the tradition of Billy Bragg, Ben Folds, and Tom Petty. Present-day comparisons include Dawes, Nada Surf, and Phoebe Bridgers, while Connor himself claims kindred spirit influences including Jeff Buckley, Matthew Sweet's power pop, and Death Cab For Cutie. 2004's \"Plug In\" marked the first of four collaborations with acclaimed producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads) and saw Dylan Connor recognized by American Songwriter Magazine with a nod for Best Lyrics. Ten years and several album/touring cycles later, Connor released 2014's \"Blood Like Fire (Songs For Syria)\" \u2013 a charity project highlighting the war in Syria with 100% of proceeds allocated to the education of Syrian refugees via the Karam Foundation. Connor then contributed his song \"Man of Peace\" to the 2016 feature film documentary \"Little Gandhi\" by writer/director Sam Kadi that became Syria's first official submission for \"Best Foreign Language Film\" during the 90th Academy Awards. Connor also serves as Chair of Missions for the Syrian-American Council and has embarked upon humanitarian expeditions to the Syrian border to deliver aid and help raise awareness in solidarity with all those affected by the nearly decade-long war. Connor first came to love the country and its people after having married a Syrian immigrant and making several visits to her homeland. The spiritual union with his Syrian partner led to the cognizant evolution of his art. Once the revolution began, Connor knew he would not remain silent. \"If Only You'd Listen\" (2019) \u2013 a single co-written and produced by Coley O'Toole \u2013 features Connor's empathetic voice amidst an ornate, Beatles-esque arrangement. A song of stately immediacy imploring adult listeners to take action on behalf of children amidst today's combined crises of climate change, gun violence and war, \"If Only You'd Listen\" has over 8 million streams online. February 2021 sees Dylan Connor contributing his current single \"Bring You Back\" to the theatrical and VOD release of \"Adverse,\" a new crime thriller starring Sean Astin and Mickey Rourke. \"Bring You Back\" was commissioned by writer/director Brian Metcalf after being impressed by Connor's talent, sincerity and knack for melody. Produced by Brooklyn-based musician Mark Mollica, \"Bring You Back\" strikes an elegiac tone while demonstrating Connor's ability to collaborate on another's creative vision. Anchored along the Connecticut shoreline where he lives with his wife and two children, Dylan Connor teaches Latin to high schoolers in between concert performances at venues like NYC\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, L.A.\u2018s The Mint, and CT\u2019s Fairfield Theatre Company.", "otherInfo": "Every Friday (almost) I will be playing a solo show at Las Vetas Lounge as I get warmed up for the release of my new record Infinity Days and for a fall 2021 tour."}, {"Address": "4210 Palisades Cte Dr A - 401, West Nyack, NY 10994", "Artist": "Colin Jost ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9619666.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.0981032, -73.95797979999999], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "West Nyack Levity Live Comedy Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022637435-colin-jost-at-west-nyack-levity-live-comedy-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "EVENT INFO:There is a two-item minimum purchase requirement in the showroom for all guests.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey. Born on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own. John Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\" For Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing. With Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003). A veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza. In addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers. John has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon. Pizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "58-20 Utopia Pkwy, Queens County, NY 11365", "Artist": "The Bronx Wanderers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9307747.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7404652, -73.79360919999999], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Doo-wop & Pop Rock & Roll", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bronx Wanderers @ St. Francis Prep", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102668160-the-bronx-wanderers-at-francis-lewis-high-school?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "With superlative vocals and musicianship, dynamic enthusiasm and a genuine love of the music they perform, The Bronx Wanderers create an energetic bond with their audiences, ensuring an evening of dancing in the aisles, toe-tapping, and clapping all night long.

For New Jersey singer/songwriter Tara Dente, that duo of traits is on full display on the new album called Truth In The Mud. Grounded in a kind of rootsy Americana, it\u2019s only after letting each song bloom that one begins to hear all of Dente\u2019s varied influences. From her early years surrounded by the sound of Celtic and church hymns, to her self-guided tour through American vernacular music, you hear solid fingerpicking, storytelling, and a voice that always offers comfort. And from influences as diverse as Nick Drake and Enya, you hear a focus on not just songcraft, but soundcraft - using words and music seamlessly to create a cohesive whole. Since stepping into Asbury Park\u2019s music scene back in 2012, Dente\u2019s reputation has been steadily building, buoyed by her standout 2014 debut called Leave Your Ghosts Behind as well as 2017\u2019s The Gleaner, released worldwide on Travianna Records. With Truth In The Mud, Dente has made her most compelling artistic statement yet. This is the work of an artist in complete command, but still vulnerable to the kind of self-doubt that makes her feel approachable and welcoming. There\u2019s comfort in her songs, because Tara Dente knows what to say - and how to say it - at exactly the right time. Never is that more accurate than on \u2018Hill So Steep,\u2019 the new album\u2019s leadoff track. Despite being written well before 2020\u2019s unprecedented disruption to artistic life, Dente tackles the classic Sisyphean predicament that has become all too familiar for artists living and working in our current environment. As she explains, \u201c\u2019Hill So Steep\u2019 is about a dream I had. In the dream, I was driving up a hill so steep, I felt like I was climbing the steepest roller coaster with no belt on or bar to hold me in and would just fall out. The dream certainly reflected difficult circumstances happening in my life at the time. I was a server at a popular restaurant in my town and did pretty well in tips that day. As soon as I turned the corner walking to my car after work, I noticed it, as well as a slew of other cars, had been towed. The dollar amount it took to get my car back from the auto shop was the exact amount I had made that day in tips. That night, I had the dream. Sometimes you take a step forward, and then take a step right back. But then another day, you'll take three steps forward. You just have to hang in there the best you can and look for the next right thing.\" Truth In The Mud is a giant step forward. And there are many more to come. This is no longer an artist on her way. Tara Dente is already here.

Their power-packed performance of Michael Jackson\u2019s expansive catalog has ignited crowds on every continent and can only be described as a jaw-dropping, musical must-see. As the longest-running Michael Jackson tribute band, and the only one to predate his untimely passing, Who\u2019s Bad has awed even the skeptics, selling out nearly 50 venues in the United Kingdom including London\u2019s O2 in December of 2010, the venue where the King of Pop was slated to end his career with a 50-show \u201cThis Is It\u201d concert series. Beyond this unparalleled achievement, Who\u2019s Bad has checked some of the world\u2019s most famous pavilions off their \u2018to-do\u2019 list, selling out their first tour of China with stops at Ningbo\u2019s Grand Theatre and Hunan Grand Theatre in Chengsha. Never neglecting Michael\u2019s U.S. fans, Who\u2019s Bad has packed The House of Blues franchise all across the United States; rocked DC\u2019s 930 Club and returned to their native Chapel Hill, NC boasting larger, more eagerly-awaited performances with every romp around the globe. Sold-out shows from Colorado\u2019s Bluebird Theatre and LA\u2019s Gibson Amphitheatre and Romania\u2019s Sala Palatalui to Teatro do Bourbon Country (Porto Alegre, Brazil) tell the story: no corner of the earth is safe from this infectious party production. Who\u2019s Bad has earned its name by paying studious attention to Michael Jackson\u2019s every original groove and gravity-defying dance move, boasting over 100 years of professional experience and a team of dancers with resumes that include Broadway productions such as Phantom of the Opera. Vamsi Tadepalli (Who\u2019s Bad founder, musical director, and saxophonist) assembled a cast of North Carolina\u2019s premiere musicians and, from Who\u2019s Bad\u2019s inception, believed in the band\u2019s boundless possibilities. The velvety vocals and pinpoint choreography of frontmen Joseph Bell and Taalib York\u2019s combined with the six-piece band\u2019s synchronized dance routines, blaring horns and down-deep rhythms, results in a performance delivered with soul and precision superseded by no one but the King himself. They\u2019ve shared stages with the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, The Backstreet Boys, The Four Tops, Boys II Men, and hip hop superstar, Pitbull. Captivated fans include LIVENATION\u2019s Anthony Nicolaidis who calls Who\u2019s Bad, \u201cthe real deal,\u201d and Michael Jackson\u2019s longtime friend and manager Frank DiLeo who proclaimed after Who\u2019s Bad show in Nashville, TN, \u201cthe show was great\u2026.Michael would have been proud!\u201d Whether you idolized the Jackson 5, fell in love to Human Nature, or learned to moonwalk to Billie Jean, Who\u2019s Bad is THE ULTIMATE music-and-dance driven Michael Jackson homage. This band of professionals relentlessly elevate the legacy of pop music\u2019s King, always pushing themselves to be more precise, to raise the level of excitement and awe, while embodying Michael Jackson\u2019s mission to bring people together of all races, genders, and cultures through music. As the curtain opens on a Who\u2019s Bad performance, every MJ fan feels the adrenaline, screams at the sight of that unmistakable silhouette, and succumbs to a surefire Michael Jackson sing-along. The energy is purely magnetic, the musicianship is first-rate, the dance moves deftly inspired. Who\u2019s Bad is a tribute befitting a King and their high- octane execution of MJ\u2019s music and dance has catapulted them to the exclusive rank of Ultimate!", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "325 Franklin Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Werk ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6132409.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6883003, -73.9568077], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Industrial, Alternative, Post-hardcore", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "C'mon Everybody", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022614906-werk-at-c'mon-everybody?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Werk of Manchester", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "235 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036", "Artist": "Dirty Martini ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7596297, -73.9870239], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Sony Hall", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022658794-dirty-martini-at-sony-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Fire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7761839.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Psychedelic Rock, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "City Winery New York", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022541970-fire-at-city-winery-new-york?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "FIRE: A live Fire CD is now available for pre-release order! \"THE MAGIC SHOEMAKER LIVE!\", which includes blistering versions of \"FATHER'S NAME IS DAD\" and \"TREACLE TOFFEE WORLD\", will be released on 6th October, 2008 on Angel Air Records.

His inclusion as a playlist favorite from the likes of Metallica to The Lumineers reflects his continuing relevance and broad appeal. Now finding himself in the unprecedented place of having both \u201980s fame and indie credibility, it's possible that Hay has delivered the defining album of his solo career. Recorded in both Los Angeles and Nashville and mixed by Vance Powell (Chris Stapleton, Jack White) and Gordon Hammond (Buddy Miller, Don Williams), FIERCE MERCY explores themes of love and loss, mortality, and even the odd UFO sighting, but always with the singular perspective and insightful wit that define Hay\u2019s work. He has created a new classic in his impressive repertoire (this is his 13th solo release), using a palette of pop songcraft, Americana flourishes, and soundtrack-ready strings. FIERCE MERCY is animated by its pensive, honest, and impassioned lyrics, and, Hay adds, by a sense of urgency felt deeply in the song \u201cThe Last to Know,\u201d which introduces the album\u2019s title concept of \u201cfierce mercy.\u201d The album was released March 3rd, 2017 on Compass Records.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "E 18th St, Bayonne, NJ 07002", "Artist": "D\u00e9sir Decir ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11628330.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6598833, -74.11988099999999], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Indie, Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Desir Decir w/ Slang Terms, Sir Synthesis, and Emergencies", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102809763-desir-decir-at-lot-13-long?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Desir Decir are not a classic rock cover band, they are not a group of DJs, and they are not a bunch of glue sniffing miscreants. They are a rock and roll band from Jersey City, New Jersey, the smaller, much maligned cousin of New York, and as a result, they have something to prove. Their band name translates to a desire to say. Singer, guitarist, Bob Dylan devotee, and former (key word) glue sniffing miscreant John Feuerbach fronts the trio. He met drummer Mitch Cady, a failed stuntman who worshipped at the altar of Epitaph and Fat Wreck drummers, at a Dick Dale show in their home state of Nebraska. From there, they began a long-con campaign for world domination by touring the nation in smelly vans while playing in The Heat Machine and Bandit Sound. When both of those bands dissolved, they got drunk and decided to move to New Jersey to form The Jersey City Boys Choir For Men (TJCBCFM). They met Greg Reyes, a transplanted Dominican brujo who took to the bass late in life, years after graduating at the top of his class from the Hudson Finishing School for the Dashing and Debonair. Greg joined TJCBCFM, but the three felt they needed a side project with an edge. They formed Desir Decir in 2013, recorded two EPs, which were released on Killing Horse Records, and have toured the eastern half of the U.S. \"The Jersey City trio, led by the dance-able, jangling guitar riffs and sing-along vocals of John Feuerbach, have perhaps captured the spirit of New Jersey unlike any other band, with songwriting that is both emotional and tough, scrapping their way to the top.\"", "otherInfo": "Free show. 8 pm doors."}, {"Address": "37 Plains Rd, Frankford, NJ 07822", "Artist": "Whiskey Crossing ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11286657.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.1362939, -74.7164461], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Whiskey Crossing Band at the NJ State Fair", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102609306-whiskey-crossing-at-the-sussex-county-fairgrounds?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Whiskey Crossing is a rising Country Blues/Country Rock duo that surely brings the heat and excitement into the room.

He created a Tik Tok account, via which he began sharing the figurines which would adorn the cover of his next LP.

Still, they\u2019re dressed and arranged like students, grotesque and miserable.

The resulting album, Cujo's Adventures in Foam (released on Ninebar records, later reissued on Ninja Tune) signalled Amon Tobin's entry into the world of music. Immediately upon hearing this record, the powers that be at Ninja Tune signed him up to record as Amon Tobin, and he quickly went to work on his debut Bricolage. If you'll recall, these were the trip-hop years for electronic music, where any clown with a sampler and a collection of Blue Note records could knock off some half-baked boutique hotel background music. But Bricolage shone above all that. Although employing a marriage of jazz and beats, it stretched it further by bringing in elements of bossa-nova, batucada, and jungle, and combining it with a sense of song-writing that elevated it above the standards of that aforementioned scene. I mean, hell, it has a song on it which was inspired by Amon taking a piss on his neighbor's bike after some domestic living dispute (One Day In My Garden)... this was clearly the no-good vibes-jazzy-beats guy Ninja had signed. Next up came Permutation. Although stylistically a logical follow up to Bricolage, it was also on this album where things starting taking a noticeable turn to a much darker output. In fact you can actually trace Amon's career based on coffee shop & dinner party accessibility... and let's just say that this record signalled the end of anyone being able to use Amon records as background music. This one cut a wide path; from the film tributes of Like Regular Chickens & People Like Frank, to the monster breaks on Sordid (easily his biggest 'hit' in the catalog), to the caravan-esque shuffle of \"Nightlife,\" and ending with the ultra-lush Nova (which later was used for Bebel Gilberto's Samba da Bencao on her debut album). Call it end of millennium tension, but while the rest of us were out stockpiling food for the apocalypse, Amon was channelling all that into his next release Supermodified. Treating it like if this was the end of the human race as we knew it and computers would never work again (or god forbid, if we were to be ruled by apes), then damn if he wasn't going make this banger before the lights went out. If Amon's career is a 4LP set, then this 3rd instalment appropriately comes off like the 3rd side of any 4LP 70s rock opus... a time to push some boundaries, challenge the fans a bit, and set the stage for what's to come later. The record was an experiment in sound. Marking the point where Amon became more and more obsessed with unheard but felt bass frequencies, and where he allowed a few collaborators into the mix (mainly Chris Morris of Brass Eye &amp; Blue Jam fame, and Montreal beatboxer Quadraceptor). The record where the Bossa-nova/jazz Amon Tobin was for the most part laid to rest and the dark/electronic/soundtrack Amon Tobin came into form. Four Ton Mantis is a classic, Deo would have done Sergio Leone proud, and Get Your Snack On paid tribute to one of the Internet's finest fake commercials. In 2002, Amon decided to relocate to Montreal. As Ninja Tune's North American headquarters is based there he'd spent a lot of time soaking in the culture and summer sunshine of the city, never once thinking that he'd never actually visited during the winter... Somewhere around the time he felt the sensation of his nose hairs freezing for the first time, so settled into his new studio armed with a fresh set-up and an A La Carte Express menu by his side (Montreal's bible of food for shut-ins) to put the finishing touches on Out From Out Where. When Sun Ra penned the song Out From Out There, 'there' clearly meant outer space. When Amon decided to call his record Out From Out Where, the 'where' meant just that... a record that came from somewhere nobody could quite pinpoint. This was the logical conclusion of what the previous records had hinted at. It was a cohesive and banging record, but one with no obvious reference points. It just sounded like Amon Tobin, and Amon (more so than a lot of artists) can actually say his sound is very much recognizable as his own. This was wide screen Amon, dropping the cut-up hip-hop of Verbal, the Eli Wallach inspired Hey Blondie, the future electro-disco of Cosmo Retro Intro Outro, and the terrifying death march of Proper Hoodidge. The tour for this album also resulted in Amon's entry into the Solid Steel mix series, with a tough ass Final Scratch DJ set captured in Australia released in June 2004. In early 2004 video game developers Ubisoft approached Amon and asked him to compose all of the music for the 3rd installment of their enormously popular Splinter Cell series. Seeing as he wasn't able to get past the second mission of the first Splinter Cell, he thought that making the soundtrack would clearly be an easier way to interact with the game. This was a chance for Amon to experiment with different ways of composing and to finally realize a teenage ambition (although this soundtrack in no way reflects his love for Galaga - even though that was a hot game). Composing a proper soundtrack also allowed him to be a little more progressively excessive, with the inclusion of extended string arrangements and over the top Hammond organ solos woven into his sounds. Italian prog sensation Goblin composing for a Bond film would be an apt comparison for this work. A love of soundtracks has always been a key influence in his work, and it clearly shows here. The game was released in 2005. An accompanying soundtrack on Ninja Tune was released in Jan 05. A 5.1 DVD-Audio version was released simultaneously with the game, putting Amon at the forefront, as always, of pushing sounds forward. Foley Room was released in 2007 and marked a departure in style for Tobin using the eponymous Foley Rooms at Ubisoft, where sound effects are recorded to create original sounds for the album rather than taking samples from other artists. The original concept was derived from an ambition to create an album without music but as recording progressed various instruments were incorporated, notably The Kronos Quartet to provide samples.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "196 Allen St, New York, NY 10002", "Artist": "AllDueRespect ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11032272.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7223225, -73.98858129999999], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Grunge, Punk, Hard Alternative, Rock", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Rockwood Music Hall", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102708514-allduerespect-at-rockwood-music-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "147 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "Oz Noy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8177331.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7284267, -73.999152], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Oz Noy-Nir Felder Band", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102759659-oz-noy-at-the-bitter-end?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cIt\u2019s Jazz. It just doesn\u2019t sound like it.\u201d This is how virtuoso guitarist Oz Noy describes his intoxicating blend of jazz, funk, rock, blues, and r&b. Born in Israel, Oz started his professional career at the age of 13 playing jazz, blues, pop and rock music. By age 16, he was playing with top Israeli musicians and artists. By age 24, he was one of the most established studio guitar players in the country. Oz was also a member of the house band on Israel\u2019s top-rated television show for more than two years. Since his 1996 arrival in New York, Oz has made a huge impact on the local and international music scene. His unique and intoxicating style has broken all the rules of instrumental guitar music by focusing on the groove. All stars such as Keith Carlock, Anton Fig, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Dave Weckl often contribute on drums, with bassists Will Lee, James Genus, and Reggie Washington. In 2003, Oz released his debut record \u2013 \u201cOz Live\u201d \u2013 recorded at NYC\u2019s legendary Bitter End. In 2004, Oz signed with Magna Carta Records and in 2005, released his highly-acclaimed studio record \u201cHA!\u201d with his all-star band featuring Fig, Carlock, Lee and Genus plus special guests Mike Stern and George Whitty. In April of 2007, a licensing deal with Magna Carta and Japanese label Videoarts opened the door for Oz's music in Japan. Later that year saw the release of \u201cFuzzy Feat,\u201d Oz\u2019s third record under the Magna Carta label. For Fuzzy Feat, Oz\u2019s all-star band is joined by various special guests including Colaiuta, bassist Jimmy Johnson, and keyboardists Whitty and Jim Beard. September 2009 saw the release of Oz\u2019s fourth album, \u201cSchizophrenic,\u201d featuring Lee, Fig, Carlock, Weckl, Ricky Peterson, Chris Palmero, and special guest Steve Lukather. November 2011 Oz released his fifth studio album \u201cTwisted Blues\u201d Featuring Vinnie Coliauta, Anton Fig, Chris Layton, Will Lee, Roscoe Beck , John Medeski, Jerry Z, Reese Wynans, Ralph Macdonald and special guests Eric Johnson & Allen Toussaint. In late 2012 Oz released his two highly acclaimed instructional DVD's,\"Guitar Improvisational Workout\" and \"Play Along Workout\", released by jazzheaven.com . For his accomplishments as a trend-setting guitarist, Oz won the highly acclaimed Guitar Player magazine readers poll for \u201cBest guitar riff on a record\u201d in 2007, \u201cBest new talent\u201d in 2008, and \"Best out there guitar player\" in 2013. Oz Noy has performed, toured and recorded with Richard Bona, Chris Botti, Gavin DeGraw, Harry Belafonte, Cyndi Lauper, Clay Aiken, Akiko Yano, Wonder Girls, Toni Braxton, Phoebe Snow, Nile Rogers, Mike Clark, Jeff \u2018Tain\u2019 Watts, Dave Weckl, Mike Manieri, John Patitucci, The East Village Opera Company, Roger Glover, Bill Evans, The Gil Evan Orchestra,Warren Hayes, Gove\u2019t Mule, The Allman Brothers, Allen Toussaint, Eric Johnson, Mike Stern, John Abercrombie, Steve Lukather, John Medeski, Don Was, Nelly Furtado, Natasha Bedingfield, Phillip Phillips, Andy Grammer, Angelique Kidjo, Matisyahu, Jennifer Hudson, Henry Butler, Gart Hudson, Don Henley, Patti Austin, Take 6, Michael Buble, Josh Groban, Phil Ramone, Paul Shaffer, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Sting, Allison Krauss Foreigner, Patty Smyth, Wiz Khalifa, Shelea, Jordin Sparks, among others.", "otherInfo": "The Oz Noy-Nir Felder Band Feat.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey. Born on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own. John Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\" For Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing. With Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003). A veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza. In addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers. John has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon. Pizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "27-16 23rd Ave, Queens County, NY 11105", "Artist": "Pete Bladel ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7755628, -73.9148992], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:45 PM", "Venue": "End of the Line at QED", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102750080-pete-bladel-at-q.e.d.?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Aaron Berg ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Upstairs)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022612634-aaron-berg-at-the-stand-(upstairs)?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Kerryn Feehan, Emma Willmann, Aaron Berg, & More!"}, {"Address": "999 Market St, Paterson, NJ 07513", "Artist": "Sergio Vargas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8800845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.9021172, -74.13973179999999], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Latin, Merengue", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Bonfire Mofongo House & Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022544533-sergio-vargas-at-bonfire-mofongo-house-and-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Cantautor Mexiquense.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1288 Myrtle ave, Brooklyn, NY 11221", "Artist": "Teddy Midnight ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/5178124.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6980033, -73.9247038], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Electro Dance Funk", "Time": "11:00 PM", "Venue": "Bushwick Public House", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022399137-teddy-midnight-at-bushwick-public-house?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Brooklyn based Teddy Midnight demonstrates a creative combination of progressive rock, drum and bass, jazz and downtempo.

Jerry is originally from Humacao, Puerto Rico, but he grew up in Levittown, near Toa Baja on the central northern coast of the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Siblings include Saned, Edwin, Ito, and Jos\u00e9, who all have careers in salsa (one of his brothers was with Puerto Rican Power). In an interview with Maria Conchita Alonso (for \"Al d\u00eda con Maria Conchita\"), Jerry talks about how sure his father was that he would succeed. His parents, also musicians, inspired him to become a musician and as a child he would often accompany his mother Dominga, a singer, and father Edwin, a guitarist and director of Los Barones Trio, during their shows. His favorite singers are Eddie Santiago, Lalo Rodriguez and, in particular, Frankie Ruiz. In 1986, when he was 13 years old, he accompanied his father who was performing at a hotel in Isla Verde, San Juan. Ruiz, who was a guest at the hotel, appeared and sang a couple of songs with them and had his picture taken alongside Rivera. In 2003 this picture was used by Rivera to make the album cover for his tribute Canto a mi Idolo... Frankie Ruiz ('I sing to my Idol... Frankie Ruiz'), who had died in 1998. Singing career In 1988, Tommy Olivencia heard Rivera sing alongside his father and recommended that he sing solo. When Jerry was 14, his father made a demo and presented it to the CBS music department. They signed Rivera. With his first album, Empezando A Vivir, Jerry Rivera earned the title \"El Beb\u00e9 de la Salsa\" (the salsa baby). This project generated the hit, De La Cabeza A Los Pies (loosely translates to \"From Head To Toes\").

In 1996, Rivera released \"Fresco\" and Una y Mil Veces (One Thousand and One Tries) became another hit for Rivera. In 1999, Rivera recorded De Otra Manera ('Another Way'), which featured the bolero Ese. Jerry sang the song with his father at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. In 2000, Rivera recorded Para Siempre ('Forever'), and the hits were Amor de Novela, Naveg\u00e1ndote, and Puerta Abierta. This was his album on Sony Latin records. He has performed in Venezuela, Colombia, Honduras, Panama, the United States, Spain and Japan. In 2001, he released his self-titled album Jerry Rivera, which would include ballad songs for the first time in his salsa career, and Quiero (I Want) would be the only hit. The year after, he recorded Vuela Muy Alto (She Flies High) which brought him a new fanbase all over Latin-America and the U.S., with the title track hit the top spot and the top 10 in many charts. The following year he released Cantando A Mi Idolo... Frankie Ruiz ('Singing To My Idol... Frankie Ruiz'), a tribute album to one of his idol Frankie Ruiz. The album ganer him a Latin Grammy nominatation and his hit was Ruiz's Mi Libertad featuring Voltio. Rivera played a small role in the movie I Like It Like That and will appear as himself in a Latin American soap opera titled Mi destino eres tu ('You are my destiny') slated to air on Univision in the US during on November 2005.

Their fusion of modern and classic rock is a fairly compelling mix since they really don\u2019t sound like any other indie band I can think of,\" - Jim Testa, contributing writer to Rolling Stone magazine and founder of Jersey Beat fanzine. Rock is dead. But hard work isn't. After 10 years of evolving as melodic rock savants while independently releasing dozens of singles and EPs, Reality Suite is determined to awaken the masses and demonstrate that rock is NOT dead. \"Reality Suite has become one of my favorite bands for numerous reasons. They are a kick ass in your face rock band with a dynamic front woman,\" says East Coast renowned photographer Jeff Crespi. WRAT 95.9FM radio DJ, Tom Hanley stated in his blog, \"The female-fronted Hard Rock act puts out a modern Arena Rock sound comprised of killer vocals, complex instrumentals and meaningful lyrics.\" After the 2018 self-released \"Awaken\" EP exceeded fan expectations and garnered the attention of several European record labels, Lions Pride Music based out of Denmark won the partnership with Reality Suite resulting in 2019's expanded album \"Awaken (deluxe.)\" The leading single and video, \"Kiss The Ring\" will be launched on May 17th. This first full-length album not being entirely band-produced incorporates the production skills of hard rock producer/engineer Mike Ferretti (Sevendust, Saliva, Brand of Julez) and pop/R&B producer Earl Cohen (Lady Gaga, Jessica Simpson, Pink.) \"Awaken (deluxe)\" will be available on June 28th digitally and on CD. Formed in 2009 in North Haledon, New Jersey by childhood friends Brian King (drums,) Antonio Valenti (bass,) and Joe Padula (guitars) \u2013 their ambitions have been to produce heavy, melodic rock. After several male and female vocalists, Kimmii Heart had joined in 2013 establishing the definitive line-up known today worldwide. In September of 2015, the self-produced debut full length \u201dSkinn\u201d was released. A unique sound to global rock fans, it was secretly a greatest hits album capitalizing on Reality Suite\u2019s most popular songs from previous EPs. \"Skinn boasts a number of standout tracks, including hook-laden first single, Die Dreaming with the equally infectious Save My Life and Playing with Fire,\" printed the Record/Herald News reporter, Brian Aberback. The song Save My Life was featured as the Song of the Week in Steppin' Out, a NJ music publication while MPire Magazine declared, \u201cSkinn is a damned near perfect piece of rock, one that incorporates the old and new in the right balance.\" After an aggressive band managed social media campaign, Reality Suite has developed over 24,000 followers worldwide. There are pleas from male and female fans of all ages requesting the New Jersey based band to perform in their cities and countries. Several continents are represented by fans posting photos with their \u201cSkinn\u201d CD, wearing Reality Suite t-shirts, posting screenshots while streaming tracks and videos of themselves singing their songs. \u201cWhen recording \u201cSkinn,\u201d we didn\u2019t know if anyone was going to care about it,\" Brian told WDHA 105.5FM DJ, Lidsay Klein in an interview. \"We knew about 12 friends that would be interested, that was it. Months after its release, we are constantly receiving praise from fans around the world. It is so fulfilling. It is truly driving us to take our new album to the next level,\u201d In October 2016, Reality Suite released the single \"Bury Me Alive.\" Leading music review website, Stereo Stickman stated: \"It feels like an instant classic. It\u2019s like the band have taken this incredible leap forwards into alternate territory, without sacrificing any of what we loved about them in the first place. They\u2019ve brought back the things we loved the most about early 2000\u2019s rock and pop-rock, and fused it effectively with this fresh and always addictive Reality Suite sound.\" In May of 2018, Reality Suite released the Awaken EP. Brian King revealed in an interview with PopBreak.com: \"The songs \"Grave\" and \"Cut, Burn, Bruise\" may be closest to defining what \"Awaken\" is all about. During the writing for what became \"Awaken,\" Kimmii and I realized most of what we were writing lyrics about were losing loved ones. Each of us in the band had lost someone in the last two years. I lost my mother in 2016 to lung cancer - which spawned the song \"Cut, Burn Bruise.\" Kimmii lost a close family friend which inspired \"Grave.\" Antonio lost his mother and Joe had lost an Aunt in 2017 - so, as much as \"Grave\" and \"Cut\" are about missing a loved one, in the context with the other songs - \"Awaken\" becomes an album about recovery and rebirth......leaving the pain behind and moving on. The songs \"Live Now Forever,\" \"Dead to Me,\" and \"Lust\" drive that point home.\" As Kimmii sings on the \"Awaken (deluxe)\" lead-off single \"Kiss the Ring,\" \"I don't need you telling me what's right, I've got my own two eyes - I WILL NOT KISS THE RING,\" Reality Suite have never compromised their visions yet earned the loyalty of many fans worldwide.

His passionate performances are punctuated by a crisp acoustic guitar and soaring tenor vocals. This is best shown in his 2018 EP \u201cBreathe,\u201d a four song project consisting only of acoustic guitar, bass and vocals. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed for this artist whose roots are planted in contemporary folk music. His journey as a musician began at the age of 2 when he asked for a \u201creal guitar.\u201d He could play guitar, piano, harmonica and drums by the time he was 6. Kyle\u2019s earliest influences were from the songs of John Denver and Bob Dylan. When he was 8, Kyle played out for the first time. It was at a Bob Dylan Festival at a local winery. With his half size guitar slung around his small torso and a harmonica holder around his neck, he took to the stage with about 100 people gathered. No one expected what they would hear. This sweet, shy blonde little boy blew them away with his version of \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d He gave the most memorable performance of the day. As he grew up, Kyle\u2019s influences diversified. He discovered Richard Shindell, David Wilcox and Ellis Paul, master storytellers who would have tremendous impacts on his work. He identified with the working class anthems of Bruce Springsteen. He reveres their musicianship, their poetry, and their stories. Throughout all of this, Kyle has grown musically and personally. Kyle has lived his life with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism marked by difficulties in social interactions, some motor skill deficiencies, and a pointed interest in a particular subject. In Kyle\u2019s case, that interest is music. Recently, Kyle has begun to make a name for himself in the folk music circle. He has performed on the Emerging Artists Showcase at the 2018 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and he has opened shows for the likes of Ellis Paul, Lucy Kaplansky, and Red Molly.

SONI withanEYE is emerging with a genre expanding collection of music that will attract listeners from house lovers to head bangers with her self-described \u201cHip Rock with a touch of Funk'n Soul.\u201d As she put the finishing touches on her debut album featuring Mobb Deep and Quest Love of The Roots to name a few, SONI withanEYE delivered a taste of what is about to come in the video for her forthcoming single \u201cGet It Together\u201d featuring the legendary Raekwon, from the Wu Tang Clan and her new video for her new single \"Rebel\" featuring cameos from Natalie of Nina Sky and video vixen Gloria Velez bringing a strong message of women empowerment through visual art and song. Born and bred in Queens, New York, Soni Guzman, known as SONI withanEYE, honed her skills in church while singing in the choir during her time at Catholic school. But it wasn\u2019t until she began playing with instruments such as the piano and guitar, which proved she had an innate talent to sing and perform. She expanded her talents of how to work a crowd even more, when added spinning records to her repartee. While continuing to live in New York and traveling the world, SONIcontinuously finds inspirations in so many sounds and cultures, which are magically reflected in her unique music. While her Puerto Rican roots are showcased in some of her past catalog of music, it\u2019s the present work she\u2019s creating that speaks to her musicianship across a myriad of genres. She credits an array of artists from David Bowie to Dolly Parton, from Madonna to Dinah Washington, and from Ray Barreto to Led Zeppelin for her eclectic love of music. \u201cI would love for my music to create emotion, joy, consciousness, compassion and influence people,\u201d SONI states, \u201cThere are many different emotions and a strong personality I project through my music, that's influenced by my experiences, friends and family, as well as the different genres I've been exposed to growing up.\u201d Inspired by her father, who played everything from the congas to saxophone, and even managed the Brooklyn Breakers, SONI withanEYE moves in the same direction by not being able to be pigeonholed into one specific genre. Although SONI withanEYE has recorded with the likes of Timberland and The Beatnuts, SONI may be predominately known for her past collaborations with Todd Terry, Tony Touch, Louie Vega and working with the legendary Jelly Bean Benitez, but her debut album will be fully decorated with flavors of Hip-Hop, House, Rock-n-Roll and R&B. While some may try to throw labels on what her music represents, Soni serves as a musical teacher of sorts, defining what she truly is: a versatile force with a voice that touches the soul with tracks like \"Here to Stay\" released by Vega Records, \u201cSilly Girl\u201d featuring Questlove of The Roots and single/video featuring Raekwon \u201cGet It Together\u201d attest to that. SONI withanEYE currently serves as the face of Cypress Hills\u2019 BReal.tv where she hosts the weekly live broadcasted \"Toca Tuesday\" during which she interviews her fellow artists and party goers as she showcases her cunning on-camera charm. SONI has also created her own Brunch Event Series called \u201cLet\u2019s Play KETCHUP\u201d and \u201cExtra Sauce\u00e8\u201d that celebrates the love for food and music.

Unlike most modern hip-hop producers, Fresh does very little outside production work, instead focusing on producing whole albums for Cash Money artists. Among his biggest hit productions are \"Back that Azz Up\" by Juvenile, \"Tha Block is Hot\" by Lil' Wayne, and \"Bling Bling\" by B.G. The New Orleans native got his start in 1984 as a member of New York Incorporated, arguably New Orleans' first hip-hop crew. The parties Mannie started to DJ around this time were to become legendary and brought him to the attention of rapper Gregory D. Mannie Fresh became the DJ and producer for Gregory D, and in 1987 on D&D Records, they released the album entitled \"Throwdown\". Though they mostly produced what would be considered Miami Bass at the time, they followed it up with an album entitled D Rules the Nation on Yo! Records in 1989. The album only contained a couple of Miami Bass style tracks, focusing more on creating a style unique to New Orleans. After they landed a deal with MCA Records, Mannie became dissatisfied with MCA's handling of the project and decided to get out of the partnership. Gregory D continued to make albums that did not feature Mannie Fresh, but the duo are seen as early pioneers of Bounce Music. Fresh also works as a recording artist, both solo and with the wealthy multi-millionaire Cash Money CEO Brian \"Baby\" Williams as a member of the Big Tymers. Mannie Fresh recently opened a car shop in Humble, Texas (a suburb of Houston) called \"Fresh Rydes\" [1] Mannie Fresh recently announced his unexpected departure from Cash Money records, but maintains that it was strictly a business decision and he holds no ill-will towards his longtime home. On the contrary, his departure has allowed him to get back on good terms with the artists who had left Cash Money earlier, most notably B.G. (with whom he collaborated on \"Move Around\") and Juvenile (with whom he collaborated on \"Animal\"). The three are rumored to be releasing a new album by the end of 2006.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "308 Boardwalk, Point Pleasant Beach, NJ 08742", "Artist": "Jessica Rose Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11208683.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.09356289999999, -74.0359507], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Country Pop, Country, Pop", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Martell's Tiki Bar", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102571768-jessica-rose-music-at-martell's-tiki-bar?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Jessica Rose was named Emerging Artist by the Country Music Association.

He has gripped the scene with ferocious conviction and an uncanny ambition worthy to be mentioned among the greats. Mystic\u2019s fresh sound and musical diversity have proved to be a magnet for music lovers in search of that next level sound that has been missing in the reggae genre. It has attracted listeners of all ages and from all walks of life. A charismatic man on a mission, Mighty Mystic has gone from being a fan of reggae music to being a contributor to the art. Mighty Mystic came on the scene in 2006 after scoring his first international hit with the song \u201cRiding on the Clouds.\u201d However, it wasn\u2019t until the release of his first album \u201cWake up the World\u201d (2010) that he became a household name. \u201cWake up the World\u201d boasted several standouts, such as \u201cRevolution,\u201d \u201cRiding on the Clouds,\u201d \u201cOriginal Love,\u201d & \u201cSlipped Away\u201d with appearances from reggae icon Shaggy and roots rocker Lutan Fyah. Mystic continues to wake up the world with his high energy, message driven brand of reggae music which he emphatically calls \u201cHARD ROOTS.\u201d It is this unique spin on classic reggae blended with Hip Hop & Rock that has catapulted him to the forefront of today\u2019s Reggae Revival. Mighty Mystic is also the younger brother of current Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. When asked, does being the brother of Prime Minister Holness have any impact on your music? Mystic simply says \u201cAndrew has a job to do and so do I, impact or not we both have our own mission to complete\u201d. THE EARLY YEARS Mighty Mystic was born Kevin Mark Holness in the farming community of Goshen, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica to parents Morris & Sonia Holness. As a child, Kevin showed early interest in his native island\u2019s music. It was common to hear him singing the latest tunes while imitating the actions of popular reggae artists. In 1989, the family relocated to Boston, MA in search of a new life. Though oceans apart Kevin never lost the passion for his beloved reggae music. In the mid 90s Kevin began tagging alongside his older brother Stephen who had made a name for himself in the local Hip Hop scene. Kevin saw this as an opportunity and began showcasing his reggae vibes at every chance he was given. It was almost instantaneous, but young Kevin had been bitten by the music bug. The name \u201cMystic\u201d coincidentally was the nickname given to his father as a child and also the area in Boston where Kevin grew up. So it was only fitting that Kevin would become Mystic. By the end of his teenage years young Mystic had already developed a core following and began to take the steps necessary to build for the future. Over the next few years Mystic would have several successful regional releases as well as features on VP Records Riddim Driven compilations that brought added attention to the budding Mystic. In 2005 Mystic and Producer Mike Cip of Split2nd Ent hit the studio to develop a more authentic and true sound. The duo would return with perhaps the biggest reggae record of 2006 with the song \u201cRiding on the Clouds\u201d. This was the beginning of the \u201cMighty Mystic.\u201d MYSTIC OF TODAY Mighty Mystic has turned himself into one of the more sought after U.S based Reggae artists on today\u2019s scene. His brand of \u201cHARD ROOTS\u201d with his high energy stage performance has been a magnet for the young enthusiastic reggae fan base. He has managed to hold firm to his Jamaican roots while adding elements of Hip Hop & Rock giving Mystic a more unique sound. In 2014 Mystic made headlines with the release of his sophomore album \u201cConcrete World\u201d. The album quickly jumped to the top of the Billboard Reggae charts when the first single \u201cCali Green\u201d hit the airwaves. This ferocious marijuana banger became an anthem for smokers all over and has been featured on TV, documentary\u2019s, and several compilations, including the popular annual VP Records release of \u201cHi Grade Ganja Anthems 4\u201d. He then followed with the 2016 release of \u201cThe Art of Balance\u201d album which garnered international success and is considered as a bench mark within this modern-day reggae revival. Mystic has been described as man on a musical mission and this is evident by his constant touring some 8 months out of the year. He has shared the stage with some of Reggae\u2019s biggest names such as Steel Pulse, Damian Marley, Toots and the Maytals, Lee Scratch Perry, Barrington Levy, Buju Banton, The Wailers, Shaggy, Collie Buddz, Sean Paul, Badfish, Dirty Heads, SOJA, John Brown\u02bcs Body, Luciano, Third World, Freddie McGregor, and Capleton to name a few. His message of peace, love, struggle and perseverance isn\u2019t something new under the sun. However, it is the passion and flare delivered by Mystic that has the people saying yes!

Merely tipping the hat to monsters of rock past, Peepshow have twisted their sounds into something youthful, new and as yet unheard. Their razor sharp look and street ready desire to entertain meet a precision and outrageous musicality that\u2019s framed in modern metal. There\u2019s the fervour of My Chemical Romance coupled with the slick presentation of Kill Hannah and Blessed By A Broken Heart, while their universal, rallying-the-clans commerciality echoes that of Black Veil Brides. It all started as it should, not on Saturday night television screens or in the gleam of a marketing man\u2019s eye, but at grass roots level, in the pubs and clubs of their native Scotland. Led by charismatic singer and songwriter Johnny Gunn, a man with a voice to melt icebergs and an image to stop traffic, Peepshow\u2019s surging, futuristic anthems soon found favour. Their self-released debut album quickly shifted 2,000 copies, largely through word of mouth, and drew instant praise from national press. Consequently seized upon as a band on a rocket ride, Peepshow were unleashed to support the likes of Duff McKagan\u2019s Loaded, Backyard Babies and CrashDiet. Indeed, so keen were the latter on the forward-leaning Scots that Johnny ended up co-writing three songs for their most recent album, Generation Wild. As Johnny, guitarists Rusty Gill and Dagan, bassist Hex and drummer Hammy gear up for the release of aptly titled second album Brand New Breed, Peepshow are bigger, stronger and more focused than ever before. Their already muscular sounds have been toned further by playing to packed houses and working with the best in the business. Pumped hard on sheer adrenalin and some timeless rock n\u2019roll stardust, Brand New Breed is fused with blasts of synths, lightspeed dual guitars and textured, flexing rhythms. The hooks on first single Let Go and Live Free Or Die are tailor made for the bigger venues, while the intensity of Feed On Me and the sky high emotions and god-sized riffs of All Or Nothing will drive their way straight into the guts and heart respectively. Strong songs and melodies underpin everything \u2013 music for outsiders, the discontented and the artistic - songs that fans will come back to time and time again. In the weeks before the release of Brand New Breed, their thrilling promotional video for Let Go attracted around 10,000 YouTube hits \u2013 but even that was nothing compared to the astonishing quarter million plays that greeted a selection of teaser tracks posted on the band\u2019s official myspace.

Neither Ian MacKaye; nor Mike Muir, nor any member of the Bad Brains would even want to try to explain it. This scene of ours is misunderstood to the nth degree, and all too often, the wrong party is left trying to school the uninitiated as to its characteristics. Attempting to put New York Hardcore into its proper context may be even tougher. Regardless, most will agree that the NYHC sound - the one most often associated with its scene - begins with Agnostic Front, and if you don\u2019t already know the kinship between Madball and AF, you should probably do the knowledge. It is no coincidence that many of the qualities universally agreed upon when it comes to HC, happen to be the very same traits possessed by Madball. Present day MB carries with it the same rage and rebellion that it always has, but there\u2019s something to be said about remaining relevant, when many bands of the same semi-advanced age have been relegated to dinosaur status. The blood, the honor and the truth lives on through the band to this day, and Madball dares to embrace the responsibility of carrying on tradition - the rich NYHC tradition that is understood by few, and imitated by many. MB is one of the few bands representing this thing called Hardcore with enough triumphs, tests and overall experience under its belt, to be qualified leaders. They let you know with tremendous pride that eventually, people grow up, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should ever abandon the fundamentals of the movement. See your way into it honestly, productively and respectfully, and you might find yourself as a welcome member of the greatest extended family in music. A vital element, particularly for THIS band, is lyrics. If you truly desire to know what THIS band is all about, read the fucking lyrics. There\u2019s no mistaking their message, or their bluntness. The internet has made this primary, yet crucial aspect of Madball unnecessarily fuzzy, with rumors and tall-tales galore. Rather than suggest to you where Hardcore Lives the album comes from, and where Madball is coming from with this uncompromising; dare it be said, \u201cadventurous\u201d ninth album, Freddy Cricien lays it all out - plain and simple - so there\u2019s no error to be made when it comes to what it all means. Hardcore Lives Song-by-Song Lyric Breakdown by Freddy Cricien Intro - We wanted to do a throwback to when, not so much musically, but format wise - when bands would have a song with no vocals and actually name it \"intro\" on the record. This piece was essentially part of the song HC Lives, but kind of has a vibe and life of its own, so it worked perfectly that this would be the intro that sets up the song hardcore lives\u2026which is a barrage of vocals. HC Lives - is a coming of age song. It speaks of the struggles and rebellious spirit of the \"kids\" that sparked this musical subculture. There are many lyrical \"nods\" to influential bands from NY and beyond, and from different eras etc. within the context of telling the story. It's also about how the \"movement\" continues. That spirit is still very much alive and vibrant today. The Balance - is about balancing family life and tour life. We're lucky to be doing something that's \u201cour passion\u201d for a living. The bad part is, we have to leave the ones we love behind for weeks at a time. On one hand you appreciate your situation, and on the other, well, it's extremely hard, especially with children involved. It\u2019s a bittersweet life. I think anyone that has a job that takes them away from their loved ones will appreciate this track on many levels. Doc Marten Stomp - is about paying homage to my extended family, my brotherhood; the DMS crew. Also, the Black n Blue supporters worldwide. It delves into how some people have always viewed us negatively and think we're a gang or something of that sort (we're NOT). It's deeper than that. It\u2019s something that started in the streets and there's no shame in that, but, it has certainly grown into much more than a HC crew or street crew - whatever you want to call it. The song speaks of evolution, and paying respects to those who we lost way too young. It's also an \"anthem\" of sorts for the whole BNB movement. DNA - is intertwined with a connection to certain family members literally, but also speaks of how some of us are built the same or \"cut from a similar cloth.\u201d It doesn't necessarily have to be a blood-bond, but the concept definitely goes back and forth between blood family and just people you're connected to via music, life, etc. It speaks of how those of us from the same \"stock\" are flawed (like everyone) but we have the ability to overcome adversity and change, and hopefully pass the best parts of ourselves onto our children. True School - is a reminder to the young kids in our music scene that well, everyone was \u201cnew school\u201d at some point, so it's ok if you're just discovering this scene, or any scene. There's a lot you can learn from the old school bands/people. You can also get stuck in a time warp and \"stunt your growth\" if you don't grow with the times, like with anything. Things that are novelty-based can be cool. That said, it's not what's going to keep things alive and/or fresh. For those of us who choose to stay relevant while retaining some of those old school principals - I think there's something to be said for that\u2026a lot to be said. The true school is about the die-hards and the new kids that truly \u201cget it.\u201d The Here and Now - is about living in the moment and seizing it. That can be applied to many things, obviously. Too many people get caught up in the past or future and miss the opportunity that's right before them. Nothing to Me - is written from two perspectives. First the \"punk kid\" who doesn't respect who people are or how they came up because he/she basically doesn't know any better. It can be applied to how some newer kids may view us. Also, it can be applied to a parent/child relationship, or just the youth vs. the old wise folk (haha). Not that the youth are dumb, they're actually brilliant. But one can learn from others experiences. Humility is a good thing. My Armor - is about just squashing negativity and negative people in your path, by not making them a focal point in any way, shape or form. People that hate for the sake of hating. People that are envious. People that take on personas via the internet, but don't have an ounce of credibility in life. All that comes and goes, but what we do and how we carry ourselves - that will stand the test of time and speak for itself. Kill them with positivity and actual factual things of merit. Beacon of Light - is about my wife and son. It\u2019s about watching my son grow with amazement and how he/they are my \"beacons of light.\" They guide me to safety; keep me focused, humble and positive. They give me inspiration and essentially, life! I think anyone that feels that for any loved one or friend/mate, etc. will most definitely identify with this track. But it is a very personal tribute from me to them. Born Strong - is about how we\u2019re all born with strengths; physical and/or otherwise. It's about summoning that when you need to, and when you do it as a united front with family, friends, or whomever, THEN you're really \"powerful.\" Spirit - It's about overcoming certain \u201cinner demons.\" This one has a lot of personal sentiment as well, but I think a lot of people can relate to this struggle. Especially those who grew up as I did. This song can go as deep as you want or allow it to go. Mi Palabra - is about living by \"your word.\" People, especially on the internet these days, seem to be turning more and more fickle. It's about having dignity and actually LIVING what you speak - whatever that may be. NBNC - was written by Mike and Mitts both musically and lyrically. So naturally it's them on it. You'll have to ask them what the sentiment is behind it all. Let's just say it's dark (haha). It's one of those crazy, short MB songs that have become a tradition for us. The Beast - it's about fighting that horrible \"demon\" known as anxiety. I don't suffer from anxiety disorder, but I most definitely have felt the feeling and still do from time to time, to be honest. Kill this fucking beast! For the Judged - is precisely that. For people who have been judged because of their appearance, skin color, gender...whatever. No one likes being judged. No one likes being profiled or belittled. I've had it done to me A LOT, and I see it being done all the time. It's an ugly, ignorant \"habit\" that our species has really mastered. Be who you are without shame! Spit on Your Grave * bonus - This is an old song from the Droppin\u2019 Many Suckers EP (92), that we still do live. This was one of the first songs that really demonstrated how we were \"coming into our own.\" Ironically enough, the lyrics were written by my bro Roger. I hadn't quite grasped the whole songwriting thing at that point. I had ideas, etc., but I didn't really know what I was doing per se. Roger wrote the lyrics for a lot of the songs on that release. He had books of old lyrics, and we just utilized them. I just amended some things here and there. All of the above speaks not only for Madball, but the worldwide Hardcore movement the band has so laboriously strived to create, and tirelessly fought to preserve. HARDCORE LIVES!

Paul also showed us his talent for songwriting when he took a song that Scott had written that wasn't working out very well at all and turned it into one of the better songs on the album. If the song Scott wrote was an article of clothing, it would be a pair of footy pajamas with three legs and a three-button poo-hatch in the back. Scott discarded it, Paul fished it out of the trash, and with some alteration, a nip here, a tuck there, and a few sequins, voila: Hammer pants! It's not quite like making a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but he did manage to make the musical equivalent Hammer pants out of footy pajamas, which was a pretty impressive thing to witness. We're all very excited about the song now, and when Roger finishes mixing it I think it will be another pop gem from Huck. Scott is digging the Hammer pants.

He has created a new classic in his impressive repertoire (this is his 13th solo release), using a palette of pop songcraft, Americana flourishes, and soundtrack-ready strings. FIERCE MERCY is animated by its pensive, honest, and impassioned lyrics, and, Hay adds, by a sense of urgency felt deeply in the song \u201cThe Last to Know,\u201d which introduces the album\u2019s title concept of \u201cfierce mercy.\u201d The album was released March 3rd, 2017 on Compass Records.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "New York, NY", "Artist": "Camille Thurman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7229056.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7127753, -74.0059728], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Bryant Park Summer Outdoor Performance Series", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102741965-camille-thurman-at-bryant-park?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Remember the name Camille Thurman. As a composer, multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and unique interpreter of the jazz tradition, she is quickly becoming one of the standard bearers for the form, making a considerable and dynamic contribution to the legacy of jazz while paying tribute to its heroes. Fluid and powerful on the tenor saxophone and highly inventive as a vocalist, she also plays bass clarinet, flute, and piccolo. Her rich sax sound has been compared to Joe Henderson and Dexter Gordon, while her vocal approach\u2014including an impressive scatting ability\u2014has been classified alongside those of Ella Fitzgerald and Betty Carter.

During that time Tim backed legends and legends-in-the-making including Garth Brooks, Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Darius Rucker, Vince Gill, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Jim Ed Brown, Jeannie Seely and Little Jimmy Dickens. Tim's versatility on keys also allowed him the opportunity to play for those outside of the country box, performing with Barry Gibb, Keb Mo, Lisa Marie Presley and Jewel. Beyond the stage Tim continues to be a sought after studio musician in Nashville playing on recordings for some of those very artists with whom he shared the spotlight's fringe--artists who include Dolly Parton, Ray Price, George Jones and Charley Pride. All of the \"Opry cool kids\" knew Tim could play a piano like there was no tomorrow; and they knew he was a funny guy who could make a story come to life, but in the middle of all the commotion of the stage, it became apparent that Tim could sing...and not simply sing, but sing with heart, soul and emotion. The man is GOOD! Today Tim sits in the middle of the spotlight delivering a high energy, fun-filled romp down memory lane in which Tim shares his experiences as an artist, studio musician and sideman. The audience can expect piano pounding thrills as Tim performs songs from piano greats Mickey Gilley, Billy Joel, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elton John, Ronnie Milsap and Charlie Rich...along with bouts of laughter as he dishes out backstage jokes and stories as only an insider can. Tim also discloses the tender moments he experienced on stage like the love he had for country comedienne Minnie Pearl, and his thoughts about playing keys for the biggest farewell party since Hank Williams--the funeral of George Jones. With a musical arsenal that includes hundreds of selections, Tim can fire off a country song with ease, pull the trigger on a rock and roll favorite, reload with some back water blues and win the day with a trip to the A-men corner. Comedy songs are some of his favorites though, so expect to hear a few of those too, along with a few Tim Atwood originals to keep the show fresh. Whether you book him as a single or with his band, Tim always delivers a great performance. He's an extraordinary musician and a great singer, but he's also FUN and unpredictable. Even he doesn't know what's going to fall out of his mouth at any given moment...but rest assured, if it's a family-friendly venue, then it's a family-friendly pearl of wisdom.

The group formed in London in 1974. The two main writing partners in the band, Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, are widely considered to be among the finest melodic pop songwriters of their generation and have often been compared with the legendary Lennon-McCartney partnership, although unlike The Beatles, Difford and Tilbrook's direct collaboration on songs continued through most of the group's career. The original lineup of the band also included pianist Jools Holland, who went on to become a popular solo artist and bandleader, and is now best known as the host of the critically-acclaimed and highly successful British music TV show Later with Jools Holland. Squeeze's lineup in the 1980s also featured the lead vocals of Paul Carrack, who was one of the lead singers of Ace - whose hit \"How Long?\" reached #3 in the U.S. charts and also a vocalist with Mike & The Mechanics as well as a solo artist. Since the release of their last album, 1998's Domino, no new Squeeze material has been produced. Glenn and Chris have each subsequently embarked on solo careers, with South East Side Story released in 2006 containing a number of reworked Squeeze tracks. In 2007 Glenn and Chris announced that they were reforming Squeeze for some concerts in the USA and Britain. These dates are to support a new Greatest Hits CD and DVD (Essential Squeeze- released 30/04/07) Glenn Tilbrook is also releasing his original demos on CD, the first of these (The Past Has Been Bottled) is also released on 30/04/07.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey. Born on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own. John Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\" For Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing. With Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003). A veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza. In addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers. John has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon.

Jerry is originally from Humacao, Puerto Rico, but he grew up in Levittown, near Toa Baja on the central northern coast of the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. Siblings include Saned, Edwin, Ito, and Jos\u00e9, who all have careers in salsa (one of his brothers was with Puerto Rican Power). In an interview with Maria Conchita Alonso (for \"Al d\u00eda con Maria Conchita\"), Jerry talks about how sure his father was that he would succeed. His parents, also musicians, inspired him to become a musician and as a child he would often accompany his mother Dominga, a singer, and father Edwin, a guitarist and director of Los Barones Trio, during their shows. His favorite singers are Eddie Santiago, Lalo Rodriguez and, in particular, Frankie Ruiz. In 1986, when he was 13 years old, he accompanied his father who was performing at a hotel in Isla Verde, San Juan. Ruiz, who was a guest at the hotel, appeared and sang a couple of songs with them and had his picture taken alongside Rivera. In 2003 this picture was used by Rivera to make the album cover for his tribute Canto a mi Idolo... Frankie Ruiz ('I sing to my Idol... Frankie Ruiz'), who had died in 1998. Singing career In 1988, Tommy Olivencia heard Rivera sing alongside his father and recommended that he sing solo. When Jerry was 14, his father made a demo and presented it to the CBS music department. They signed Rivera. With his first album, Empezando A Vivir, Jerry Rivera earned the title \"El Beb\u00e9 de la Salsa\" (the salsa baby). This project generated the hit, De La Cabeza A Los Pies (loosely translates to \"From Head To Toes\"). His second album, Abriendo Puertas ('Opening Doors'), produced the hit songs Esa Ni\u00f1a ('That Girl'), Dime ('Tell Me') and Como un Milagro ('Like a Miracle') became number one hits first in Puerto Rico, then among the Hispanic populations in the United States and finally across Latin America. His third album, Cuenta Conmigo ('Count on Me'), won three Platinum Record awards in the United States, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Colombia. It became the most-sold salsa album in history, a record previously held by Willie Colon,[1] and held the number-one spot in the Latin American Billboards for three consecutive months. Its hit songs included the Cuenta Conmigo, Me Estoy Enamorado ('I am in Love') and Casi Un Hechizo. The number one hit for the album was Amores Como El Nuestro (Lovers Like Us) which is considered to be the best song by Rivera. Rivera was awarded two Premio Lo Nuestro Awards for \"Singer of the Year\" and \"Album of the Year\" and Sony Records presented him with three Crystal Awards. The introduction of Amores Como El Nuestro was sampled by Haitian-rapper Wyclef Jean in his 2004 song \"Dance Like This\" from the soundtrack of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights which would later become the worldwide number-one 2006 hit \"Hips Don't Lie\" by Colombian-singer Shakira and Wyclef, too. In 1993, he released Cara de Ni\u00f1o ('Baby Face') with Que Hay De Malo ('That There of Bad') and Cara de Ni\u00f1o as hits. In 1994, as his popularity was rising, he released his first compilation album, Lo Nuevo y lo Mejor (The New and the Best), and contained the single hit Me Estoy Enloqueciendo Por Ti. In 1996, Rivera released \"Fresco\" and Una y Mil Veces (One Thousand and One Tries) became another hit for Rivera. In 1999, Rivera recorded De Otra Manera ('Another Way'), which featured the bolero Ese. Jerry sang the song with his father at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. In 2000, Rivera recorded Para Siempre ('Forever'), and the hits were Amor de Novela, Naveg\u00e1ndote, and Puerta Abierta. This was his album on Sony Latin records. He has performed in Venezuela, Colombia, Honduras, Panama, the United States, Spain and Japan. In 2001, he released his self-titled album Jerry Rivera, which would include ballad songs for the first time in his salsa career, and Quiero (I Want) would be the only hit. The year after, he recorded Vuela Muy Alto (She Flies High) which brought him a new fanbase all over Latin-America and the U.S., with the title track hit the top spot and the top 10 in many charts. The following year he released Cantando A Mi Idolo... Frankie Ruiz ('Singing To My Idol... Frankie Ruiz'), a tribute album to one of his idol Frankie Ruiz. The album ganer him a Latin Grammy nominatation and his hit was Ruiz's Mi Libertad featuring Voltio. Rivera played a small role in the movie I Like It Like That and will appear as himself in a Latin American soap opera titled Mi destino eres tu ('You are my destiny') slated to air on Univision in the US during on November 2005.

Desde ni\u00f1o comenz\u00f3 a demostrar su talento cantando y tocando guitarra en reuniones familiares, en la escuela y en el coro de la iglesia de su pueblo. En el a\u00f1o 1978 se realiza en Santo Domingo el Festival De La Voz, organizado por Wilfrido Vargas. En el evento participaron j\u00f3venes de todo el pa\u00eds. Alex Bueno demuestra sus cualidades extraordinarias, la potencia de su voz y sus magnificas condiciones como interprete. Llev\u00e1ndose elogios de todos los cr\u00edticos de arte y sobre todo el primer lugar. Su \u00e9xito en el festival motivo a Gerardo Veras quien lo invita a formar parte de su orquesta \"Santo Domingo's All Star\", donde grab\u00f3 sus primeros temas que fueron\"Condici\u00f3n\" y \"Quisqueya\". Mas tarde Fernando Villalona se maravill\u00f3 con la perfecta afinaci\u00f3n y el potente timbre de voz del cantante e inmediatamente lo contrato para formar parte de su orquesta donde graba el \u00e9xito \"Piel Canela\" el cual fue un acontecimiento en toda la Republica Dominicana. En 1982, nace Alex Bueno & La Orquesta Liberaci\u00f3n, Este proyecto fue creado con la colaboraci\u00f3n de Andr\u00e9s De Jes\u00fas, Julie Pie, Jhonny Tulanga, Bilomar \"La Conga\", Manuel \"La Guirra\", entre otros. Dos a\u00f1os mas tarde la carrera de Alex Bueno da un vuelco radical con su lanzamiento como solista, logrando \u00e9xitos de innovadores arreglos como \"Colegiada\", \"Querida\", \"Esa Pared\", \"La Radio\" y \" Jard\u00edn Prohibido\". En 1991 se une al catalogo de J&N Records y graba el \u00e1lbum \"Como Nadie\" donde sobresale el \u00e9xito \"El Talism\u00e1n\". En 1992 rompe todos los par\u00e1metros y record de ventas con el \u00e1lbum \"Ternuras\" una producci\u00f3n de primera, elaborada por Manuel Tejada y lo consolida internacionalmente, este disco comprueba la calidad vocal e interpretativa de Alex Bueno y la facilidad con la que puede interpretar cualquier genero musical. Luego lanza las producciones \"He Vuelto A Nacer\", \"Amores Que Matan\", \"Me Equivoque\" y \"M\u00e1s Ternura\". En 1998, ante el auge alcanzado por la bachata, Alex se siente tentado a incurrir en ese g\u00e9nero y lanza una producci\u00f3n completa a ritmo de bachata, \"Bachata A Su Tiempo\" deja aun m\u00e1s claro la versatilidad y el carisma de Alex Bueno como artista. Este \u00e1lbum ocupa los primeros lugares en ventas y popularidad en todos los Estados Unidos, y lleva la bachata hasta donde nadie hab\u00eda sido capaz de llevarla. En el 2000, tras la magnitud del \u00e9xito de \"Bachata A Su Tiempo\" Alex Bueno graba nuevamente otro \u00e1lbum de bachata titulado \"Coraz\u00f3n Duro\" el cual supera todos los logros del disco anterior en menos tiempo a igual de ser nominado por Premios Lo Nuestro 2000 como mejor \u00e1lbum tradicional. De estas producciones sobresalen los \u00e9xitos \"Busca Un Confidente\", \"Ese Hombre Soy Yo\", \"Gotas De Pena\", \"Que Vuelva\" y \"Yo Me Ir\u00e9\". En el 2001, Despu\u00e9s de haber demostrado con creces que es un excelente interprete de m\u00fasica rom\u00e1ntica, Alex Bueno lanza \"\u00danicamente Tu\", un \u00e1lbum rom\u00e1ntico para la historia, con cl\u00e1sicos de la canci\u00f3n como \"\u00danicamente Tu\" de Felipe Valdez Lea, \"He Sabido Que Te Amaba\" de Chucho Navarro, \"Acu\u00e9rdate De M\u00ed\", \"Mi Pobre Coraz\u00f3n\" del jibarito Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez, \"Pensando En Ti\", \"Vuelve\", \"Que Cosas Te Hice Yo\", \"Entrega\", \"Amor Sin Esperanza\", \"Atardecer De Almas\" y \"Pena De Hombre\", la famosa canci\u00f3n de Rafael Encarnaci\u00f3n.

He is one of those rare, charisma-oozing characters, whose musical and mental eccentricity come from a genuine place. He\u2019s never afraid to take a risk to reach new ground. It\u2019s this blend of qualities that has kept him in such high reverence in the electronic field for two decades now, and which has ensured that his music has been a consistently captivating force. An ever-moving target, his various incarnations have seen him morph from resolute acid and techno warrior to avant-garde nu-skool electro-disco pioneer to the man who gave one of the world\u2019s most famous rappers a new lease of house-infused life long before major labels were putting every urban artist on their books over anemic 4/4 beats. \u201cMy dad played sax and he got me onto clarinet\u201d he recalls of his beginnings in making music, \u201cso it was more of a discipline thing. It was never like, I was this passionate kid who wanted to be a... superstar. Or a superstar DJ, or a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll star. I was quite shy in school.\u201d First seduced by electronic music when house music first emerged in his native Chicago in 1984, the young Felix soon found himself getting caught up in a musical paradigm shift that fostered a lifelong obsession and helped to bring him into his shell. \u201cIt was like a culture movement. So everything I heard on the radio - from Farley \u2018Jackmaster\u2019 Funk to Mike \u2018Hitman\u2019 Wilson - that was the sound I was exposed to. Coming from a family of music, I was able to replay and recreate that stuff.\u201d But it was too late for classical training to keep a hold on this burgeoning young talent and dance music aficionado. Da Housecat took over. Felix began re-releasing music back in 1993. He landed, as a cat does, on his feet with some of his earliest productions picked up by seminal progressive and techno imprints Guerilla and Bush. \u201cWhen the people started getting into my sound, that\u2019s when I started taking it serious\u201d he explains. He grew to become one of techno\u2019s most sought-after names, with a sound influenced heavily by collaborator, mentor and acid house inventor DJ Pierre\u2019s \u2018wild-pitch\u2019 style and drawing as much on the raucous bite of acid as it did on the intensity of techno. He was catapulted from the overground into the wider dance music consciousness at the start of the millennium when he reinvented himself as a purveyor of future retro, high-camp grooves with his \u201880s-inspired album Kittenz (And Thee Glitz). Club and crossover hit Silver Screen Shower Scene particularly, with its kitsch Miss Kittin vocals and raucous sound, remains a stone-cold classic to this day. He survived unwittingly spearheading an entire new genre with that album - \u201cI just hate the word electroclash and don't want to be affiliated with it\u201d, he says today - but continued unfazed throughout the noughties to bring the world more of the magical music that lives inside his head. Albums Virgo Blaktro & The Movie Disco and He Was King received critical acclaim before he made history and released his next LP, Son Of Analog, as a free Mixmag covermount CD. Collaborating with the man then known as P. Diddy in the interim (2006) on the groundbreaking Jack U was just another move that was way ahead of its time. But despite all this success, an increasingly wild lifestyle (including a fierce mezcal habit) combined with the pressures of unrequited hyperbole forced Felix to hit the reset button a few years back. \u201cI became sober and got in touch with my spirit, I saw everything clear. Some promoters book me because they think they are getting the Mezcalateer. Some are afraid of the Mezcalateer. Some find I'm sober and will try to test me by offering me shots but I fight them off. I am Thee Former Mezcalateer. Retired. I found myself literally dancing with the devil. No joke. The four years off was due to personal life, spirit, booze, you name it. I had to find my way back. I survived and I went through my 9 lives over 10 times.\" The devil\u2019s loss is the world\u2019s gain: Felix is back in a big way, brimming with hunger and passion for music once again, and some incredibly hot new material. Returning with a slew of new material in 2013 via his label No Shame/Rude Photo, his rampant electro/disco concoctions will pave the way for a hotly anticipated new album later in the year. On top of all this fresh new music, a huge remix for Katy B is on the way, plus a global tour, a live BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix and his own signature headphones. This is the year that Felix Da Housecat reclaims his position amongst the upper echelons of dance music.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Elderbrook ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8864860.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.710677, -73.92635039999999], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Electronic, Alternative", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Mirage", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022196524-elderbrook-at-brooklyn-mirage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "SPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2vf4pRsEY6LpL5tKmqWb64 SOUNDCLOUD - www.soundcloud.com/elderbrook TWITTER - https://twitter.com/_elderbrook", "otherInfo": "Louis The Child"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Win and Woo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9123667.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.710677, -73.92635039999999], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Dance-pop", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Mirage", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022196519-win-and-woo-at-brooklyn-mirage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "A duo from Chicago, IL; Win and Woo is comprised of Nick Winholt and Austin Woo.

Internationally known for classic standards, late-night ballads, and the cool jazz flavor he brings to his performances and recordings, he has recently established himself as the consummate entertainer and radio program host with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" a nationally syndicated radio program co-hosted with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey. Born on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, Pizzarelli has been playing guitar since age six, following in the tradition of his father, guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Hanging out with his father, John was exposed to all the great jazz music of the era, from Erroll Garner and Les Paul to Django Reinhardt. He began playing with his father at age 20, before going out on his own. John Pizzarelli has recorded as a bandleader for RCA, Chesky, Stash and Novus, and in 1997 appeared in the Broadway musical Dream, a revue of Johnny Mercer songs. Along the way, Pizzarelli and his band have earned rave reviews. Reviewers often compare the Pizzarelli Trio to jazz icons such as Nat \"King\" Cole: \"The John Pizzarelli Trio has never been tighter, and Pizzarelli himself has never been looser,\" said The Village Voice of a recent New York show. \"We can say we\u2019re as lucky to listen to [Pizzarelli] as Nat Cole fans were in the years before he became a legend.\" For Pizzarelli, the comparison to the Nat \"King\" Cole Trio is the highest of compliments. \"I've always said in my concerts that Nat 'King' Cole is why I do what I do.\" Using greats like Nat \"King\" Cole and Frank Sinatra and the songs of writers like Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen as touchstones, Pizzarelli is among the prime contemporary interpreters of the great American songbook, bringing to the work his signature style and brilliant guitar playing. With Telarc\u2019s recent release of Dear Mr. Sinatra, an homage to 'Ol' Blue Eyes,' Pizzarelli's album count now stands at 21, an odyssey that began with My Blue Heaven in 1990. Some of his most recent CDs include, Knowing You (Telarc 2005), Bossa Nova (Telarc 2004), and Live at Birdland (Telarc 2003). A veteran radio personality, Pizzarelli hosted \"New York Tonight\" on WNEW from 1984-1988. Now, with the launch of \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli,\" he brings warmth, humor and that long-lost \"live\" feel back to radio. The show takes place in their \"deluxe living room,\" where he and his guests play live and recorded music, and enjoy conversation that is relaxed, candid, and off-the-cuff. Recent guests include Regis Philbin, Liza Minnelli, Peter Cincotti, Keely Smith, Steve Tyrell and Tony Danza. In addition to being a bandleader, radio personality and solo performer, John has been a special guest on recordings for major pop names such as James Taylor, Natalie Cole, Tom Wopat, Rickie Lee Jones and Dave Von Ronk, as well as leading jazz artists like Rosemary Clooney, Ruby Braff, Johnny Frigo, Buddy DeFranco, Harry Allen and, of course, Bucky Pizzarelli. He was recently featured opposite Donna Summer, Jon Secada and Roberta Flack on the Grammy Award winning CD, Songs From The Neighborhood: The Music of Mr. Rogers. John has performed numerous times on the country's most popular national television shows such as \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\" \"Live With Regis & Kelly,\" \"The Tony Danza Show,\" \"The CBS Early Show,\" Fox News Channel and Jerry Lewis's Labor Day Telethon. Pizzarelli continues to tour throughout the United States, Europe and Japan, performing classic pop, jazz and swing, while setting the standard for stylish modern jazz.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Catherine Cohen ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6737185, -73.9916803], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:30 PM", "Venue": "The Bell House", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022558505-catherine-cohen-at-the-bell-house?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Catherine Cohen: The Twist?...

He grew up on the 'Nawfside' (Northside) of the city but ultimately reps his entire city and the Great state of Texas. A true Houstonian, George has been on the music scene for sometime now, but not as a rapper. He experimented as a rap artist in 2009 but put down the mic believing that his role as a leader would be better in supporting other artists in the city that had more of a buzz. At this point he officially became a Co-CEO of the record label Authentik Music Group more widely known in the streets simply as 'AMG'. After successfully breaking a few new artists into the music scene, George made the decision to pick back up his mic and share his life with the city and ultimately the world while holding his title as CEO of AMG and continuing to sign and develop artists. With influences from his close associates Slim Thug and Yo Gotti, he learned the business and realized that he too can successfully be a boss and an artist. Boston George recorded his 1st official single entitled \u2018Molly\u2019 mid July of 2012. During a 3-week period, he managed to get the song played consistently in the top clubs in the Houston nightlife and also in other markets including Orlando, Dallas, and parts of Louisiana. He also accomplished getting his single played on Houston's most popular hip-hop radio station 97.9 The Box during the Michael Watts show on Sundays. After accomplishing so much in a short time, George knew that he made the right decision to pursue this career path and hasn\u2019t stopped grinding since. George truly believes if you work hard for what you want and seize every opportunity, success is the only option and failures are only speed bumps along the road.

DEAN DELRAY draws upon a life heavy metal and Harleys that began in the Bay Area thrash scene that birthed bands like Metallica and Exodus. Dean endured the ups-and-downs of music industry buffoonery before eventually landing onstage in America's toughest and most rewarding comedy clubs. Dean's no-holds-barred and hard-livin' perspective has been featured on \"WTF with Marc Maron,\" \"Mohr Stories,\" \"You Made it Weird\" and his own weekly podcast, \"Let There Be Talk,\" on the All Things Comedy network. Before he found his calling as the motorcycle riding, hard driving comic he is today, Delray played in an international touring band, opening for Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and The Black Crowes and signing a record deal with Linda Perry (hitmaker for Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys). Dean's comedy is rich with detail and a worldview that can only be gained through genuine life experience. His premises, punchlines and persona are 100% authentic, running the gamut from soft spoken subtlety, to wide-grinned court jester style antics to a near Sam Kinison level of animation. As an actor, Delray can be seen in \"The Longshots\" (starring Ice Cube), \"Hellride\" (from Executive Producer Quentin Tarantino) and \"Maron\" on IFC. Dean's standup act is warm, inviting and subversively full of conviction, just like the man himself offstage. Comedian. Actor. Writer. Biker.", "otherInfo": "Kerryn Feehan, Dean Delray, Josh Adam Meyers, & More!"}]
