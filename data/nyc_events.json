The audience, however, is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar riffs, foot stomping percussion, blues harmonica, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think about looking away.\nThe New Jersey native is able to emulate the sound of a full rock band with his percussive fingerstyle approach to the acoustic guitar and an array of effects pedals. Kenny has even customized a vintage red suitcase which has been dubbed \u201cThe Big Red Suitcase\u201d to use as a kick drum, which has appeared with him on stage for over a decade of live performances.\nHis debut appearances at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park paved the way for Kenny\u2019s developing one-man band show and led him into the national touring circuit and beyond. Over years of honing his craft on the road, Kenny caught the attention of one of his guitar idols, Mickey Melchiondo, a.k.a. Dean Ween from WEEN. Melchiondo recently asked Kenny to tour opening up for his new band, The Dean Ween Group, and has gained him new fans around the United States. Kenny has also been spreading his music internationally with multiple tours throughout Europe and performances in SE Asia to raise awareness about unexploded bombs. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of John Butler Trio, Keller Williams, WEEN, The Dean Ween Group, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple Sage and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra). In January of 2016, The Eagles of Death Metal released Kenny\u2019s version of \"I Love You All The Time\" as a part of their Pay it Forward Campaign to raise money for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\nOn his latest self-titled release, Kenny teamed up with three-time Grammy Winning Producer Justin Guip (Sound engineer for Levon Helm and current touring drummer for Hot Tuna) to create a record that expanded on his signature one-man band sound. The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks. With an influential voice that lies somewhere between Neil Young and Jack White, Kenny delivers clear and concise visions of dynamic musical deliverance. Combining a deep dive into tone, originality and believability, he ushers the listener into his brand new living room of roots riddled rock and roll.\nNever going for the standard attack, he flies far from the 12-bar blues, three-chord rock and Americana stereotype to land some place between a rock and a new place. The album illustrates a highly skilled writer who utilizes the same down-home approach in his music as he does with his day-to-day interactions with others. It\u2019s a combination that will continue to see Kenny reach exciting new levels as he helps future fans \u201csee the light\u201d of his musical message.\nTo hear his full discography, watch recent videos, and check out upcoming tour dates visit www.KeithKenny.com\n(Excerpt from John Pfieffer & Jessica Smith of The Aquarian Weekly)", "otherInfo": "Virtual Tip Jar!\nVenmo: Keith-Kenny-1\nPaypal: Keith@KeithKenny.com or Paypal.me/KeithKenny\nCashApp: $KeithKenny\n\nMerchandise!

The disbanding of Sister Seven and the release of her first full length solo studio album Fencing Under Fire as well as the recent live unplugged CD Live at the Brushwood Lounge has established Patrice Pike as one of the best independent artists today. Patrice recorded Fencing Under Fire with former band mate and co-owner of her label Zainwayne Records along with Jim Watts and Ethan Allan and released the album in 2002. Her single \u201cMs. Ramona\u201d was in the top ten most added on AAA stations for several weeks being the only totally independent album with no major label or major indie ties on the charts along side Sonny Landreth, Dar Williams, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and David Grey.\n\nPatrice\u2019s most recent success points to her songwriting skill, as she along with co-writers Wayne Sutton, Darrell Phillips, and Sean Phillips have been awarded Grand Prize Overall and First Prize Rock for their song \u201cMy Three Wishes\u201d in the USA Songwriting Competition.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn\u2019t about to start phoning it in now.\n\nAlthough the band hasn\u2019t released a new studio album since 2015\u2019s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of \u201990s alt rock favorites. And while it\u2019s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of \u201cSanta Monica\u201d and \u201cFather of Mine,\u201d lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material\u2014especially the \u201cdeep cuts\u201d\u2014not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band\u2019s live dynamic.\n\n\u201cBy mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven\u2019t played them in a long time, so it\u2019s like reinventing the wheel. I\u2019m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.\u201d\n\nFormed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the \u201cclassic\u201d era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.\n\nThis incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the \u201990s in a refreshingly old-school way.\n\n\u201cThe Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cI think this year will be really cool, because it\u2019s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they\u2019re great, too. So, it\u2019s just a different look at \u201990s alternative this year\u2026different facets of what it\u2019s about. With Everclear, we\u2019re going to play the hits we always play, but we\u2019re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there\u2019ll be a few surprises every show.\u201d\n\nFor Alexakis and Co., it\u2019s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band\u2019s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.\n\n\u201cThe tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,\u201d says Alexakis. \u201cThe legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs\u2014they were usually my favorite songs\u2014and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015\u2019s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn\u2019t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public\u2019s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.\n\n\u201cI personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIt sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it\u2019s just old-school, angry rock songs. It\u2019s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren\u2019t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.\u201d\n\nBut when you\u2019ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it\u2019s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band\u2019s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend\u2019s basement in Portland. Although no official commemorative tour dates are confirmed as of this writing, Alexakis says he\u2019s considering playing some smaller, select shows this year as a tribute to the release. Much of the material rarely sees the light of day, but the 1993 album continues to enjoy a special place in Everclear history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just had a baby, I was on public assistance and was working part-time jobs, I was very frustrated and very angry and there were a lot of emotions going on,\u201d Alexakis reflects. \u201cI made that record for $400, because that\u2019s all I had. I got this guy who had a basement studio to give me 40 hours\u2019 worth of recording at $10 an hour. We had 10 or 11 songs, so we went in and recorded them in a week and mixed them, and that\u2019s the album.\u2026From there we just hit the ground running. I still haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nThat rough and raw first attempt was just the nexus of the massive body of work Everclear and Alexakis have contributed since that humble beginning. When it comes to recording new material, at the moment Alexakis is focused primarily on writing and recording his first solo album, due out later this year. That precludes a new Everclear release\u2026for now.\n\n\u201cWe might make another record in a couple years,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe later on this year I\u2019ll feel like it. I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nThat said, the band\u2019s live itinerary certainly makes up for its recent studio absence. As the group prepares for another Summerland run, as well as numerous other future dates, Alexakis is excited to revisit songs from fan favorite records like Afterglow, Sparkle and Fade and the double album Songs From The American Movie, but also compositions from more underrated collections, like 2012\u2019s Invisible Stars.\n\n\u201cThere are people asking for songs, so we\u2019ll just try and learn songs as we go,\u201d Alexakis says. \u201cIf we get a lot of response from people to play a certain song, we\u2019re going to learn it and go on the road and play it. You don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t sing that high anymore.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to worry about it. We\u2019re going to play some rock n\u2019 roll, and just do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join Art Alexakis of Everclear for a special solo performance in partnership with the Sweet Relief Concert Series next Thursday, May 28th at 6pm PST.

These are melodies of depth, and her guitar work is exemplary.\" - Robert K. Oermann, Music Row Magazine\n\nOnce a Seattle resident, Treva Blomquist is now a Nashville local and has quickly risen to the top of an endless pool of talent that inundates the music city. Treva's ability to seamlessly weave a tapestry of folk and soul, dye it indigo blue, and adorn it with the occasional sparkling sequin of pop has earned her considerable recognition among artists and critics alike. Her songwriting is rock solid and mature, often earning favorable comparisons to Patty Griffin and Mindy Smith, with the exception that Treva is more versatile than either of the aforementioned tunesmiths. Treva is comfortable and compelling performing as a solo act, in front of a small string section, or shaking the walls of any rock venue in town with a band.\n\nAlthough Treva's brilliant songwriting and impressive guitar chops distinguish her from other artists in her genre, it is her voice that places her in a league of her own. Treva's range is wide and her timbre is as focused and as pure as a trumpet, and just as powerful. But it is the integrity and authenticity embedded within her lyrics, and the passion and soul conveyed through her voice that are truly the most inspiring. Treva posses a rare talent that is often sought after but rarely obtained.\n\nBlomquist\u2019s new album Snakes & Saints makes that point perfectly clear. Produced and engineered by multi-instrumentalists Nathan Johnson (Meaning Machine) and J. Brandon Owens (Enjoyer) at both Owens\u2019 Silent Planet studios and Johnson\u2019s home studio, it offers another example of how Blomquist culls her inspiration and sustains her intents through a resilient sense of hope, purpose and affirmation.\n\nConsisting of all original material penned by Blomquist herself, the album finds her sharing her heartfelt vocals through a delivery that\u2019s both hushed and heroic, upbeat and yet unassuming. On songs such as \u201cSecret\u201d and \u201cShape I\u2019m In,\u201d her singing literally seems to shimmer and shine. \u201cSugar\u201d finds her delivery teeming with pure pop perfection. The atmospheric ambiance of \u201cAnger\u201d belies the sentiments suggested by the title, just as the mellow drift of \u201cSorry\u201d and the distinctive dynamic of \u201cThe Bottom\u201d reflect a wisdom and endurance that conveys an inherent emotion that\u2019s bound up in each.\n\n\n*Riverbluff Performing Songwriter Grand Prize Winner (2006) for \"I Could Get Used To This\"\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2006) with \"When the Cards Are Yours\" (Folk Category)\n\n*Kerrville Folk Festival Finalist (2005)\n\n*USA Songwriting Competition Honorable Mention (2018) with C'mon Love (Americana)", "otherInfo": "Tune in as Singer-songwriter Treva Blomquist streams an acoustic concert from her home to yours via FaceBook and Instagram."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Steve Aoki ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6048342.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electronic, Indie, Alternative, Electro", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Aoki, whose father Rocky is the founder of the famous Benihana Japanese restaurant chain, and sister Devon is a famous model and actress, is one of Los Angeles' most well known DJs.\nHe founded his own record label, Dim Mak Records (which has signed such artists as Bloc Party, Whirlwind Heat, Whitey and Neon Blonde), in 1996 and has also launched a Dim Mak clothing line.

Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cordovas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9577041.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Sevans Henderson, Lucca Soria, Joe Firstman, Toby Weaver", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Rooted in triple-stacked harmonies, southern storytelling, and cosmic country twang, Cordovas create their own version of American roots-rock with That Santa Fe Channel.\n\nThe album marks the band's ATO Records debut, arriving after more than a half-decade's worth of international touring, communal living, and shared songwriting sessions. It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Workout Club ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tony Suraci Music LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9729939.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Rainbow, California", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tony Suraci\u2019s performances are purely musical with deep, honest manifestations of tone and expression.

She\u2019s dedicated the lively confessional \u201cto all who wander.\u201d\n\nFrom the album\u2019s torrid opener, \u201cLove Revolution,\u201d to the euphoric closer \u201cSong Don\u2019t Fail Me Now,\u201d The Walk demonstrates a heartfelt testament that music can absolutely heal the spirit. It\u2019s a fearless, funny, insightful Bishop we encounter on a path that found her moving from Nashville back to her native Texas, writing an album that captures a seasoned singer/songwriter rediscovering her passion and musical purpose. It\u2019s a liberating collection of songs she calls her \u201cbreakaway.\u201d \u201cThe words are from my soul and the music keeps my feet moving,\u201d says Bonnie. \u201cFor that I am most grateful.\u201d\n\nFraming each of the album\u2019s songs in one-word definitions (such as PURPOSE for \u201cLove Revolution,\u201d and DOUBT for the moving title track), Bonnie captures life\u2019s contradictions and conflicts with an unblinking, no-holding-back approach. Jordan\u2019s groove-laden production completes the compact she made with herself to flourish outside of her comfort zone. \u201cI always wanted to work with him,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew he was perfect for this project because I knew he would create lively beats that made deeper songs like this connect on an upbeat level, as well. I was taking a journey into the unknown and he was there with me every step of the way.\u201d\n\nBishop began playing original music in dive bars and honky-tonks across her native Texas after graduating from the University of Texas with a degree in Sociology. She moved to Nashville in 2008, sharpening her songwriting chops with writers Mike Reid, Jimmy Wallace, Al Anderson among others. Her big break came when Bonnie Raitt recorded a song she and Anderson wrote entitled \u201cNot Cause I Wanted To,\u201d helping snag a Grammy for Best Americana Album in 2013. In all, Bishop has recorded eight albums, rising though the country/Americana ranks and receiving various awards for her songwriting. A few years ago she decided to take a hiatus from the stress of the music business and enrolled in Sewanee University of the South, where she is currently working toward a master\u2019s degree in creative writing.\n\nIn 2016, Thirty Tigers convinced her to record a new album with producer David Cobb, the universally acclaimed Ain\u2019t Who I Was, which brought her back with a splash and showcased the more soulful side of the dynamic singer.\n\nBonnie also dedicates herself to a cause that \u201cwalks the walk\u201d when it comes to turning music into redemptive, life-changing transformation for others, and calls her work with Songwriting With Soldiers the most fulfilling part of her life as a songwriter. This non-profit organization pairs professional songwriters with veterans and active duty military, using collaborative songwriting to build creativity, connections, and strengths. Bonnie recently performed some of the songs she has written with veterans as part of a Songwriting With Soldiers PBS concert at Nashville\u2019s War Memorial Auditorium, which aired this Fall and continues to run on U.S. public access.\n\nTrack List:\nLove Revolution (written by Bonnie Bishop and Gabe Dixon)\nKeep On Movin (written by Bonnie Bishop and Gabe Dixon)\nThe Walk (written by Bonnie Bishop and Emery Dobyns)\nEvery Happiness Under The Sun (written by Bonnie Bishop and Rebecca Lynn Howard)\nI Don\u2019t Like To Be Alone (written by Bonnie Bishop)\nWomen At The Well (written by Bonnie Bishop and Rebecca Lynn Howard)\nSong Don\u2019t Fail Me Now (written by Bonnie Bishop and Gabe Dixon)\n\n\nFollow Bonnie Bishop here:\nOffiicial Website: www.bonniebishop.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/bonniebishop\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/bonniebishopforrockstar\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/BonnieBishopOfficial", "otherInfo": "Bonnie Bishop will perform a LIMITED LIVE & LIVE STREAM Band Show at Lava Cantina on THURS, May 28th at 9:00pm!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Maggie Rose LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388859.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Americana, Funk, Rock, Country, Soul, R&b", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Exceptionally versatile singer-songwriter Maggie Rose released her highly anticipated album, Change The Whole Thing, September 21, 2018.

Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "Join us LIVE on Thursday May 28th at 9pm CT for the Official \u201cHELP MYSELF\u201d Virtual Release Party, Song Premiere and Concert.

Practically from the day she was born, her father exposed her to all forms of rock & roll and other types of popular music, and she was quickly inspired to sing and play music herself.\n\nShelby began singing and took voice lessons at an early age, and at 12 was drawn to the guitar. After honing her skills throughout her youth, 16 year old Shelby began to write and perform her own music. Teaming up with a schoolmate, Shelby formed her first band, the duo Mirror Image. With Mirror Image, Shelby achieved regional acclaim as a captivating singer and performer. Their self-titled Ep was played in heavy rotation on local radio.\n\n\n\nThe Mirror Image project ended after a couple of years as her partner left for college, so Shelby jumped full on into a solo career. Building upon her reputation, Shelby began playing up and down the state and beyond. Shelby (as Shelby Lanterman) then released her solo album, Paper Thin which garnered significant critical acclaim. Whiskey Drinkin\u2019 Woman from the Paper Thin album won Best Original Song in KMOU\u2019s (New Mexico) Song Contest. The praise for the album led to her first national tour.\n\n\n\nIn forming a band for her tour, she met another singer-songwriter and formed the band Shelby, Texas. Playing a fascinating hybrid of classic and southern rock, with a bit of old time country mixed in, this band quickly surged in popularity, and in the course of 3 years, played over 500 shows in 28 states and Canada. Their EP We Are Shelby, Texas won the Best EP award from the LA Music Critics Awards in 2018. They built a very loyal audience around the country which lead to multiple tours and more and more recognition. In early 2019, the band amicably decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Shelby\u2019s new project, Shelby Ann (Ann being her middle name). This new project highlights Shelby\u2019s natural charisma and exceptional on-stage performance, with her award winning song-writing style.\n\n\n\nHer performance credits include Hollywood\u2019s Roxy Theater, the Whiskey A Go-Go, the Great American Music Hall, the Bottle Rock Festival, Sweetwater Music Hall, the Uptown Theater, Silo\u2019s, the Roswell UFO Festival and many more. As a solo artist and with Mirror Image & Shelby, Texas, Shelby has had the opportunity to open for Bob Mould, Lisa Loeb, Shooter Jennings, Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers, Reckless Kelly, Chris Trapper, Hot Club of Cowtown, among many others.\n\nInspired by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Nirvana, Shelby\u2019s songwriting style blends the angst and energy of 90\u2019s alt-rock/grunge with the sensibility of Americana and roots rock. With a wealth of her own material and a group of carefully selected covers, Shelby\u2019s high energy performances will remind you why you fell in love with rock & roll in the first place.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "HOT FLASH HEAT WAVE LIVE", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9820674.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Dream Pop, Pop, Post Punk, Psychedelic Pop, New Wave, Bedroom Pop", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "San Francisco band Hot Flash Heat Wave rose to prominence in the Bay Area music scene in 2015 with the release of their debut album Neapolitan.

He has his black-belt in voice and bottleneck guitar and his banjo playing scares the crap out of me.\u201d\n\u2013 David Lindley, musical adventurer\n\nVery few musicians of any stripe so personify a musical genre as completely as Tony Furtado embodies Americana roots music. Tony is an evocative and soulful singer, a wide-ranging songwriter and a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist adept on banjo, cello-banjo, slide guitar and baritone ukulele who mixes and matches sounds and styles with the flair of a master chef (he\u2019s also an accomplished sculptor, but that\u2019s another story). All of the music of America is in Tony\u2019s music. Relix hit the nail on the head when writing of Tony: \u201cTrue talent doesn\u2019t need categories.\u201d\n\nA native of Pleasanton, California, who now makes his home in Portland, Oregon, Tony Furtado took up the banjo at age 12, inspired by the Beverly Hillbillies TV show and a sixth grade music report. He first attracted national attention in 1987, when he won the National Bluegrass Banjo Championship in Winfield, Kansas. Not long after that, Tony opted for the life of a full-time professional musician, joining Laurie Lewis & Grant Street. A second victory at Winfield, in 1991, bookended his years with Grant Street.\n\nIn 1990, Tony signed a recording deal with Rounder Records, one of the country\u2019s preeminent independent record companies. Beginning with Swamped in 1990, he recorded six critically acclaimed albums for the label, collaborating with such master musicians as Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Tim O\u2019Brien, Stuart Duncan, Kelly Joe Phelps and Mike Marshall. During this period, Tony also performed and recorded with the band Sugarbeat and the Rounder Banjo Extravaganza with Tony Trischka and Tom Adams.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s\u2014influenced by such musical heroes as Ry Cooder, David Lindley and Taj Mahal\u2014Tony added slide guitar, singing and songwriting to his musical toolbox and began leading his own band. He is a tireless road musician who performs in a dizzying variety of formats: solo, in a duo or trio or with his full five-person band. He especially values the opportunities he has had to tour with such legendary musicians as Gregg Allman and with such esteemed slide guitarists as David Lindley, Derek Trucks and Sonny Landreth.\n\nTony has performed throughout the world at top venues and appeared at such prestigious music festivals as the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Jazz Aspen, Kerrville Folk Festival, Strawberry Music Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival and countless others. \u201cI love playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my energy is focused on the love of playing music and rolling with the moment. It\u2019s a give and take from the audience to the stage, and back. And the music that is created is something that otherwise might not occur without that flow.\u201d\n\nTony has recorded and produced almost a dozen CDs for various labels such as Dualtone, What Are Records and Funzalo Records. Tony enthusiastically describes his newest CD, The Bell, as \u201cthe most personal of my career.\u201d To be released this summer on his own YousayFurtado Records, The Bell is an important release for several reasons: it represents a return to Tony\u2019s banjo-playing roots, with the banjo and cello-banjo more prominent than in recent years; the original songs concern such weighty themes as the loss of his father, the birth of his son and his own creative rebirth with the move to a new record label and management team; his working band is featured; and, most important of all, this is the first album in a long time on which Tony had complete artistic control.

Tras sus primeros escarceos con los sonidos electr\u00f3nicos con tan s\u00f3lo 16 a\u00f1os, sus habilidades t\u00e9cnicas, su especial conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico y su amplio y diverso abanico de estilos musicales pronto le convertir\u00edan en uno de los artistas m\u00e1s vers\u00e1tiles y polivalentes de la escena nacional. Como el buen vino, De La Swing ha madurado con el paso del tiempo y su progresi\u00f3n sonora le ha catapultado hasta poder presumir de compartir tiempo y escenarios con varios de los nombres m\u00e1s importantes de la escena mundial; y es que compartir cabina junto a artistas como Marco Carola, Loco Dice , Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna o Vitalic, o actuar en festivales y eventos tan emblem\u00e1ticos y reputados como Monegros Desert Festival, Eastern Electrics Festival, Kingsday Madness, We are Together, Plages Electroniques, Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival son prueba fehaciente del asentamiento sonoro y arrollador \u00e9xito a escala mundial del madrile\u00f1o. Incorpor\u00e1ndose a la familia Row en 2010 como residente y pilar fundamental de un club como Elrow de Barcelona, la trayectoria de De La Swing ha experimentado un constante crecimiento mejorando exponencialmente y llegando a abanderar, -junto al resto de familia Row-, su residencia tambi\u00e9n en las fiestas especiales a cargo del club catal\u00e1n albergadas en Ibiza como El Row en Privilege Ibiza durante las temporadas 2012 y 2013, o un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde en Space Ibiza. De La Swing es ese tipo de artista inconformista cuya carrera y evoluci\u00f3n musical es cuidada hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle y donde la profundidad, creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n sonora se abrazan sin acritud seg\u00fan pisa el escenario. Son su pasi\u00f3n y buen rollo hacia la m\u00fasica lo que impera en su d\u00eda a d\u00eda y lo que hacen de sus sets un aut\u00e9ntico viaje sonoro y \u00fanica su conexi\u00f3n con el p\u00fablico. Y es que si el de Madrid destaca con sus sesiones desenvueltas en un constante Groove y fusionando techno y house de la nueva escuela, sus producciones van un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Con una mentalidad solida, f\u00e9rtil y arriesgada, De La Swing es el alma m\u00e1ter detr\u00e1s de labels tan en alza en el panorama nacional como Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, habiendo tambi\u00e9n colaborado y remezclado para sellos como Form, Drakos Recordings y Amazing Lab. Pero su amor por la m\u00fasica y el eclecticismo musical le ha hecho mostrar su otra cara art\u00edstica; su faceta m\u00e1s underground bajo el pseud\u00f3nimo \u2018Smoked Signal\u2019, habitualmente presente como residente del Ker Club de la Ciudad Condal y habiendo compartido vivencias y an\u00e9cdotas en su escenario con nombres como Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba o Los Suruba entre otros. English version: Born in Madrid in the 80\u2019s, Domingo Bellot starts his musical career at the age of 16. Influenced in its beginnings by techno and drum&bass, his technical skills, ability to connect with the crowd and he\u2019s diverse musical style has made him one of the most versatile DJ\u00b4s in Spain. Over the past 5 years De La Swing has shared turntables with different top level Djs as Marco Carola, Loco Dice, Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Laurent Garnier, Joseph Capriati, Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch, Paco Osuna or Vitalic among others, and has played at festivals like Monegros Desert Festival (Spain), Eastern Electric Festival (London), Kingsday Madness (Holland), We are Together (Marseille), Plages Electroniques (Cannes), Ultra Cape Town/Johannesburg & Origin Festival (South Africa), resulting rapidly a well-known and familiar Dj in countries as Spain, France, Italy and Holland. Since 2010 this Madrid born is one of the emblematic ElRow residents, the after hour based in the ever growing electronic hub of Barcelona, that has become one of the best clubs worldwide, brainchild of the organisers of Europe's only desert festival, Monegros, and owners of the acclaimed techno club Florida 135 in Fraga, Huesca. Equally important are his recent El Row residencies during the summer season in Privilege Ibiza -in 2012 and 2013- and Space Ibiza in 2014. De la Swing is that type of non-conformist artist which lives in a continuous sound evolution, where the depth, darkness and fun are always present in his sets and throughout which he shows his creativity and innovation on stage, driving his passion and vibrancy to create a different story every time, while establishing a unique connection with the crowd. While in the studio, De la Swing is a solid and fertile mind being in charge of different labels as Elrow Music, Florida Music & Ker Recordings, having also produced and remixed for labels like Form, Drakos Recordings and Amazing Lab. However, his skills and abilities go further on. We can also enjoy its more underground side with his aka \u2018Smoke Signal\u2019, usually as resident in Ker Club Barcelona once a month, sharing his talent with artists such as Martinez Brothers, Art Department, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Seth Troxler, Scuba or Los Suruba.

Summoning a thrilling spirit, with throwback sonic crunch, visual flair, and reckless live performances, PALAYE ROYALE has quickly earned a legion of obsessive cult-like loyalists, lovingly dubbed Soldiers of the Royal Council. PALAYE ROYALE draw as much inspiration from cinema and philosophy as they do from their musical muses, building a story with libertine reverence for Alan Watts and debauchery-fueled nights at the Chateau Marmont, for Johnny Thunders and The Stooges. This band is equally at home in the hallways of Los Angeles Fashion Week or climbing the lighting tresses at the Vans Warped Tour. They sold out theaters on their first-ever headlining tour and steal the show at each major festival.\nEach member of PALAYE ROYALE doubles as musician and visionary. The Pirate, The Vampire, and The Gentleman inspire a level of devotion reserved for My Chemical Romance or Twenty One Pilots, as their deep fan connection crosses genre-divides.\nKerrang! declared the band to be \u201con the cusp of next-level stardom\u201d and with good reason.

Boom Boom Room (Side A) paved the way for this year\u2019s hotly- anticipated follow-up, Boom Boom Room (Side B), heralded by the arrival of the overnight smash lead single, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Fine.\u201d PALAYE ROYALE brought the juxtaposition of the glitz and grime of their teenage years spent in Las Vegas, when they relocated to Los Angeles in 2011. The ghost of Charlie Chaplin was surely some sort of unseen guide as they took up residence in his old home and rehearsed continuously in a basement. By the time they hit the road, borrowing their mother\u2019s Cadillac Escalade, Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett were a tightly wound creative force. (Not long ago, they slept in that SUV outside a Motel 6, unable to afford to rent a room.)\nIt was Alex Burdon, daughter of The Animals singer Eric Burdon, who insisted Sumerian\u2019s founder see the band. (The label offered them a contract the same night.) Los Angeles radio personality and tastemaker Rodney Bingenheimer introduced PALAYE ROYALE to rock industry legend Kim Fowley, another strong supporter. James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins/A Perfect Circle and Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour also count themselves among the band\u2019s true believers, having worked with them as a producer and taken them out on tour, respectively. Sleeping With Sirens\u2019 Kellin Quinn made a guest appearance on Boom Boom Room (Side A). As their moniker itself evokes (Palaye Royale is the name of the Toronto dancehall where their grandparents met in the \u201850s), the brotherly trio is eager to connect themselves and this generation to the spirit of the past, but reinvigorated for today with eclecticism and fierce individuality. Their tours are like a traveling circus. Clad in scarves, hats, paisley shirts, and makeup, as the Soldiers of the Royal Council attest, it\u2019s the PALAYE ROYALE lifestyle. Gretsch guitar tones that shimmer with reverb, drums that shake and pound, vocals that claw forth with the electric urgency of the early punk movement, all swirling together with the swinging cool of the 1960s and the swagger of latter day Brit Pop bands such as The Libertines and early Arctic Monkeys. Each show comes with an element of unpredictability and danger, with the three guys playing as if their lives depended on it, pure showmanship over perfectionism.\nAs Classic Rock Magazine wrote, \u201cIf you want theatrics, these boys deliver in spades \u2013 and not just in their headline-grabbing threads and eye-popping stage show.\u201d The Rolling Stones, The Black Crowes, and The Doors collide with The Ramones and Iggy Pop within their songs, with a hint of the early blues that inspired Led Zeppelin. It\u2019s fast-paced dirty rock n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s glam and grime, spectacle and sweat, showmanship and songwriting. Rock Sound\u2019s in-depth cover story, drawn from an intense 72-hours with the brothers, called PALAYE ROYALE \u201cRock\u2019s Next Superstars,\u201d predicting they \u201cmight just change it all.\u201d Even as 2016\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side A) and 2018\u2019s Boom Boom Room (Side B) document the story thus far, PALAYE ROYALE remain focused on the bigger picture. They\u2019ve built something grander than a band. It\u2019s an artistic movement. Ever self- assured in their ambition and staunch in their support of individuality, PALAYE ROYALE are \u201coutfitting the revolution\u201d (as they like to say).", "otherInfo": "Tonight at 9:05pm PT we\u2019ll be celebrating the release of \u201cThe Bastards\u201d with an Instagram Live listening party.\n\nChoose your favorite streaming platform (ex.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair. With all this in mind, Solardo will go into 2020 as one of dance music\u2019s truly premiere names.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dubfire ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10247989.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Washington, District of Columbia", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "From global success in the commercial domain, to equal accomplishments within the underground scene, Dubfire (aka Ali Shirazinia) is an artist whose drive, talent and intuition have placed him in the top tier of electronic music artists in the world. He maintains this position within the industry with an unrelenting work ethic and a determination to innovate, evolve, and entertain. Whether it\u2019s his involvement with Deep Dish, his solo performances at an extensive list of the world\u2019s most influential clubs and festivals, his dubfire:live HYBRID show, running his label SCI+TEC, or simply his exploration of audio and visual technology, Dubfire is in a class of his own.\n\nBorn in Iran and raised in the U.S. from the age of seven, Ali first developed his skills playing at local clubs in Washington, D.C. He was introduced to Sharam Tayebi through a childhood friend and they formed Deep Dish; a production and DJ duo that conquered the world of electronic music, picking up a Grammy in the process, in addition to a vast array of other awards and accolades. At the height of their success both opted to take a step back and pursue solo careers, with the Dubfire alias allowing him to express his deep love for underground house and techno which formed the backbone of his foray into electronic music. Despite skepticism from certain quarters within the industry, Dubfire quickly integrated himself into the minimalistic techno scene and produced several key releases that cemented him as a true visionary and a force to be reckoned with. From \u2018Ribcage,\u2019 \u2018Emissions\u2019 and \u2018Roadkill,\u2019 to his work with Oliver Huntemann and his remix of \u2018Spastik\u2019 by Plastikman, Dubfire\u2019s creations perfectly display his musical dexterity and depth of aural knowledge. His iconic remix of Radio Slave and Danton Eeeprom\u2019s \u2018Grindhouse\u2019 is considered one of the most enduring and influential markers of his signature sound, as well as a bona fide techno classic.\n\nHis ascent was swift and assured, taking him to the upper echelons of the techno sphere. A fascination with technology and its implementation within both the studio and on stage put Dubfire in a unique position. As someone who performs with an array of equipment, he has advanced the role of the DJ from someone who mixes records, to an individual who manipulates and creates new music on the fly, further blurring the boundaries between DJ and live performer. This ad-lib style leads to a constantly exhilarating, unpredictable show and demonstrates his penchant for technology.\n\nNow splitting his time between Los Angeles, Washington D.C and Barcelona, Dubfire travels on a regular basis, spreading his sound from Brazil to Japan, and everywhere in between. From Warung in Itajai to Womb in Tokyo to DC10 in Ibiza, Dubfire has performed at nearly every club, festival and event worldwide.\n\nNever satisfied with the status quo, Dubfire spent two years crafting a live show; his HYBRID concept has been wowing audiences since its soft launch debut at the Amsterdam Dance Event in 2014. Described by Thump as, \u201cunlike anything we had previously seen or heard before anywhere,\u201d HYBRID reinvents the concert experience by seamlessly weaving together elements of 2D and 3D animation with live audio and lighting to explore the intersection of science and technology - of man and machine - and their resulting evolution and inevitable fusion. After touring 12 different countries in 2015, the critically acclaimed show will touch down at more of the biggest events across the globe including Coachella, Movement and IMS in 2016.\n\nDubfire reunited with Sharam in 2014 to take Deep Dish back on the road for a limited run, cultivating a batch of new material and a scintillating production and visual show to match. As the duo explained to The Miami New Times, \"we\u2019ve come back to together to tell the rest of the story.\" The continuation of this story involves an album project, a comprehensive world tour, as well as an extensive retrospective package of their stellar past work.\n\nDubfire\u2019s story is also set to be told through a documentary; titled \u201cAbove Ground Level\u201d. The film chronicles his career trajectory from fleeing Iran as a youngster to becoming one of the biggest electronic music stars on the planet. Telling a human story of an immigrant in pursuit of the American dream, the film steers clear of past electronic music cliches and gives an in depth look at the hard work and sacrifice needed to become a success within the electronic music scene. Featuring honest contributions from his closest friends and family, along with peers such as David Guetta, Richie Hawtin, Pete Tong, and Carl Cox, it reinforces his stellar achievements and gives an inside look into Dubfire\u2019s journey.\n\nDubfire continues to push the envelope and challenge himself, with 2016 marking a major milestone for the constantly evolving artist who will celebrate a decade as a solo artist. He is set to kick off the North American leg of his dubfire:live HYBRID tour where he will headline a stage at the Coachella Music Festival.\n\n\nCONNECT\ndubfire.com\nFacebook/com/dubfire\nTwitter.com/dubfire\nsoundcloud.com/dubfire\nyoutube.com/dubfiretouring\ninstagram.com/dubfire", "otherInfo": "Tronic turns 25 this year and since we are not able to celebrate with all of you on our scheduled label showcases around the world we invite you to our Virtual Anniversary in collaboration with Beatport."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "P.Will ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Spartaque ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8485084.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Techno", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ukrainian DJ and Producer Spartaque has become a name known for raw quality on the international techno landscape.

At sixteen she began performing in bars in Salvador da Bahia and discovered that her calling in life was music. Her passion for Bahian Carnaval led to the ultimate challenge of singing in a trio el\u00e9trico. Mercury took to the rolling, amplified bandstand that lumbers down the avenue among Carnaval revelers at a time in which only men sang in blocos. Since then the festa barroca has become her milieu of choice for redefining her artistry. A performer of exceptional magnetism who emphasizes creativity, responsibility, and social commitment, excellence and originality in her work, Mercury comfortably navigates musical diversity with the infectious energy and joy of being a Baiana. Her tours and concerts around the world have transformed her into an ambassador for Brazilian music. She sold more than 10 million albums wordwide and is one of the best selling female artists in Brazil.\n\nCareer\n\nDaniela Mercury formed the pop group Companhia Clic and recorded her first two albums. Pega que Oh! and Ilha das Bananas became hit singles in the late 80s. Mercury\u2019s first studio efforts paved the way for her incursion into electronic music, placing her at the forefront of what lay ahead.\n\nHer first solo project (1991), released by independent record company Eldorado, announced the arrival of a sound that conquered Brazil. The single Swing da Cor became the most played song on Bahian airwaves. From there it rippled into the rest of the northeastern region and resonated in southern and southeastern Brazil. Today Swing da Cor is synonymous with samba-reggae, a genre rooted in the Afro-blocos of Bahia (dancing groups that act as afro-centric vehicles of racial identity) and directly influenced by the ceremonial drumming used in the African-derived religious rituals of Candombl\u00e9.\n\n\nDaniela Mercury\u2019s first live concert (1992) in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Museum of Art consolidated her popularity onstage. The midday performance attracted more than twenty thousand people who spilled into the avenue, interrupting the flow of traffic.\n\n1992\u2019s Canto da Cidade (Sony) emerged just as Brazil was experiencing the enthrallment of having discovered a new star. The single that gave the album its title became a number one hit and stayed in that position for months. The LP broke sales records, giving Mercury the distinction of being the first artist to receive a diamond record for having sold a million copies. Its success is so impressive that many years have passed since its release, yet Canto da Cidade continues to sell, having already surpassed the three million mark in Brazil and abroad. Canto da Cidade sparked a special on Rede Globo, shows throughout Europe and the United States, magazine covers, and hundreds of interviews. Its success was crowned by shows throughout Brazil boasting a record number of attendants that reached more than two million concertgoers.\n\nMercury\u2019s next album, M\u00fasica de Rua (1994-Sony), proved that the singer was no fleeting sensation. The record established her versatility as a composer and arranger and more frequent domestic and international tours consecrated her as a top-notch performer. Singing in Portuguese for an international audience was not a setback for Mercury. In response to the perceived language barrier she once countered: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a Brazilian artist who has less difficulty expressing what I do on an international level. While my audience may not understand what I sing they certainly feel the joy and energy coming from my music and sing along.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Mercury continued to delight audiences with Feij\u00e3o com Arroz (1996-Sony), and won over critics for good. Given her unabated popularity with audiences, skeptics recognized the artist\u2019s musical consistency. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz explored the range of Samba music in its sundry phases, paying homage to Brazil\u2019s musical and ethnic roots with arrangements that showcased the modern pop sensibilities present in the most traditional of rhythms. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz was a landmark album in Mercury\u2019s career, especially in the international market.\n\nFinally in 1998 Mercury released her first live album, El\u00e9trica (Sony), in response to the public\u2019s overwhelming demand of having the electrifying atmosphere of her shows preserved on disc. Recorded in her stronghold, Salvador, Mercury blended the Bahian guitar typically used in the trios el\u00e9tricos during Carnaval with electric rock guitar. The album\u2019s repertoire included hits from previous records, including Swing da Cor, O Canto da Cidade, M\u00fasica de Rua, Rapunzel, Nobre Vagabundo, among others, and songs she had performed live but never recorded. Additionally Mercury included five new songs on the album, four of which were either penned solely by the artist or in partnership with other songwriters.\n\nSol da Liberdade (2000-BMG) reaffirmed Mercury\u2019s affinity for the samba-reggae hybrid. The single Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra registered as one of Mercury\u2019s most beautiful renditions. The artist\u2019s newest challenge, hailed as her best album yet, surprised fans and critics alike. Joining forces with Suba (an acclaimed producer in Brazilian electronica), Mercury mixed the drumbeats of samba-reggae with sounds extracted from electronic music (rap, funk, lounge, house), in a harmonious, if unlikely union.\n\nSou de Qualquer Lugar (2001-BMG) brought together prominent songwriters such as Lenine, Gilberto Gil and Carlinhos Brown and showcased a remake of Rita Lee\u2019s Mutante and an electrifying version of the late Chico Science\u2019s Praieira. Electronic samba-reggae frames the album for the most part, though Mercury\u2019s most intimate and feminine side permeates throughout, from the album art to the compositions and her renditions of the songs.\n\nEletrodom\u00e9stico \u2013 MTV Live (2003-BMG) was recorded during a show at the Castro Alves Theater\u2019s Concha Ac\u00fastica in Salvador and released on CD and DVD. By inviting Portuguese singer Dulce Pontes, flamenco pop sensation Ros\u00e1rio Flores, Italian rapper Lorenzo Jovanotti, Bahian percussionist Carlinhos Brown, along with the bands Olodum, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, and Hip Hop Roots to join her onstage, the show became a high point on the multicultural scale of Mercury\u2019s career.\n\nIn Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico (2004-BMG), Daniela invited the most important DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine, to participate in a commemorative disc celebrating five years of her having formed TrioTechno, the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music to parade in Bahia\u2019s Carnaval. The album is a fusion of a panoply of electronic musical expressions, including Drum\u2019n Bass, House, Techno, Lounge, and Dub with Brazilian rhythms that result in original song creations. The disc subsequently received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a Tim award for best female pop/rock vocals. Internet users voted Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil\u2019s most important weekly magazines Revista Isto \u00c9.\n\nIn 2005 Mercury released Cl\u00e1ssica (Som Livre) on CD and DVD. Recorded from a show she gave the year before at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo - Bourbon Street the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and remakes of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) hits. The recording signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from multinational record companies to gain full control of her music.\n\nThe year 2005 also saw the release of Bal\u00e9 Mulato (EMI). Produced by Mercury, Ramiro Musotto, and Al\u00ea Siqueira, the album is percussive, vibrant, and contemporary. On it Mercury draws from samba-reggae, rock, frevo (a hybrid of martial polka and African rhythms played mostly during Recife Carnaval), galope eletr\u00f4nico (the electronic version of a northeastern rhythm that imitates the gallop of a horse), and romantic ballads.\n\nBaile Barroco (2006-EMI) is the first live DVD of Mercury performing in a trio el\u00e9trico during the 2005 Bahian Carnaval. The collection of songs celebrates twenty years of ax\u00e9-music with quest performers Luis Caldas, Fernanda Porto, Banda Kaleidosc\u00f3pio and Ramiro Musotto. A highlight that exemplified Bahian Carnaval\u2019s history of diversity was when Mercury opened the parade with a baby grand piano set up on an ample stage. Accompanied by Ricardo Castro on piano, Mercury sang Ary Barroso\u2019s Aquarela do Brasil, Villa Lobos\u2019 Bachianas n.5, and some Bach, in a performance that enchanted millions of revelers at the Barra-Ondina circuit and demonstrated the singer\u2019s boldness and inimitability.\n\nPresent\n\noday Mercury has sold more than ten million albums around the globe. She was the only Brazilian artist invited to participate in the recording of a DVD celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Cirque de Soleil. In 2004 she was invited to commemorate the Montreal International Jazz Fesitval\u2019s 25th anniversary and was a special guest on Alejandro Sanz\u2019s latest DVD, with whom she sang a duet in a bullfighting ring in Madrid. Mercury has sung with the greatest names in Brazilian music and in popular music abroad. Legends such as Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Paul McCartney and Ray Charles stand out.\n\nThe artistic vitality of Daniela Mercury\u2019s musical trajectory is reflected in the fact that all of her albums have produced national hits and many of her songs have been included in soap opera soundtracks.\n\nToday Mercury is the star of bloco Crocodilo, headlining the Barra-Ondina circuit, which was created as an alternative space in an area in the center of the city that was drawing large crowds during Carnaval. From the time Mercury began parading in 1996 down the Avenue the winds along the seashore, later setting up her own camarote (boxes along the parade route), the circuit became official. Today it attracts hundreds of thousands of revelers in the same way the former Seventh Avenue circuit did in the past.\n\nThe celebration of Carnaval is a backdrop to Mercury\u2019s success on stage and in the studio. For many years she was chosen best Carnaval singer and some of her hits were named best Carnaval themed music, sang by other artists and blocos.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "SALADIN ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10024819.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Tech House, House, Future House, Bass House", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dubbed \u201cChicago\u2019s Ghetto Rockstar\u201d by Iconic Underground Magazine, SALADIN (pronounced Sah-lay-din) is growing at a rapid pace with many releases on prominent dance imprints.\n\nsaladin.mgmt@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chow Mane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8131566.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Hip-hop", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chinese rapper and dumpling whisperer", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DRUNKEN KONG\uff08OFFICIAL\uff09 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6906039.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Techno, Electronic", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Drunken Kong is the moniker of D.Singh.

He trusts on his remarkable talent as a producer and live act\u2014no added artificial flashiness needed. He can rave with the best of them, and raise his arms to full dancefloor delirium, but his head will never spin right off.\n\nPaul Kalkbrenner's demanding compositions are full of energy; they exist to take listeners away from the everyday, from the weekly grind, into rapture\u2014into art, ecstasy, absurdity friendship, hope and love.\n\nJust 12 years old when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Kalkbrenner watched as East Berlin became an anarchic playground for a previously oppressed generation, recently freed from an overbearing state. Techno music became a way of expression and for many, Paul included, the soundtrack of Germany's reunification. In the autumn of 1992, together with his friend Sascha Funke, he started DJing at local youth clubs. Very quickly Paul and Sascha were either DJing or obsessively collecting records as electronic dance music's first tidal wave spilled over dance floors in Berlin's soon-to-be legendary clubs Tresor, Planet, Walfisch and e-werk.\n\nAt 18, he took a job at German television, spending his days sitting and editing suites watching as staid German political parties held national conferences. This would make him enough money to buy equipment to produce his own tracks. As much fun as DJing was, Paul wanted to play his own music live.\n\nHis first tracks were released on Ellen Allien's newly founded Bpitch Control label in 1999. In contrast to the darker, monotone sounds that characterized techno at the time, Paul's music was more melodic and enriched with a warm, dubby feel. After a number of 12\" singles, Paul realised he was better suited producing albums. In 2000, he released \u2018Superimpose\u2019, followed by \u2018Zeit\u2019 one year later. His third album, \u2018Self\u2019 from 2004, resonated beyond the dancefloor and took the cinematic quality of his music to new heights\u2014an indication of what was to come next.\n\nIn 2004, Berlin-based film director and self-confessed Kalkbrenner fan, Hannes Stoehr, got in touch with Paul. He was planning to make a movie about an electronic musician in Berlin's techno scene and wanted Paul to produce the soundtrack. As the script for the film developed, Hannes suggested Paul might be perfect in the starring role.\n\nTogether with his old friend Sascha Funke, he moved to Aix en Provence for six months. There, far away from Berlin's dreary winter, Paul produced some of his most diverse and mature compositions yet, which would later make up the soundtrack for \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019. He started shooting the movie upon his return to Berlin, with the result being an unconventional but outstanding performance. Somewhere between Paul Kalkbrenner and his character Ickarus, an intimate dialogue developed between actor and audience.\n\n\u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 became a surprise hit, and a German cult movie in its own right. It drew audiences all around Europe and stayed on the big screen at Berlin's Central Kino for several years. The soundtrack went platinum and the single \"Sky and Sand\", featuring his brother Fritz Kalkbrenner's vocals, spent over 121 weeks in the German singles charts\u2014a German record.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Paul split with his longtime label Bpitch Control to form his own independent imprint, Paul Kalkbrenner Musik. A sold-out European tour and a documentary followed. Made with the help of the \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019 team, Max Penzel and Hannes Stoehr, \u20182010 - A Live Documentary\u2019 featured an 8-camera shoot of 15 live shows, with computer graphics created by Pfadfinderei (who also worked on \u2018Berlin Calling\u2019). The documentary remains an intimate insight into Paul's life on the road, sprinkled with his dry, deadpan humour.\n\nBetween June 2011 and November 2012 Paul released his fifth and sixth studio albums \u2018Icke Wieder\u2019 and \u2018Guten Tag\u2019. These two self-released albums are Paul's bestselling albums yet\u2014both went top five in his native Germany, with \u2018Guten Tag also topping the charts in Switzerland.\n\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Paul returned to the studio soon after, but this time made a conscious decision to take his time and explore new avenues of his sound. While working on new tracks, flipping samples and experimenting, Germany's Federal Government asked him to play a headlining live show in front of the Brandenburg Gate in a historic ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was another milestone moment in Paul's career. The framed thank-you note he received from the Government afterwards has a special place in his apartment.\n\nAfter 15 years of releasing on independent labels (ten years at Bpitch Control and five on his own label), Paul decided to take the next step and signed a long-term deal with Sony International/Columbia in March 2015. Enthused by this new chapter in his career and incited by the pressure a deal like this is usually accompanied by, Paul went back to his studio to finish his seventh studio album and create a new live show.\n\nThe album, aptly titled \u20187\u2019, was released through Columbia Records in August 2015, and it saw Paul work with vocals for the first time since his chart-topping, record-breaking single \"Sky and Sand\". In an unprecedented move by the label, Sony and Columbia provided him total access to their Legacy vaults, allowing him to incorporate vocals from previously-unsampled music icons Luther Vandross and Jefferson Airplane. The album was a success across Europe, hitting No. 1 on the charts in Austria, Switzerland, and his native Germany; and earning plaudits from the New York Times, Village Voice, Mixmag, and others.\n\nFollowing \u20187\u2019\u2019s success, Paul continued to blaze new milestones, becoming the first techno artist to grace long-running European institution Tomorrowland\u2019s main stage in July 2016. At the end of the day, though, he always comes back to his underground Berlin roots, which he celebrated with his \u201cBack to the Future\u201d mixtape series, a trilogy that chronicles his personal history of electronic music\u2019s arrival to Germany as heard on the radio during his teenage years. The series went viral, amassing over 490K downloads and 502K streams, prompting rumors of a live experience in 2017.", "otherInfo": "Join me this Friday 5pm CET for Studiosession #2.

At sixteen she began performing in bars in Salvador da Bahia and discovered that her calling in life was music. Her passion for Bahian Carnaval led to the ultimate challenge of singing in a trio el\u00e9trico. Mercury took to the rolling, amplified bandstand that lumbers down the avenue among Carnaval revelers at a time in which only men sang in blocos. Since then the festa barroca has become her milieu of choice for redefining her artistry. A performer of exceptional magnetism who emphasizes creativity, responsibility, and social commitment, excellence and originality in her work, Mercury comfortably navigates musical diversity with the infectious energy and joy of being a Baiana. Her tours and concerts around the world have transformed her into an ambassador for Brazilian music. She sold more than 10 million albums wordwide and is one of the best selling female artists in Brazil.\n\nCareer\n\nDaniela Mercury formed the pop group Companhia Clic and recorded her first two albums. Pega que Oh! and Ilha das Bananas became hit singles in the late 80s. Mercury\u2019s first studio efforts paved the way for her incursion into electronic music, placing her at the forefront of what lay ahead.\n\nHer first solo project (1991), released by independent record company Eldorado, announced the arrival of a sound that conquered Brazil. The single Swing da Cor became the most played song on Bahian airwaves. From there it rippled into the rest of the northeastern region and resonated in southern and southeastern Brazil. Today Swing da Cor is synonymous with samba-reggae, a genre rooted in the Afro-blocos of Bahia (dancing groups that act as afro-centric vehicles of racial identity) and directly influenced by the ceremonial drumming used in the African-derived religious rituals of Candombl\u00e9.\n\n\nDaniela Mercury\u2019s first live concert (1992) in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Museum of Art consolidated her popularity onstage. The midday performance attracted more than twenty thousand people who spilled into the avenue, interrupting the flow of traffic.\n\n1992\u2019s Canto da Cidade (Sony) emerged just as Brazil was experiencing the enthrallment of having discovered a new star. The single that gave the album its title became a number one hit and stayed in that position for months. The LP broke sales records, giving Mercury the distinction of being the first artist to receive a diamond record for having sold a million copies. Its success is so impressive that many years have passed since its release, yet Canto da Cidade continues to sell, having already surpassed the three million mark in Brazil and abroad. Canto da Cidade sparked a special on Rede Globo, shows throughout Europe and the United States, magazine covers, and hundreds of interviews. Its success was crowned by shows throughout Brazil boasting a record number of attendants that reached more than two million concertgoers.\n\nMercury\u2019s next album, M\u00fasica de Rua (1994-Sony), proved that the singer was no fleeting sensation. The record established her versatility as a composer and arranger and more frequent domestic and international tours consecrated her as a top-notch performer. Singing in Portuguese for an international audience was not a setback for Mercury. In response to the perceived language barrier she once countered: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a Brazilian artist who has less difficulty expressing what I do on an international level. While my audience may not understand what I sing they certainly feel the joy and energy coming from my music and sing along.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Mercury continued to delight audiences with Feij\u00e3o com Arroz (1996-Sony), and won over critics for good. Given her unabated popularity with audiences, skeptics recognized the artist\u2019s musical consistency. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz explored the range of Samba music in its sundry phases, paying homage to Brazil\u2019s musical and ethnic roots with arrangements that showcased the modern pop sensibilities present in the most traditional of rhythms. Feij\u00e3o com Arroz was a landmark album in Mercury\u2019s career, especially in the international market.\n\nFinally in 1998 Mercury released her first live album, El\u00e9trica (Sony), in response to the public\u2019s overwhelming demand of having the electrifying atmosphere of her shows preserved on disc. Recorded in her stronghold, Salvador, Mercury blended the Bahian guitar typically used in the trios el\u00e9tricos during Carnaval with electric rock guitar. The album\u2019s repertoire included hits from previous records, including Swing da Cor, O Canto da Cidade, M\u00fasica de Rua, Rapunzel, Nobre Vagabundo, among others, and songs she had performed live but never recorded. Additionally Mercury included five new songs on the album, four of which were either penned solely by the artist or in partnership with other songwriters.\n\nSol da Liberdade (2000-BMG) reaffirmed Mercury\u2019s affinity for the samba-reggae hybrid. The single Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra registered as one of Mercury\u2019s most beautiful renditions. The artist\u2019s newest challenge, hailed as her best album yet, surprised fans and critics alike. Joining forces with Suba (an acclaimed producer in Brazilian electronica), Mercury mixed the drumbeats of samba-reggae with sounds extracted from electronic music (rap, funk, lounge, house), in a harmonious, if unlikely union.\n\nSou de Qualquer Lugar (2001-BMG) brought together prominent songwriters such as Lenine, Gilberto Gil and Carlinhos Brown and showcased a remake of Rita Lee\u2019s Mutante and an electrifying version of the late Chico Science\u2019s Praieira. Electronic samba-reggae frames the album for the most part, though Mercury\u2019s most intimate and feminine side permeates throughout, from the album art to the compositions and her renditions of the songs.\n\nEletrodom\u00e9stico \u2013 MTV Live (2003-BMG) was recorded during a show at the Castro Alves Theater\u2019s Concha Ac\u00fastica in Salvador and released on CD and DVD. By inviting Portuguese singer Dulce Pontes, flamenco pop sensation Ros\u00e1rio Flores, Italian rapper Lorenzo Jovanotti, Bahian percussionist Carlinhos Brown, along with the bands Olodum, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, and Hip Hop Roots to join her onstage, the show became a high point on the multicultural scale of Mercury\u2019s career.\n\nIn Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico (2004-BMG), Daniela invited the most important DJs and producers of electronic music in Brazil, as well as Gilberto Gil, Carlinhos Brown, and Lenine, to participate in a commemorative disc celebrating five years of her having formed TrioTechno, the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music to parade in Bahia\u2019s Carnaval. The album is a fusion of a panoply of electronic musical expressions, including Drum\u2019n Bass, House, Techno, Lounge, and Dub with Brazilian rhythms that result in original song creations. The disc subsequently received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a Tim award for best female pop/rock vocals. Internet users voted Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil\u2019s most important weekly magazines Revista Isto \u00c9.\n\nIn 2005 Mercury released Cl\u00e1ssica (Som Livre) on CD and DVD. Recorded from a show she gave the year before at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo - Bourbon Street the album is a sampler of bossa nova, jazz, and remakes of MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) hits. The recording signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from multinational record companies to gain full control of her music.\n\nThe year 2005 also saw the release of Bal\u00e9 Mulato (EMI). Produced by Mercury, Ramiro Musotto, and Al\u00ea Siqueira, the album is percussive, vibrant, and contemporary. On it Mercury draws from samba-reggae, rock, frevo (a hybrid of martial polka and African rhythms played mostly during Recife Carnaval), galope eletr\u00f4nico (the electronic version of a northeastern rhythm that imitates the gallop of a horse), and romantic ballads.\n\nBaile Barroco (2006-EMI) is the first live DVD of Mercury performing in a trio el\u00e9trico during the 2005 Bahian Carnaval. The collection of songs celebrates twenty years of ax\u00e9-music with quest performers Luis Caldas, Fernanda Porto, Banda Kaleidosc\u00f3pio and Ramiro Musotto. A highlight that exemplified Bahian Carnaval\u2019s history of diversity was when Mercury opened the parade with a baby grand piano set up on an ample stage. Accompanied by Ricardo Castro on piano, Mercury sang Ary Barroso\u2019s Aquarela do Brasil, Villa Lobos\u2019 Bachianas n.5, and some Bach, in a performance that enchanted millions of revelers at the Barra-Ondina circuit and demonstrated the singer\u2019s boldness and inimitability.\n\nPresent\n\noday Mercury has sold more than ten million albums around the globe. She was the only Brazilian artist invited to participate in the recording of a DVD celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Cirque de Soleil. In 2004 she was invited to commemorate the Montreal International Jazz Fesitval\u2019s 25th anniversary and was a special guest on Alejandro Sanz\u2019s latest DVD, with whom she sang a duet in a bullfighting ring in Madrid. Mercury has sung with the greatest names in Brazilian music and in popular music abroad. Legends such as Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Paul McCartney and Ray Charles stand out.\n\nThe artistic vitality of Daniela Mercury\u2019s musical trajectory is reflected in the fact that all of her albums have produced national hits and many of her songs have been included in soap opera soundtracks.\n\nToday Mercury is the star of bloco Crocodilo, headlining the Barra-Ondina circuit, which was created as an alternative space in an area in the center of the city that was drawing large crowds during Carnaval.

He maintains this position within the industry with an unrelenting work ethic and a determination to innovate, evolve, and entertain. Whether it\u2019s his involvement with Deep Dish, his solo performances at an extensive list of the world\u2019s most influential clubs and festivals, his dubfire:live HYBRID show, running his label SCI+TEC, or simply his exploration of audio and visual technology, Dubfire is in a class of his own.\n\nBorn in Iran and raised in the U.S. from the age of seven, Ali first developed his skills playing at local clubs in Washington, D.C. He was introduced to Sharam Tayebi through a childhood friend and they formed Deep Dish; a production and DJ duo that conquered the world of electronic music, picking up a Grammy in the process, in addition to a vast array of other awards and accolades. At the height of their success both opted to take a step back and pursue solo careers, with the Dubfire alias allowing him to express his deep love for underground house and techno which formed the backbone of his foray into electronic music. Despite skepticism from certain quarters within the industry, Dubfire quickly integrated himself into the minimalistic techno scene and produced several key releases that cemented him as a true visionary and a force to be reckoned with. From \u2018Ribcage,\u2019 \u2018Emissions\u2019 and \u2018Roadkill,\u2019 to his work with Oliver Huntemann and his remix of \u2018Spastik\u2019 by Plastikman, Dubfire\u2019s creations perfectly display his musical dexterity and depth of aural knowledge. His iconic remix of Radio Slave and Danton Eeeprom\u2019s \u2018Grindhouse\u2019 is considered one of the most enduring and influential markers of his signature sound, as well as a bona fide techno classic.\n\nHis ascent was swift and assured, taking him to the upper echelons of the techno sphere. A fascination with technology and its implementation within both the studio and on stage put Dubfire in a unique position. As someone who performs with an array of equipment, he has advanced the role of the DJ from someone who mixes records, to an individual who manipulates and creates new music on the fly, further blurring the boundaries between DJ and live performer. This ad-lib style leads to a constantly exhilarating, unpredictable show and demonstrates his penchant for technology.\n\nNow splitting his time between Los Angeles, Washington D.C and Barcelona, Dubfire travels on a regular basis, spreading his sound from Brazil to Japan, and everywhere in between. From Warung in Itajai to Womb in Tokyo to DC10 in Ibiza, Dubfire has performed at nearly every club, festival and event worldwide.\n\nNever satisfied with the status quo, Dubfire spent two years crafting a live show; his HYBRID concept has been wowing audiences since its soft launch debut at the Amsterdam Dance Event in 2014. Described by Thump as, \u201cunlike anything we had previously seen or heard before anywhere,\u201d HYBRID reinvents the concert experience by seamlessly weaving together elements of 2D and 3D animation with live audio and lighting to explore the intersection of science and technology - of man and machine - and their resulting evolution and inevitable fusion. After touring 12 different countries in 2015, the critically acclaimed show will touch down at more of the biggest events across the globe including Coachella, Movement and IMS in 2016.\n\nDubfire reunited with Sharam in 2014 to take Deep Dish back on the road for a limited run, cultivating a batch of new material and a scintillating production and visual show to match. As the duo explained to The Miami New Times, \"we\u2019ve come back to together to tell the rest of the story.\" The continuation of this story involves an album project, a comprehensive world tour, as well as an extensive retrospective package of their stellar past work.\n\nDubfire\u2019s story is also set to be told through a documentary; titled \u201cAbove Ground Level\u201d. The film chronicles his career trajectory from fleeing Iran as a youngster to becoming one of the biggest electronic music stars on the planet. Telling a human story of an immigrant in pursuit of the American dream, the film steers clear of past electronic music cliches and gives an in depth look at the hard work and sacrifice needed to become a success within the electronic music scene. Featuring honest contributions from his closest friends and family, along with peers such as David Guetta, Richie Hawtin, Pete Tong, and Carl Cox, it reinforces his stellar achievements and gives an inside look into Dubfire\u2019s journey.\n\nDubfire continues to push the envelope and challenge himself, with 2016 marking a major milestone for the constantly evolving artist who will celebrate a decade as a solo artist. He is set to kick off the North American leg of his dubfire:live HYBRID tour where he will headline a stage at the Coachella Music Festival.\n\n\nCONNECT\ndubfire.com\nFacebook/com/dubfire\nTwitter.com/dubfire\nsoundcloud.com/dubfire\nyoutube.com/dubfiretouring\ninstagram.com/dubfire", "otherInfo": "Tronic turns 25 this year and since we are not able to celebrate with all of you on our scheduled label showcases around the world we invite you to our Virtual Anniversary in collaboration with Beatport."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Christian Smith ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8486240.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Tech-house, Electronic, Techno, House", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Swedish citizen, Christian Smith spent the late 80\u2019s years in Germany soaking up the early house and techno sound of Sven Vath.

The group was a major component of the young generation of white blues artists\u2014also including Paul Butterfield, Charlie Musselwhite, Harvey Mandel, Barry Goldberg, Nick Gravenites and Michael Bloomfield\u2014who learned the historic Chicago blues style at the feet and hands of such towering figures as Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy and Sam Lay.\n\nCorky played with all these greats at Siegel-Schwall\u2019s first steady engagement, in 1965 at Peppers, Chicago\u2019s internationally renowned blues club. They were soon signed to Vanguard Records, with blues luminary Samuel Charters producing. Their first album, The Siegel-Schwall Band, was released in 1966, and with it the group made San Francisco a virtual second home: There the likes of Janis Joplin, Santana, Steve Miller and Joni Mitchell opened for them (Siegel-Schwall actually produced Mitchell\u2019s demo tape); the band would record three more classic albums for Vanguard up through 1970, then five for Wooden Nickel/RCA through 1974 before going on hiatus.\n\nIn 1973 the band released Three Pieces for Blues Band and Symphony Orchestra on the prestigious classical music label Deutsche Grammophon.

They also incorporate symphonic elements into their sound. The past years, their melodies have taken much more melancholic turn and the sound is overall much darker.\n\nBiography\nInsomnium began to take shape during the bleak spring of 1997. In a quiet town of Joensuu, located in the easternmost part of Finland, four young men were forming a fierce metal band. From the beginning it was clear that this band would make music that was brutal and yet melodic, full of contrasts and changing atmospheres. They took what they regarded as the best aspects of their favourite bands and moulded these influences into a new kind of entity. The result was the marriage of melodic Scandinavian death metal and traditional Finnish tunes. Lyrics turned out to be sorrowful, dream-like tales of love and death that usually took place amidst the Finnish nature. Influences were taken from the Finnish folklore as well as the world literature.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training Insomnium made their first demo-cd, which received praises from all over the world. The second demo was made the following year and it gained a lot of attention as well. This time, record companies got interested, too. In the beginning of 2001 founding members, guitarist Ville Friman, drummer Markus Hirvonen and bassist/vocalist Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, attached a new guitarist, Ville V\u00e4nni to the band. Now Insomnium was stronger than ever and ready to rise to the next level. A deal with Candlelight was signed the same spring and recording of the first album began in the summer.\n\n- In the Halls of Awaiting - was released in April 2002 and it introduced a band that had evolved in many ways. The legacy of Scandinavian death metal was still the core of the music but new layers had appeared around it. There were more nuances and depth in the songs, and the music was more versatile and challenging than before. Progressive shades had crept into the songs, and in many ways the band had stepped aside from the mainstream of melodic death metal. Debut album received excellent reviews in many magazines around the globe, especially in Germany, Finland and North America. The recording of the second album began in summer 2003. The process was somewhat painful but finally in December the new album was ready. - Since the Day It All Came Down - continues the development that the first album began. Songs are more versatile and surprising, progressive influences are ever clearer. Some tracks may even be described as experimental. But the straightforward side of the music hasn\u00b4t gone anywhere, since catchy guitar-harmonies, crushing riffs and soothing acoustic interludes are all still there. Melodies are still the most essential element in the music of Insomnium, but this time the tunes are even more melancholic and wistful than on the debut album. This is a sad and dreary album, heavier and gloomier than the first one, and undoubtedly more challenging. So when you take this path, keep in mind that it takes a while before your eyes get used to the dark...\n\n..And darker it got. With their third release, - Above The Weeping World -, the music got more agressive, harder, louder and the progressive elements grew once again. The first European tour is over, and Insomnium is once again a step closer to world domination.\n\nOfficial website: http://www.insomnium.net", "otherInfo": "Friends, we have good news for you.\nMark your calendars for May 29! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nOfficial announcement:\n\nINSOMNIUM performs a special WINTER\u2019S GATE live stream show\n\nFinland\u2019s spearhead of melodic death metal, Insomnium will play a special worldwide live stream show on Friday, May 29, showtime 19:00 CET.

Viv\u00ed toda mi infancia, y hasta los 17 a\u00f1os, en la ciudad donde nac\u00ed. All\u00ed hice pre-escolar en el Jard\u00edn Infantil \u201cEl Renacuajo\u201d, primaria en el Liceo V. A. L. (Vida, Amor y Luz) y secundaria en el Colegio San Luis Gonz\u00e1ga, ahora Colegio Champagnat, y luego de graduarme del colegio ingres\u00e9 a la VI Brigada del Ej\u00e9rcito, para cumplir con mi a\u00f1o de servicio militar obligatorio. La m\u00fasica siempre ha orbitado a mi alrededor, incluso desde que estaba en la barriga de mi mam\u00e1, Fabiola, ya que ella es m\u00fasico por convicci\u00f3n, aunque la vida la haya llevado a enfrentar otros retos. Incluso tengo memoria del primer bolero que me aprend\u00ed (Deseo), cuando a\u00fan no hab\u00eda nacido, y que mi mam\u00e1 lo cantaba en mi 8\u00ba mes de gestaci\u00f3n. Soy profesional en Finanzas y Relaciones Internacionales, de la Universidad Externado de Colombia en Bogot\u00e1, con diploma y todo, aunque \u00e9ste repose y acumule capas de polvo en alg\u00fan caj\u00f3n, pero siempre supe que mi destino estaba guiado por canciones. He hecho toda la escuela que un m\u00fasico de la calle puede hacer. He cantado en serenatas, con media de aguardiente Tapa Roja como \u00fanico pago, he cantado en bares de diferentes tama\u00f1os y diversos estilos, he amenizado almuerzos, fiestas de 15 a\u00f1os, bautizos, cap\u00edtulos de novelas, y hasta alg\u00fan velorio, y tuve bar propio cantado canciones ajenas. Fue all\u00ed donde tuve la oportunidad de conocer y perfeccionar el oficio de cantar en vivo, noche tras noche, haciendo de la comunicaci\u00f3n entre el artista y la gente nuestra virtud m\u00e1s relevante. Alguien me dijo alguna vez que la m\u00fasica me hab\u00eda salvado la vida, y estoy de acuerdo. Es lo que mejor se hacer, ya que mi zurda nunca fue prodigiosa con el bal\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 otra cosa quedaba por hacer? Cuando uno es un peque\u00f1\u00edn siempre dice: \u201cQuiero ser futbolista, o m\u00fasico, o Superman\u201d, por suerte le pegu\u00e9 a una de las tres. Las canciones me vienen del alma, y no conozco otra manera de escribir, y quisiera pensar que cuando alguien oye alguna de mis canciones, en un disco, en la radio, o en un concierto, es all\u00ed, al alma, el lugar al cual llegar\u00e1. Y escribo de amor, en todas sus formas, incluido el desamor, su forma m\u00e1s cruel. Mi equipaje para llegar a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d lo componen 2 discos, anteriores, muchos amores y varias traiciones, una visita al infierno, y un auto-descubrimiento de lo que soy. En 2003 sali\u00f3 al mercado \u201cSolo hasta hoy\u201d, con \u201cNo mires atr\u00e1s\u201d y \u201cUna y otra vez\u201d como banderas, y en el 2006 sali\u00f3 \u201cSentidos\u201d, donde fueron \u201cAcabado\u201d y \u201cTus Regalos\u201d las canciones m\u00e1s importantes, comercialmente hablando. \u00c9stos dos cap\u00edtulos musicales me han brindado varios de los momentos m\u00e1s emocionantes de mi vida, siendo el m\u00e1s importante la respuesta de la gente frente a mis canciones, pero tambi\u00e9n me permiti\u00f3 conocer a varios de mis \u00eddolos, y compartir escenario y canciones con ellos, artistas como Alejandro Sanz, Pablo Milan\u00e9s, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Fito P\u00e1ez y Franco de Vita, han salpicado e inspirado con su arte lo que hago, y he tenido la fortuna de abrir sus shows, y en algunos casos cantar hombro a hombro en el escenario. Ahora estamos frente a \u00e9ste \u201cCruce de Caminos\u201d, desde que escrib\u00ed la primera de las 30 canciones que compuse para \u00e9ste \u00e1lbum hasta ahora han pasado 23 meses, muchos \u00e1ngeles, y 2 viajes a Espa\u00f1a, y ha sido un camino maravilloso. Espero que las canciones que seleccionamos les gusten, en palabras de Nacho Ma\u00f1\u00f3, el productor musical de \u00e9ste disco, y mi hermano del alma, \u201ces un disco sincero, personal y sincero, algo cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de encontrar en \u00e9ste negocio\u201d. \u201cCREO EN SECRETOS, Y EN EL ARTE COMO FORMA DE VIDA, CREO EN QUE TODO SE DEVUELVE, EN EL MISTERIO Y LA AVENTURA.

We hope Canada will share her with us.\u201d (Hot Indie Music Review) Krystle Dos Santos has taken her experience from the Canadian College of Performing Arts, and transformed it into the beginnings of a career already full of achievements. Unveiling her talents to the public with her 2008 full length self-titled debut, Dos Santos was instantly recognized as a force by the Western Canadian Music Awards, winning the Urban Recording of the Year. That same album charted for six weeks on CJSR FM88\u2019s Urban chart and was top ten on 92.5 The X in Kamloops, BC. One of the single\u2019s from the album even appeared in an Episode of ABC\u2019s Samantha Who? But to simply classify Dos Santos as a recording artist would be neglecting one of the most intriguing aspects of her talents. Whether facing the crowd on her own or with her full ensemble of band-mates as she is more accustomed, Dos Santos uses a sultry tone and eccentric array of melodies to create an intimately magnetic connection with her audience. She is able to further engage her audience by shifting seamlessly through genres, embodying her musical influences-Nina Simone, Etta James, Alicia Keys-culminating into a powerful live experience that fuses jazz, soul, pop, funk and blues into an arena of styles and sounds that takes listeners from mid-20th century Harlem, right up to present day L.A. With key performances at the Edmonton International Jazz Festival, Whistler International Film Festival, and the Honey Jam Showcase in Toronto, Krystle has had many opportunities to put her live shows on full display. She has already toured extensively throughout western Canada, singing stories of pain and love, joy and redemption, all told through a voice that precisely reflects the emotion of her music. It is nearly impossible to be a true fan of Krystle Dos Santos without taking part in the experience she creates with her live performances. Dos Santos completed her second album in the first quarter of 2011. Femme Fatale, as it was aptly titled, again revealed Dos Santos versatility and her ability to capture the audience with an eclectic mix of dance and funk, but always with the soulful jazz vocals for which she has quickly become renowned. Dos Santos\u2019 interpretation of her influences has made it difficult to categorize her style. Compared presently to Jill Scott or Corrine-Bailey Rae or even Erykah Badu, Krystle is able to personalize her sound and message, adding her own character to her music to create a uniquely refreshing sound. Her vibrant personality has been utilized outside of music in various add campaigns and modeling opportunities. It also helps that Krystle is as stunning as she is talented; one of those rare beauties that command attention with little more than a moments glance. But make no mistake, Krystle Dos Santos is a musician first and foremost. With a smoky voice that can fluctuate to fit any style and a live show that demands the audience stand-up and take notice, Dos Santos is ready for the masses to feel her music. She is currently working on her third studio release, and will no doubt continue to strive until her name and her music is known to the world.

This fresh-faced native of Southampton, England, was merely playing into his love of funkadelic hip-hop and crooning urban stylings when he started writing songs as a teenager. His love for Terence Trent D'Arby, Sisqo, and Donnell Jones allowed him to put his creative love for art, culture, and history into a musical beat all his own. And the new millennium belonged to him and garage had been redefined.\n\nBorn Craig Ashley David on May 5, 1981, David was slicing and dicing ragga and R&B on the local station PCRS 106.5FM and found himself playing club gigs prior to rubbing elbows with some of music's finest. It was during this time he hooked with Artful Dodger's Mark Hill. After winning a national writing competition, Craig was more than ready to start producing with Hill. His big break came when he put his own additives on Damage's \"I'm Ready,\" a B-side to \"Wonderful Tonight.\" Soon thereafter he remixed his own version of Human League's \"Human\" and started himself a regular spot in area clubs during the weekends. \"Rewind\" was another underground smash, specifically a definitive move for David. His respect for Stevie Wonder, Faith Evans, and R. Kelly was most apparent, however his own vocal talent was beginning to shine. He and Hill's specialty show on Capital Radio provided another outlet for David to shape his musical work of genius. \"Fill Me In\" proved yet another hit, shooting straight to number one in summer 2000. David was now the youngest British male solo artist to have a number one single. He was 19-years-old.\n\nA deal with Wildstar Records in the U.K. sparked toward the end of the summer as \"Re-Rewind\" and \"7 Days\" gained praise in late November. A stateside agreement with Atlantic also led to more global hype. He had sold 3.5 million records worldwide and garage was finally becoming massive overseas and it was David's debut Born to Do It that was at the head.\n\nBut not all were pulling for this R&B prodigy. Aside from winning three awards at the MOBO's in October, Craig David walked away empty handed at the 2000 Brit Awards in February 2001. He was up for six nominations, including Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Newcomer, and Best British Single for \"7 Days,\" but industry politics fell into operation. Many mainstream stars came to David's defense, artists such as Elton John, U2, and Robbie Williams, professing their disgust for the ill recognition for David and his musical efforts in the past year. Death threats soon followed for the superstar in spring 2001 as he took the stage in a show in London. An anonymous caller claimed a soldier would injure David with tear gas and hand grenades. Still, his record sales continued to soar in the U.K. with sales of Born to Do It increasing over 100 percent after his dismal beginning months of 2001. He bombared American Shores with a deal with Atlantic and released Born to Do It stateside in summer 2001. Mainstream radio flocked to him immediately. Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, and Usher called themselves fans.\n\nThe next year, things didn't simmer down for the now international pop star. Craig David returned with a sophomore effort Slicker Than Your Average in November 2002. This particular album saw a much grittier side from David. Debut single \"What's Your Flava?\" also became one of the year's hottest singles.\n\nIn 2005 he released his 3rd album \"The Story Goes...\", the first single of the album, \"All The Way\", returned him to the top three, and the second single, \"Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\", tied with \"7 Days\" as his longest running single in the charts since \"Rewind\", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. However, the album's third single, \"Unbelievable\", debuted and peaked at #18 in March 2006.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated with UK rapper Kano on his upcoming album London Town, for the single \"This is the Girl\". The track was released on August 27, 2007 and debuted at #18 on the UK charts.\n\nThe first single \"Hot Stuff\" from the album Trust Me, was released on November 5, 2007 . The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"6 of 1 Thing\", the second single to be taken from Trust Me charted at thirty-nine on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his second lowest charting single to date.\n\nHis UK tour will start in June 2008, details of which can be found on the official website.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Luiza Zan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10397948.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Jazz, Big Band, Funk, Bossa Nova, Jazz-funk", "Time": "5:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Tulcea (October 7th 1980), Luiza Zan is one of the prominent figures in Romanian jazz.

As numerous members came and went, the band followed a varied musical evolution through rock, hardcore, pop covers, progressive, and neo-classical instrumental work. A renewed focus was discovered with the introduction of Ciaran Cahill, and the band began to gig with the likes of Eden Maine, My Awesome Compilation, Jairus, and Tribute to Nothing.\n\nIn 2005 Piano signed to Japanese label Zestone records through whom the debut EP \u2018Monogamy is Encouraged\u2019 was released; selling many thousands over the first few months.

Heavily influenced by soul greats such as Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin, Knight has released four studio albums and one compilation collection to date. Widely labelled as one of Britain's greatest soul singers, Knight is best known for her hit singles \"Greatest Day\", \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" and \"Come As You Are\" and \"Get Up!\". After a decade in the industry, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Urban Music Awards in 2004.\n\nIn 2006 Knight starred in BBC1 music TV show, Just The Two Of Us, and is the host of the Radio 2 show Beverley's Gospel Nights, which explores the origins and impact of gospel music. Now in its second season, the show has featured interviews with stars such as Destiny's Child and Shirley Caesar.\n\nKnight is an ambassador for many charities such Christian Aid and has travelled to areas affected by disease and poverty to help raise awareness. She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music. She became an MBE in 2006, the only musician to be granted such an honour in the Queen's eightieth birthday honours list.\n\nIn February 2006 Knight consolidated her move into the mainstream audience by appearing on BBC1 music show, Just The Two of Us. The show, featuring celebrities who duet with established singers, ran for two weeks and proved to be a relative disappointment in terms of audience figures \u2013 averaging between fifteen and twenty-five percent audience shares.[17] Nevertheless it provided a platform for Knight to reach out to a bigger audience and demonstrate her talent by performing a different array of songs than she would otherwise be known for. Reaching out to new audiences was also a driving force behind Knight\u2019s decision to join Take That on their reunion arena tour. Take That - The Ultimate Tour 06, which ran from April to July 2006, sold 270,000 tickets in less than four hours on sale at the box office and featured Knight as a support act.[18]\n\nIn March 2006 Beverley released her fifth album, a compilation set featuring the majority of her top forty UK singles entitled Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight. The album, which was certified Gold less than a month after its release,[19] became her second highest charting of her career when it entered the UK albums chart at number ten and rose to number nine a month later. It was preceded by the single \"Piece of my Heart\" \u2013 a cover of the Erma Franklin classic made famous by Janis Joplin and entered the singles chart at number sixteen, spending eleven weeks inside the UK top 75 singles chart and becoming her longest-running chart single to date.\n\nIn October 2006, Knight recorded her fifth studio album, Music City Soul, in Nashville. Completed in less than five days, the album was released on 7 May 2007 and features collaborations with musicians such as Ronnie Wood and Scotty Moore. It has spawned three singles thus far, \"No Man's Land\", released on 16 April 2007, \"After You\", released on 2 July 2007 and \"The Queen of Starting Over\", released on 15 October 2007.\n\nBeverley will be releasing her next album in spring 2009", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LP Giobbi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10388009.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electro House, Dance Pop, Disco, House, Electro Pop", "Time": "5:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LP Giobbi is rock \u2019n roll with a disco soul, born draped in sequins and cloaked in fog at a seance in the mountains of Oregon.\n\nShe was trained in jazz piano at UC Berkeley before becoming a synth warrior goddess in Los Angeles.

Derek Warfield is a distinguished name among them. Derek Warfield and They Young Wolfe Tones are bringing that musical tradition forward with a reverence for Ireland\u2019s past and the energy and optimism of a new generation of Irish musicians. \u201cWe\u2019re presenting an old tradition in a new package \u2013 and I\u2019ve the same passion for it now as I had when it all started 50 years ago!\u201d DEREK WARFIELD After spending nearly 40 years as founder/leader of the legendary Wolfe Tones (named after the 18th century Irish Revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone), Derek Warfield is revered as a singer, songwriter, historian and entertainer in all parts of the world where Irish roots have been put down. The Wolfe Tones enjoyed phenomenal success with 13 best-selling albums, 3 number one hits, many television appearances and shows in esteemed venues such as New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in London. Since breaking away from the Wolfe Tones in 2001, Derek\u2019s solo career has yielded 11 albums to date, the most successful of them being On the One Road, The Bonnie Blue Flag and Let Ye All be Irish Tonight. With the formation and ongoing success of The Young Wolfe Tones, the legend of Derek Warfield continues. LEGACY \u2013 THE YOUNG WOLFE TONES In 2001, after nearly 40 years performing, the legendary Wolfe Tones parted with their founder and leader \u2013 Derek Warfield. No other Irish folk group, before or since, told the story of Ireland so completely and unapologetically. But for Derek\u2019s hunger and desire to continue to further the story of Ireland through song, an ancient tradition might have lost perhaps its most iconic figure. In 2006 Derek put together a band containing some of the finest musicians and singers in Irish music \u2013 The Young Wolfe Tones. Damaris Woods - Banjo Damaris Woods from Co. Meath and is recognized as one of the foremost banjo players in Irish music. She has made a major contribution in popularizing the banjo within Irish traditional music. Damaris has performed an extremely hectic touring schedule over the last decade across the world. She has appeared on the Irish Spring Tour in Germany and been part of performing groups in North America, Australia and the prestigious Celtic Colours Festival in Cape Briton, Canada. Damaris has appearances on many radio and television shows including Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show (RT\u00c9). Damaris is also a gifted music and many of her students have been prominent prizewinners in traditional music competitions over the last number of years. On an annual basis Damaris organizes the hugely popular traditional arts camp \u2013 The Ag Seinm Traditional Arts Camp in Co. Cavan, Ireland. Despite her own hectic schedule she still manages to find time to teach at the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drunshambo every year as well as The University of Ulster, Coleraine. Peadar Hickey \u2013 Guitar and Vocals Dublin\u2019s Peadar Hickey has been delivering the songs of Ireland\u2019s history to audiences at home and abroad for over a decade. A regular fixture on the Dublin city folk and traditional music circuit, Peadar learned his trade on stage at The Arlington Hotels, Oliver St John Gogarty\u2019s and The Temple Bar in Dublin\u2019s Cultural Quarter. In 2010, Peadar moved to New York City and now performs mainly on the Irish American circuit, teaming up with notable musicians such as Pio Ryan (banjo), Matt Mancuso (fiddle) and Vonnie Quinn (fiddle). On St Patrick\u2019s Day 2013, Peadar was invited to join All-Ireland winning accordion player Martin O\u2019Connell in a performance at the New York Mayor\u2019s residence \u2013 Gracie Mansion. Peadar is currently an instructor of guitar for traditional Irish accompaniment at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. Dan Lowery \u2013 Flute and Vocals Dan Lowery is one of the top Irish flute players in the United States today. Born in Milwaukee, raised in Dallas, and with ancestry from County Cork, Dan spent his youth travelling to Ireland learning traditional Irish music. A tour with Surreel, a band of up-and-coming American Irish musicians, prompted him to move to New York in 2002, where he has lived for the past ten years playing Irish music full-time. In demand as a flute and whistle player, and also as a guitarist, singer and teacher, he has appeared on stage and recordings with numerous musicians and bands, including Ivan Goff, Damien Connolly, Allison Barber, Johnny Cuomo, Ashley Davis, Darren Maloney, the Trinity Hall Session Players and Idle Road. Dan has been a member of Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2010. Derek Warfield\u2019s 50 years of experience coupled with the talent and energy of The Young Wolfe Tones brings the old tradition of Irish balladry into a new age. The story of Ireland is transmitted in their music and song and illuminated by the outstanding musicianship of three wonderful ambassadors of a new generation of traditional players. Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones deliver Ireland\u2019s traditional music and folk songs with an energy and skill that shows the quality of contemporaries within that tradition. The patriotic spirit of Irish music carried through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by the Wolfe Tones now marches on in the dynamic sound of The Young Wolfe Tones. SHOWS Irish festivals all over the United States have been host to Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones since 2007. Currently the band plays between 20 and 30 Irish festivals per year all over the country. In addition to musical performances, Derek also delivers lectures on Irish history and the history of the Irish in America. These lectures feature acoustic performances of ballads relevant to the subject matter. Perhaps most notably, the band performed at the great Milwaukee Irish Festival in 2011 - the biggest Irish festival in the world. Pat Byrne from Columbus Ohio, one of the organizing committee at the Dublin Irish Festival in Ohio, had this to say \u201cDerek has always set high standards for his performances and this band raises the bar. The people loved them and gave them an unbelievable rousing and appreciative reception. These Young Wolfe Tones and their legendary leader were given a standing ovation, The Dublin Ohio festival were delighted to have them \u2026 they\u2019re as good as it gets!\u201d Australia was the destination in April of 2011. The band played twelve concerts in two weeks with the highlight being four days performing at the National Folk Festival in Canberra. The same year saw the release of Far Away in Australia \u2013 a CD to coincide with their Australian visit. With 19 tracks the collection is a mixture of classic Irish songs music and literature that connect the two countries. Far Away In Australia fittingly highlights the Irish contributions to Australia in song and music. They perform regularly at the R\u00ed R\u00e1 Irish Pub at Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas and are certainly regarded as a unique stalwart among Las Vegas\u2019 many musical acts. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY AND CIVIL WARS Many of the Irish festivals around the United States every year also play host to lectures/musical performances on the songs of the Irish in the American Revolution and Civil War by Derek Warfield and The Young Wolfe Tones. Derek deals with ballads of regret, joy, victory and defeat and clearly illustrates Ireland's hand in defending the ideals that the United States was founded on. The lecture/show has been an eye-opener for many folk and history enthusiasts from Ireland and America alike. The response and feedback throughout the festival circuit here has been wonderful and has added such a wide and important aspect to the legacy of Derek Warfield and his part in the history of Irish balladry. It is a rich legacy that was almost entirely neglected before Derek began putting together Sons of Erin, Bonnie Blue Flag, Faugh-a-Ballagh and Washington's Irish \u2014 four albums dealing with the Irish of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. He has also written a book, The Irish Songster of the American Civil War. He comments: \u201cLooking at the tremendous quality of the songwriting among the Irish over generations in the States, as recorded in libraries and collections across the country, it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that Ireland lost its greatest talent in those times, particularly in those who starved or emigrated during the Famine years.\u201d \u201cI hope it helps to keep alive the memory of the many Irishmen who fought on both sides,\u201d he says. Derek Warfield\u2019s lifelong passion for engaging people in the music and story of Ireland is also very present in the other band members: \u201cCommunication with a live audience through music is what I believed to be of primary importance when I founded the Wolfe Tones in 1963. In performing with The Young Wolfe Tones, I continue to communicate with audiences while also passing on an important tradition to a new generation. But perhaps most importantly, it has been fun and enjoyable and every performance gets better. The experience has reinvigorated me and given the young players and singers the opportunity to display their skills and talents around the world\u201d www.theyoungwolfetones.com www.facebook.com/theyoungwolfetones www.irishworldradio.com DISCOGRAPHY Legacy Faugh-a-Ballagh (Clear The Way) Bonnie Blue Flag Sons Of Erin Liberte 98 Sl\u00e1n Abhaile A Nation Once Again God Save Ireland Green White & Essential Gold Volume 2 (2 CD Set) Green White & Essential Gold Volume 1 (2 CD Set) The Night Is....Young On The One Road Far Away In Australia On The One Road Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight (Available from www.theyoungwolfetones.com) Fifty years on from his debut performance, Warfield is now delighted to present the Young Wolfe Tones.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Guordan Banks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10371486.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Hip-hop R&b Pop And Soul", "Time": "6:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter GUORDAN (Pronounced Jour-dan) BANKS has had major success writing songs for artists such as John Legend, Keyshia Cole, K.

With both of his parents being preachers and his siblings all being vocalists, it's no surprise that he began singing at only five years old.\n\n\"Music has been instilled in me all of my life,\" he confesses. \"So essentially, I'm just embracing who I am. At first, his young position in a large family relegated him to supporting roles, usually that of a background tenor. However, he was met with adversity due to a speech impediment. \"I used to have a bad stuttering problem and because of that a lot of people would stay away from me in school,\" he admits. In fourth grade he tried out for a part in his school's rendition of Oliver Twist, but the director dismissed him, informing him that he wasn't fit for the production: if he couldn't speak clearly, how could he ever expect to sing?\n\nGuordan's mother, however, observed that her son's speech issues weren't present in his singing and came up with a plan: she would truly make him sing for his supper. Instead of speaking to her, all of his communication would have to be in melodic form. \"I would literally sing to my mother if I wanted to go to the store, or outside,\" Banks recalls.\n\n\"Whatever I had to say to her, I would sing to her. Through that, I began to build my confidence and learned to talk without a stutter. It also helped me become the songwriter I am today, because I don't ever really write anything down with a pen or a pad. I just sing it out and whatever comes out is what I use and adjust to keep.

Moved to Austin to attend UT (hook 'em horns). Lived a pretty normal life, bought a house, worked a job, and got married. Then decided to become a singer...and by default, a songwriter. Now with 4 solo albums, a solo EP, two duo covers albums, plenty of guest vocals on other great albums, and a slew of songwriting awards under her belt, BettySoo's life looks pretty different from how it did nine years ago, when she was a newlywed in graduate school (she dropped out to be a musician). BettySoo's shows are ever-changing and entertaining - as much for what is said off the cuff between songs as for the songwriting and her breathtaking delivery. Backed by her band in Austin, Texas (including Will Sexton, Jeff Plankenhorn, Brian Standefer, Todd Wilson, Paul Prestridge, and husband Mail Man Dave Terry), she's garnered her share of great show reviews on top of the critical success her albums have achieved. Her newest album was recorded with her friend and cellist Brian Standefer at his studio in Buda, TX. Featuring 12 original songs that cover heavy material - in a range of styles, from fresh pop to raw grit to lush string and woodwind arrangements, When We're Gone has received high praise across the U.S. A side project, an acoustic duo with Canadian dobro master Doug Cox, has seen plenty of miles in its first year: BettySoo and Doug have played in the States, Canada, England, Scotland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. BettySoo's songwriting awards include: Kerrville New Folk Award, Mountain Stage NewSong Winner, Wildflower! Festival Songwriting Competition Winner, Sisters Folk Festival Songwriting Competition Winner, and Big Top Chautauqua Songwriter of the Year. She has been a featured performer at SXSW, International Folk Alliance, Tin Pan South, Kerrville Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, Vancouver Island Folk Festival, Old Settlers Music Festival, Wilderness Songs Festival (Netherlands), and many revered listening rooms. Her style? There\u2019s a little gospel, some straight-ahead folk, a bit of twang, a bit of pop, and maybe even a familiar oldie with a new twist. If you're planning to see her live, be ready for a surprise. Then again, not much about BettySoo isn\u2019t surprising. People are surprised just to see her take the stage. Plain-faced, petite (clocking in at exactly 5 feet), and freckly, people don\u2019t have any idea what to expect \u2013 they certainly don\u2019t expect such a large voice and moving songs. \u201cI guess Asian-American singer-songwriters aren\u2019t that common,\u201d she comments, \u201cat least, not in Texas.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s the whole issue of her name. How did a second-generation Korean end up with such a classic southern name? Is it a stage name? \u201cNo,\u201d she answers, laughing, \u201cI guess I\u2019m just lucky that way. It\u2019s right there on my birth certificate. Soo is my dad\u2019s middle name, too. Yep, he\u2019s a boy named Soo.\u201d Grew up in Spring, TX. Lives in Austin. Travels all the time to sing songs.

During this time, he has also managed to release 4 artist albums and some of the most iconic house music tracks of the last two decades.\n\nMost people know Claude VonStroke for his smiling DJ persona touring every major city, festival, and basement after-party around the world. But Claude has also influenced the very fabric of the dance community, A&Ring an impeccable roster of acts like Justin Martin, Fisher, Shiba San, Catz n Dogz, Riva Starr, Tim Green, Breach, Eats Everything, Walker & Royce, Shadow Child, and countless others. (And even naming a few of these artists.) Today, his Dirtybird label continues to surprise and innovate in the underground dance scene, releasing an enigmatic combination of house, funk, dirty bass, and electronica.\n\nVonStroke has released four original artist albums, a remix album, and a live album recorded when he closed the famed Movement Festival in his original hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Some other music highlights include working on records with Bootsy Collins, Rihanna, Disclosure and Kevin Saunderson, as well as a few #1 and #2 hits on Beatport. His partnership with Green Velvet as \u201cGET REAL\u201d has been one of the most rewarding friendships as Claude originally modeled his career off the quirky enigmatic style of his mentor and now good friend from Chicago.\n\nIn 2015, VonStroke brought his first festival to light called Dirtybird Campout, a unique boutique festival based on the games and activities associated with American Summer camp mixed with the best underground house and bass music in the world. He continues to innovate and curate new events with a 2 additional multi-day festival mirroring his Birdhouse radio show in Chicago, and his record BBQ event series that has been going since 2003!\n\nVonStroke also loves art; most notably pop-surrealist artwork that he has commissioned for the last 7 years on Dirtybird for all of the releases. Each year he hires a new artist and has had the pleasure of working with renowned artists such as Jeremy Fish, Dulk, Graham Carter, Dan May, Charlie Immer, Raoul Deleo and Felicia Chiao. Walking through the Dirtybird HQ in Los Angeles is like walking through an art gallery in the Wynwood district of Miami.\n\nA lot of his success can be attributed to a good attitude. Claude does not scowl or look mean while he DJs. He does not pretend to know everything and he truly loves his fans. He is grateful to be curating, creating and performing music for a living and he knows that the reason people go to parties is to shake their booty and have fun.", "otherInfo": "Tune in this Friday for a coffee break with Claude VonStroke and Marc Houle.

Being 1 of very few DJs in England back then to get their 1st ever gig on the legendary Funktion One Sound Speaker System! And been 1 of the very 1st trance DJs to play at that venue!!\n\nSince then Ed has travelled to many places showcasing his DJing abilities, such as regular appearances at The Gallery @ Ministry Of Sound (Including playing The Main Room, 103 and The Baby Box), Trance Sanctuary @ The Egg, The Rhythm Factory, Frantic @ Koko, Trancelucid @ Club 414, Digital Impact @ Plan B, and Friendz and Submerged Boat Parties in London.

And will reach 100 episodes in August 2016.\n\nThe style of music Ed plays is a very energetic blend of Tech Trance and Hard Trance with a bit of Hard Techno thrown in for good measure! He also likes to incorporate plenty of Mashups and bootlegs into his sets. And the occasional scratch or 2! But on the odd occasion likes to play the \"softer\" side of trance if asked nicely!!\n\nProduction wise. Ed had his 1st original single out in the summer of 2014, appropiately titled \"Adrenalin\u201d, and a year later in 2015 with \u201cEpinephrine\u201d. Ed has also been making a name for himself producing mashups under the alias \u201cDirty chef\u201d. His 1st mashup of \u201cDK8 vs Underworld \u2013 Murder Was the Slippy Bass\u201d stormed the crowds he played to in the summer 2008 as well as causing chaos on the dance floor with \"Enjoy The Silence For The Weekend\" in 2012, \"Advanced Bastard\" in 2013,\u201cGenetic Ping Pong Animals\u201d and \u201cHybrid Spaceman\u201d in 2014 and \u201cZero Voodoo\u201d in 2015. Also in 2015 at Club414 he performed as Dirty Chef showcasing his mashups and mashing more tunes on the fly! A project that might return!\n\nIn 2013 Ed Lynam joined the Elevation Audio Label/Promo along with his good friend Lewis Duggleby as Audio, Web & Technology Manager as well as been resident closing DJ for the brand. Their hard work has lead to a string of releases in the Top 100 beatport Trance chart, as well as a monthly residency at Ministry of Sound, and other solo run events in London, Ibiza and Holland. 3 Years later the brand is strong as ever\n\nWith now a decade of experience, Ed continues to wow the crowds with energetic interaction, wearing his Oakley Sunglasses (No matter how dark it is!) and general all out enthusiasm behind the decks!

During a bad patch in his life, when he\u2019d lost his woman, was stuck in a dead end job, and down on his luck, he decided to make a change. Leaving everything behind, he took to the road on a musical pilgrimage around America that would come to define his sound and himself. Picking up an old guitar in a pawn shop along the way he found gigs from town to town playing his way across the states in the tradition of the delta Bluesmen before him.\n\nThen while stumbling home drunk one night along the main drag of Nashville, he came across a crowd. The crowd were surrounding an old man playing a one string guitar made from a broom handle and a box, while playing drums with his feet. In that moment Ben new he had found the inspiration he was looking for. But it wasn\u2019t until he made his way to New Orleans that he managed to get his hands on such an instrument. Walking down the backstreets of the french quarter he found his way into an old instrument shop selling a cigar box guitar. And he realised that he\u2019d discovered something special.\n\nWhen he finally got back to London along with the collection of songs he\u2019d written along the road, he recorded his first album \u2018Broken Man\u2019. With nothing more than the equipment he had to hand, he self released the album to critical acclaim.

The Los Angeles based troubadour uncovers an era-spanning style of his own at the crossroads of traditional folk songcraft, impressive guitarwork, bluesy gusto, and 21st century pop adventurousness. The singer and songwriter sifts through a lifetime of influences in order to assemble a vibrant, vivid, and vital vision.\n\nThis poignant, passionate, and personal style resounds throughout his 2018 EP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of popular music that I respect and the classics I grew up on, because they will always be a part of who I am,\u201d he explains. \u201cI started out by making a lot of Americana folk rock, but I really wanted to explore new sounds. For the first time, the new music reflects everything\u2014from what inspired me to be a musician and a guitar player in the first place such as Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jackson Browne to artists I\u2019ve just discovered in recent years like Ed Sheeran. There are those songwriter elements as well as the modern nuances. I feel as if I\u2019m moving with a new generation.\u201d\n\nSince his emergence in 2015, he has quietly set the stage for such an evolution. At 19-years-old, Corey dropped out of college in Eugene, Oregon, grabbed his guitar, and relocated to an eternal haven for creatives of all kinds: Venice Beach, CA.\n\nJust blocks away from the Pacific Ocean, he spearhead the genesis of an arts collective and hangout known as Winston House. After reposting clips of Corey on guitar, Cody Simpson tapped him to handle six-string duties on a national tour. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber caught a Winston House performance and invited Corey to open up a run of Pacific Northwest dates on the sold-out Purpose Tour in 2016.\n\nTeaming up with producer Andrew Wells [Meghan Trainor, Jason MrAZ, Bebe Rexha, etc.], he unveiled the On The Run EP following his appearance on the historic tour. Its title track racked up 7 million-plus streams as he garnered widespread acclaim from Rolling Stone, Billboard, American Songwriter, Teen Vogue, Baeble Music, and more. Along the way, he toured with the likes of Niall Horan, Noah Kahan, and more.\n\nIn early 2018, he relocated to a studio in Topanga, CA. Exploring new sonic territory, he started amassing an arsenal of guitar pedals to \u201ccome up with new riffs and sounds\u201d and channel \u201cwhat the past year looked and sounded like into a six-song EP.\u201d\n\nNow, Corey introduces that EP by way of the single \u201cWild Nights.\u201d It juxtaposes a cinematic piano-driven soundscape with bluesy guitar and handclaps before culminating on a slick, soulful, and soaring confession, \u201cI\u2019ll give up all the wild times, jump into the wild fires, just to have one more wild night with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about knowing that you\u2019re so in love with someone and satisfied that you\u2019d never want anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you were ever separated from this person, you\u2019d give up everything just for one more memorable night together. You\u2019d sacrifice everything.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the EP, \u201cDried Blood\u201d stretches from stark and stripped verses into a powerhouse chant. Meanwhile, \u201cCloser\u201d pairs a steady and strong beat with plaintive acoustic guitar and another hard-hitting hook, \u201cI just want you closer, closer than my demons.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Corey emerges with a striking signature sound that immediately connects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to inspire others to have a voice of their own and be themselves,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMusic did that for me. I feel like I have the opportunity to hopefully do the same thing for listeners.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live stream at https://live.bandsintown.com"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Calibre 50 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8654782.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Don Gallardo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9934409.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Roots Music, Americana, Folk Rock, Folk Acoustic Rock, American Folk, American Roots Music, Country, Alt-country, Country And Soul.", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "ROLLING STONE'S \"10 Artists You Need To Know\" - September 2017\nwww.rollingstone.com/country/lists/10-new-country-artists-you-need-to-know-september-2017-w500707/don-gallardo-w500720\n\n\nDon Gallardo has called Nashville home for over 11 years.

With their new album, Family Dinner, Volume 2, the eclectic, unclassifiable jazz/funk/global collective has set their sights higher than ever.\n\n\u201cWe had a wish list of artists we wanted to collaborate with from a wide array of styles,\u201d says bassist/composer/producer Michael League. \u201cWe tried to come up with different demographics, nationalities, even age groups. Beyond that, we wanted to write arrangements that not only the band would really shine on, but would also truly capture the essence of each artist.\u201d\n\nThe result is a free-wheeling, wide-ranging collection, recorded live in New Orleans, featuring an astonishing list of musicians from around the world, including Susana Baca, Charlie Hunter, Salif Keita, Laura Mvula, David Crosby, and an all-star group of Big Easy players including Ivan Neville and Terence Blanchard. Various combinations of the three-dozen members of Snarky Puppy act as the house band for an unprecedented journey through different sounds, genres, and cultures.\n\nThe album is the second installment of a series that started with 2014\u2019s Grammy-winning Family Dinner - Volume One, and is the follow-up to Snarky Puppy\u2019s most recent release, Sylva, a collaboration with Holland\u2019s Metropole Orkest that garnered a 2016 Grammy nomination and entered at #1 on both Billboard\u2019s Jazz and Heatseekers Charts. The record (which comes packaged with a companion DVD that features footage of the recording process and artist interviews) is the first release in a joint partnership between Universal Music Classics and GroundUP Records, the label owned and operated by League; a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the New Orleans music education and mentorship organization Roots of Music.\n\nFormed in 2004 at the acclaimed music school of the University of North Texas, Snarky Puppy exists as both an original music ensemble and a production team/session band, with individual sideman credits as diverse as Kirk Franklin, Snoop Dogg, Marcus Miller, and St. Vincent. Voted \u201cBest Jazz Group\u201d in Downbeat\u2019s 2015 Reader\u2019s Poll, as well as \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and \u201cBest Electric/Jazz-Rock/Contemporary Group/Artist\u201d in Jazz Times\u2019 2014 Reader\u2019s Poll, they have earned accolades everywhere from the BBC to the Los Angeles Times, and All Music recently called the group \u201cone of modern music's bright lights.\u201d\n\nThe Family Dinner concept grew out of the band\u2019s weekly late-night sessions at New York\u2019s Rockwood Music Hall, where they invited different guests for each show. Settling on eight of their favorite collaborators, they gathered in Roanoke, Virginia for the making of Volume One, which was honored with a Grammy in the Best R&B Performance category.\n\n\u201cI love that album, but it was kind of heavy on female R&B,\u201d says League. \u201cThe main difference this time was that we invited guest instrumentalists and paired them with singers. We put the Swedish trio V\u00e4sen with Becca Stevens, an Appalachian singer-songwriter, and as soon as they sat down, it felt like they were had been playing together for years\u2014and that happened with each combination of artists.\u201d\n\nSetting up shop in New Orleans\u2019 Esplanade Studios, Snarky Puppy rehearsed for three days on their own, then for another two days with the guest artists, and brought in an audience for three days of recording. The studio building became one big, all-day hang-out: the tone was set when guitarist Charlie Hunter went into a storage room to try out some amps, only to find everyone piling into the closet with him, yelling encouragement.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for something like this is the attitude, and all the musicians were amazing,\u201d says League. \u201cPeople would be downstairs jamming and talking and sticking around to be with each other. It was all egoless, just a joy.\u201d\n\nThough participants came from South America, Africa, and Europe, perhaps the most surprising Dinner guest was Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer David Crosby. \u201cSomeone turned him on to the group and he was tweeting about us every day,\u201d says League. \u201cMy family are huge CSNY fans, so I sent him a PM on Twitter and he replied within an hour. He said he was in the middle of a writing binge, so I said we should do one of the new songs. The first one he sent me was \u2018Somebody Home,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 It\u2019s the only ballad on the album, and it\u2019s stark. Beautiful.\u201d\n\nOf course, the incomparable setting also had an impact on the music of Family Dinner, Volume 2\u2014especially since the sessions came during the days leading up to Mardi Gras. \u201cNew Orleans is its own planet, and it was really deep to have all of the artists there,\u201d says League. \u201cSo much music has come out of the mixture of cultures in the city, and we had a microcosm of that in the studio. It just felt like the right place to be.\u201d\n\nThe one artist who could not join for the sessions was master Afro-pop singer Salif Keita, who fell ill and was unable to travel. League made the trip to Mali and recorded Keita\u2019s part on \u201cSoro (Afriki)\u201d in his home studio\u2014truly an unforgettable experience. Both the original plan and the adjustment are a tribute to Snarky Puppy\u2019s soaring ambition; \u201cWe try to turn obstacles into opportunities,\u201d says League.\n\nWith Family Dinner - Volume Two complete, Snarky Puppy is back on the road, continuing their perpetual touring schedule, and working on their next recording, which will be their first studio album in seven years (\u201cTo me, that\u2019s weird\u2014recording in front of people is what we do,\u201d says League). But the exposure to so many genres and the creation of such a variety of combinations will stay with these musicians forever.\n\n\u201cThe homework we did on these styles feeds into the general pot of knowledge and experience we pull from every night,\u201d says League. \u201cWe talk to the artists about their music, their rhythms\u2014that\u2019s who we are as people. We want to learn. To us, it\u2019s not about being rich or recognized, but about surrounding ourselves with people who can help us grow. That\u2019s what keeps you humble and hungry.\u201d\n\nAnd numbering the volumes of the Family Dinner series is the giveaway that Snarky Puppy plans to continue doing these projects for a long time. \u201cDifferent places, different artists- there are so many potential variations that you get a unique personality every time,\u201d says League. \u201cIf you get the right blend of people in the room, it will keep working. We\u2019ll do it as long as we can.\u201d\n\nWritten by Alan Light", "otherInfo": "The man behind Derek Smalls of Spinal Tap, voice of Mr. Burns/Ned Flanders/Principal Skinner/Smithers and so many more from the Simpsons, and Saturday Night Live alumnus among countless other titles, Harry Shearer will speak with Michael League about seeking, unleashing, and organizing your creative potential.\n\nEntry is based on a donation basis between $1-100.

Following the success of Patience they released the album \"Beautiful World\" which topped sales in 2006 & sold more then the current release by Robbie!\n\nDuring 2007 Take That also wrote a song for the motion picure Stardust titled Rule the World which reached number 2 in the UK charts and went on to be the 5th biggest selling single of 2007.

It's a timely - and timeless - version of a sound that's existed for 50 years, ever since pioneers like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Bothers Band blurred the lines between rock, country, and amplified folk music. If That Santa Fe Channel nods to the band's influences, though, it's still a fiercely unique album, recorded in a series of live takes that shine a light not only on Cordovas' songwriting chops, but their strength as a raw, rugged live band, as well.\n\nThat Santa Fe Channel was produced by the Milk Carton Kids' Kenneth Pattengale in East Nashville, not far from the home that doubles as the band's rehearsal space, headquarters, and shared living quarters. There, in a converted barn behind the property's main house, the guys logged countless hours fine-tuning a sound that's already earned praise from outlets like NPR Music and Rolling Stone, who described the group as \"the harmony-heavy, guitar-fueled house band at a Big Pink keg party in 1968.\" With its western wooziness and siesta-friendly swagger, That Santa Fe Channel also nods to the band's other home bases: Southern California, where bassist and band leader Joe Firstman lived for years; and Todos Santos, Mexico, where Cordovas' five members travel every winter to write new songs, sharpen old standbys, and oversee the acclaimed Tropic of Cancer Concert Series. The result is a record that's steeped in - but not limited to - southern sounds and California charm. It's American music without borders.\n\nYears before Cordovas' formation, Firstman traveled the country as a solo musician. Raised in North Carolina, he moved to Hollywood as a determined 20 year-old, signing a major-label deal with Atlantic Records in 2002. His debut album, War of Women, hit stores one year later. When a dizzying blur of acclaimed shows - including opening dates for Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson - weren't enough to satisfy the expectations of a big-budget record label, Firstman lost his contract and took a new job as music director on Last Call with Carson Daly. It was good work, with Firstman performing nightly alongside first-rate musicians like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. Still, the need to create his own music was ever-present. With Cordovas, he's found his ultimate vehicle: a collaborative band with multiple lead singers and a collective approach not only to songwriting, but to existing. Cordovas aren't just bandmates. They're roommates. They're co-conspirators. They're a family.\n\n\"The Cordovas are a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week job,\" clarifies Firstman, who shares the band's roster with drummer Graham Spillman, keyboardist Sevans Henderson, and dueling lead guitarists Lucca Soria and Toby Weaver. \"You're always on call to play, to adapt to another man's idea, to pick up a guitar or look at a lyrics sheet. We're eating dinner together, hanging out together, and making art. We don't have rehearsal times, because rehearsal is always. You have to honor the art first, and everything else comes second.\"\n\nLiving in such close quarters - both at home and on the road - has turned Cordovas into a band of brothers. Stop by the band's East Nashville compound and you may find Soria and Weaver picking their way through bluegrass songs inside the barn, while Firstman wraps up a family dinner in the kitchen and Spillman fixes the band's RV outside. There's a communal vibe to the band's existence that bleeds over into their songs, where it's often hard to pinpoint a single person's voice in those thick, swooning harmonies. That Santa Fe Channel is the soundtrack to that communal existence: a collection of songs written together, performed together, and lived together.\n\nAnd what a soundtrack it is. There's the Band-influenced boogie-woogie of \"Standin' on the Porch,\" full of blue notes and pedal steel. There's the layered melodies of \"I'm the One Who Needs You Tonight,\" the classic chord changes of \"Selfish Loner,\" the barroom piano of \"Step Back Red,\" and the hungover charm of the album's opener, \"This Town's a Drag,\" which finds Firstman searching for illegal thrills in a dry town. Together, That Santa Fe Channel's nine songs paint the picture of a band on the rise, heading for a horizon whose beauty can match their own.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Charli XCX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8363770.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Experimental, Pop, Other", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Lion Babe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9073688.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "R&b", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LION BABE IS A NEW YORK BRED FUNK AND SOUL DUO COMPRISED OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY ARTIST JILLIAN HERVEY AND PRODUCER/DJ LUCAS GOODMAN, (ALSO KNOWN AS ASTRO RAW.)

But if she was wandering around America in 2019, what the hell would she say?\u201d wonders Siri Undlin of indie-folk band Humbird. Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota and inspired by the crystalline chill of the state\u2019s Northern winters, Undlin creates experimental folk and environmental Americana tinged with the sophistication of classic\norchestral compositions. Her upcoming album Pharmakon, out August 30, focuses on women and the female body in folklore as a poetic way to explore the human experience. Working with engineer Brian Joseph (Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens) and producer Shane Leonard (Field Report), Undlin\u2019s newest release joins the leagues of masterful indie storytellers.\n\nGrowing up the child of a Lutheran preacher and a trial lawyer, Undlin witnessed the power of stories in her childhood home and began writing music and performing in her church choir from a young age. Her voice, which contains the unwavering fortitude of hymnal melodies, reveals her traditional background. Paired with Undlin\u2019s knack for eccentric musical arrangements and unpredictable, fresh modes of storytelling, Pharmakon bounces between two worlds, never lingering in one for long.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that this dynamic, oscillating motion inspired the creation of Undlin\u2019s upcoming release. \u201cWhen I was writing these songs, I was moving between extremes and trying to look at things differently,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cI was exploring the black and the white and then the gray.\u201d The word \u201cpharmakon,\u201d defined by Plato, is the concept that something can either be the poison or the cure, depending on how much one consumes. \u201cI love that idea, of the two polarizing sides of something that could either be the answer or kill you,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cAnd I think the concept is suited to the album. It was written over an intense period of a couple of years,\nwhere I was redefining my own power in music.\u201d Dotted by highs and lows, this period of time didn\u2019t always feel victorious. However, the final product is a resolute album that brings attention to the universality of women\u2019s experiences throughout time. Inspired by myths and stories such as the legend of Persephone, a modern retelling of Eve\u2019s ancient dilemma, and Angela Carter\u2019s heroine-themed fairytales, Undlin crosses centuries and cultures. \u201cThe track \u2018Wolf Alice\u2019 is inspired by Carter\u2019s version of the fairytale of the same name, which became a vehicle to talk about the attempted \u2018civilizing\u2019 of women\u2019s bodies as an oppressive force throughout human history,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cOn \u2018Eve Boards A Train,\u2019 I imagined Eve getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden and into America\nin 2019. In this story, Eve has boarded a train and is writing a letter to someone .\u201d Just as the characters in these tales didn\u2019t always know which turns they were going to take, Undlin is coming to enjoy the mystery of the creative process. \u201cThere\u2019s this myth that comes with being an artist that there\u2019s gonna be this one defining moment of success where everything suddenly makes sense,\u201d says Undlin. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s actually a crock of shit.\u201d Though she admits that the process of creating a brave album can be fraught with pain and disappointments, Undlin\u2019s upcoming release is nothing short of triumphant. Along with the heroines of the fairytales that inspire her, Undlin is fearlessly blazing ahead, no matter where the winding forest path might take her.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Linda Perry ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/134330.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born on April 15, 1965, in Springfield, MA, Linda Perry spent her youth struggling with kidney disease and then addiction before focusing on music. Growing up in an artistic and musical household, the young Perry displayed a good share of musical\ntalent and interest from an early age. During her teenage years, Perry floundered in school and tried unsuccessfully to form several bands in the San Diego area. A drug problem prevented the singer/guitarist from starting off her career at an early age, but after a few close calls and a move to San Fransisco in the late '80s, she cleaned up and began making some real artistic and professional gains. During this period, Perry discovered and refined her powerful singing voice. Part Grace Slick, part Johnnette Napolitano, but unique in her own right and a little quirky, it didn't take long before Perry's solo performances at various Bay Area nightclubs were attracting the attention of scenesters and fellow musicians. One such musician was Christa Hillhouse, who was in quest of a new lead vocalist for her group 4 Non Blondes. Hillhouse asked Perry to join up with her outfit, which also included Shauna Hall and Wanda Day. Perry agreed to give it a try and it wasn't long before 4 Non Blondes were being courted and eventually signed by Interscope Records. The group's debut, Bigger, Better, Faster, More, was released on Interscope in 1992. After a very slow start sales-wise, the David Tickle-produced album began to break in 1993 when a modern rock disc jockey in Las Vegas began spinning \"What's Up?\" Interscope then began pushing the song, which had by this time developed a life of its own. A video was produced and MTV took an immediate and prolonged shine it, giving the band massive exposure. As \"What's Up?\" became a huge international hit, 4 Non Blondes seemed to be everywhere. During a period of about two years, Perry and her bandmates appeared on the Airheads and Wayne's World 2 soundtracks, released two more singles and accompanying videos (for \"Spaceman\" and \"Dear Mr. President\"), toured the globe, appeared on Carpenters and Led Zeppelin tribute releases, and finally appeared on Roger Daltrey's televised 50th birthday party, which ended up being their final performance. While working on their follow-up to the six-million-unit-selling Bigger, Better, Faster, More, Perry left the group due to personal problems within the band. After departing 4 Non Blondes, Perry began work on some solo material and formed her own label, Rockstar Records, which later signed Stone Fox and 2 Lane Blacktop. Perry also began a producing and session career by joining Stone Fox in the studio and helping out on former Bangle Susanna Hoffs' self-titled solo disc. Perry herself was joined by the likes of Grace Slick, Lisa Germano, and Sheryl Crow producer Bill Bottrell on In Flight, her 1996 solo debut. Darker, and more dynamic than her work with 4 Non Blondes, Perry came into her own as an artist on this exceptional recording. Released on Interscope, In Flight was perhaps too dour or sincere to capitalize on the alt-pop success of 4 Non Blondes and the record was hardly noticed by critics, radio, or fans. After In Flight, Perry moved to Southern California and continued working on production and film projects, as well as running her label. In 1999, she released her second solo effort, the stripped-down, almost bluesy After Hours. A fine vocalist, writer, and musician, Linda Perry has led a serious and occasionally subversive career, punctuated by her individualism and sense of artistic purpose", "otherInfo": "Youtube Live - \"On the Air with We Are Hear\" Fundraiser for MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Jenny Yang ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "mxmtoon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10013898.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ali in the Jungle ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10394808.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Art Rock, Indie, Indie Rock, Alternative", "Time": "7:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Ali In The Jungle have been swapping instruments and jumpers in front of live audiences since 2013.

Her introduction\nto jazz was the result of the fortuitous location of her upbringing, the village Samois\u00adsur\u00adSeine\u2014the\nsame place where legendary gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt had lived. Every June for decades,\ngypsies have descended upon Samois, setting up caravans in nearby meadows for the annual Django Reinhardt Festival. During those June nights many years ago, after her parents would fall asleep, a\nyoung, curious Aim\u00e9e would climb out her bedroom window and wander into the gypsy encampments.\nAim\u00e9e would sing by the fire with Django\u2019s descendents and began to fall in love with the gypsy way of\nlife\u2014scampering home before the sun rose. Explained Aim\u00e9e, \"I was hypnotized by gypsy music which\nmade me want to tap my feet\u037e music that swings makes me so happy.\"\nAs a teenager, Aim\u00e9e performed in various Parisian caf\u00e9s and clubs. When her family moved to\nSingapore, she remained in Paris to attend the American School of Modern Music.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label. It provided the perfect outlet for their numerous production projects \u2013 Oceanlab, Aalto, Freestate, Nitromethane, POS, Rollerball and Tranquillity Base \u2013 and every release was warmly received by elite DJ\u2019s and club-goers across the globe.\n\nIn late 2002 James Grant joined the Anjunabeats management team and the label began to expand its output, signing a series of fresh artists. The first external track to be released was Rusch and Murray\u2019s much talked about \u2018Epic\u2019 \u2013 a track made entirely across Internet forums by two producers who\u2019ve never met \u2013, with subsequent signings including Finnish trance maestro Super8 (who later joined forces with DJ Tab), talented UK duo Smith & Pledger and Dutch Deep Tech Genius, Stephen J.Kroos.\n\nSince then, the roster has expanded to over 30 artists and Anjunabeats has earned a reputation as one the most consistent dance labels in the world, with its releases proving to be essential tools for many of the world's top DJs. In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

It was during these formative years that Fokis developed a love for music and a work ethic that placed him amongst hip hop\u2019s hardest working entrepreneurs. Fokis began rhyming at an early age and later began to produce his own music. Seeking to enhance his career, Fokis pursued formal training as a recording engineer, later opening his own recording studio Krystal Clear Recordings. There, Fokis recorded and mixed for many artists including Big Daddy Kane, Fat Joe, Skyzoo, Torae, Dres, N.O.R.E, Kool G Rap, Brand Nubian, Chi-Ali, Ras Kass, Mic Geranimo, Bubba Sparxx and Rahsaan Patterson. His passion and commitment to succeed literally placed him on the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d. Early in his career, Fokis developed an online reality show based on his own experience as an independent hip hop artist seeking to secure a record deal within a year\u2019s time. Consistent with reality, the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d did not result in Fokis signing a record deal. Not deterred, Fokis went on to release several albums collaborating with various artists such as Joe Budden, Olu Dara (Nas\u2019 father), Deemi, Joell Ortiz and various producers such as Ty Fyffe, Focus\u2026(Aftermath Ent.) Fantom Of The Beat and Jake One. Fokis released various projects including the \u201c20/20\u201d EP exclusively produced by Focus of Aftermath \u201cRecognize Your Power\u201d EP with Edo. G & Shabaam Sahdeeq which was produced entirely by Fokis, \"This Thing Called Life\" which was produced by Oh No. all of which were well received by his fans.\n\nFokis has toured the United States and abroad, performed as an opening act for artists such as Common, Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., The Beatnuts, Onyx, Das Efx, Masta Ace and more. Through his experiences, Fokis developed a relevant broad appealing style and sound that remains true to the core foundational elements of Hip Hop with a commercial appeal. Though achieving success releasing his own music, Fokis realized in this era it would take more than pursuing a career as a recording artist to rise to the level of success he sought to achieve. As his experience with the business side of the industry grew, Fokis established his own independent record label, Loyalty Digital Corp. Through his label, Fokis has worked with and Executive produced projects like \u201cAn Ode To Reasonable Doubt\u201d by Skyzoo & Antman Wonder, \u201cBarrel Brothers\u201d by Skyzoo & Torae, \u201cNever Left\u201d by Sadat X and various others. Most recently, Fokis has created a membership based artist and producer collective called Local-Mu12. The members span from all over the world and are wrapping up their third LP for release this year. Fokis & Loyalty Digital\u2019s many achievements have been recognized by various blogs such as Complex, HipHopDX, NahRight, 2DopeBoyz, RapRadar, XXL and The Source to name a few.

The Edmonton, Kentucky-based rock n\u2019 roll quartet Black Stone Cherry was raised on musical forefathers such as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Muddy Waters, and the Faces, among other 1970s staples, and, now, with its sixth album, Family Tree, BSC salutes its classic rock heritage and honors its legacy with a beast of a Southern rock n\u2019 roll album.\n\n\u201cWe caught divine intervention with this one,\u201d guitarist Ben Wells says with a good chuckle. \u201cWe hit a creative spark and tapped into a spirit and a fire we hadn\u2019t before.\u201d Drummer John Fred Young adds: \u201cFamily Tree showcases all of our collective musical influences and how we have taken those to create something that is truly our own unique Southern American Rock \u2018N Roll Sound.\u201d\n\nFor 17 years, Black Stone Cherry has put forth a new vicious breed of Southern rock, injecting youthful vitality and a myriad of fresh new influences into the beloved American rock tradition. To date, the band has released five critically acclaimed albums, and one well-received blues EP. Black Stone Cherry has also rocked 12,000-cap arena shows, topped the UK charts, and shared the stage with a diverse roster of superstars, including Def Leppard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bad Company, M\u00f6torhead, and ZZ Top.\n\nBlack Stone Cherry came together in 2001 in Edmonton, Kentucky, eventually coalescing around the lineup of Chris Robertson, vocals and guitar; Ben Wells, guitar and vocals; Jon Lawhon, bass and vocals; and John Fred Young, drums. Young's dad Richard, and his Uncle Fred, are two members of the iconic country-fried rock n\u2019 roots band The Kentucky HeadHunters, and the high school-aged boys came up honing their craft in the group\u2019s Practice House, a 1940s bungalow.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in the Kentucky Headhunters\u2019 rehearsal space, looking up at posters of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Stones, Montrose, and the Faces. We were like kids someone took in a time capsule and put in the woods,\u201d says drummer John Fred Young.\n\nLike the band\u2019s previous album and EP, Black Stone Cherry opted to self-produce and track Family Tree at David Barrick's Barrick Recording, the same studio where BSC recorded its self-titled debut and Kentucky albums . BSC also opted to not over-rehearse in advance of the album, instead preferring the immediacy and spontaneity of in the-moment takes. \u201cThere was a lot of laughter in the studio this time, and an air of comfort because we had self-produced the last few releases. It helped us get down to the nitty gritty bones of our music,\u201d says bassist Jon Lawhon. The band also entrusted guitarist and vocalist Chris Robertson to mix the album. This homespun approach perfectly suited the loose but epiphanic creative sessions that birthed Family Tree.\n\nFamily Tree boasts BSC\u2019s tried-and-true lucky number with its 13 songs, and, like all BSC releases, features songwriting contributions from each member. The result is a modern and meaty blues-based rock album, with unexpected sonic twists like punchy horn sections, barrelhouse pianos, Southern gospel organ, atmospheric synthesizer passages, and forays into funk and country.\n\nThe title track melds brawny blues riffage with BSC\u2019s most telepathic ensemble playing, showcasing the group\u2019s maturation as a unit without detracting from its Southern, hard rock wallop. The album also packs some satisfyingly surprising moments. \u201cCarry Me On Down The Road\u201d is a sleek slice of pure 1970s American rock n\u2019 roll\u2014something you would hear blaring out of a 1972 Chevy El Camino. \u201cJames Brown\u201d offers forth some stanky swamp-funk, replete with wah-wah guitars and gospel girl vocals. \u201cBad Habit,\u201d however, dripping sensual innuendo hammered home by a horny groove-rock beat, delivers some prime hooky and heavy BSC.\n\nOne Family Tree centerpiece is the rustically elegant \u201cMy Last Breath,\u201d a sweetly downhome ode to the unbreakable bonds of family. The song\u2019s goose bump-inducing call and response male and female vocal breakdown is one of those musical moments where light just shines through the speakers and you know everything is going to be alright.\n\nTwo special guests bring Family Tree full circle, one being Chris\u2019 5 year-old son singing backup on the brawny swaggering \u201cYou Got The Blues,\u201d and the other being jam band icon Warren Haynes\u2019 vocal and guitar cameo on the delta stomp of \u201cDancing In The Rain.\u201d The band first met Warren 17 years ago when they first came to New York to showcase for their new label. \u201cI remember coming to New York when we first were signed, and hearing Warren\u2019s voice behind me the minute my feet hit the street,\u201d recalls bassist Jon Lawhon. \u201cHearing him play on this track all these years later gave me chills.\u201d\n\nHaving Warren guest on the album was a wonderful gesture of \u201cyou\u2019re in the family now.\u201d It was truly a validation of all the miles the band has clocked on tour, and the dues the guys have paid being away from home. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how four good old boys from nowhere Kentucky can still be around 17 years later,\u201d singer/guitarist Chris Robertson says.

It will include 11 brand new songs. This will be the first record that he has recorded & produced in his own home studio in Co. Armagh. There will also be a special limited edition of the album available only on the benreel.com website, which will include 5 bonus tracks. Since his debut back in 1999, each album has gone from strength to strength, touching on different styles of music from rock,soul,blues, Alt Folk/Americana & with the occasional injection of reggae. This was highlighted on his 2012, 18 song best of album (Ben Reel 1999-2009 Compilation 10) released only as a limited edition for loyal fans to buy at gigs, also available on iTunes worldwide. Ben\u2019s music has evolved into an honest earthy sound that has matured like a fine wine and he has very much his own sound today. This can be heard on this new album. Darkness & The Light is a powerful soulful album with deep meaningful lyrics and memorable epic anthemic songs, with strong melodies combined with imaginitive expansive arrangements. Recorded digitally but with an analog feeling of warmth. The songs deal with the struggles of life of ordinary folk since the global economic crash. Also probing for spiritual meaning and balance between the Yin and the Yang, trying to find light, hope and healing in these troubled times. Serious songs from a serious artist in a serious moment in time. In the last 10 years he has had numerous high profile TV & Radio appearances and airplay under his belt including Bob Harris BBC Radio 2 and has supported names like Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and appeared as a special guest at one of Hal Ketchum's shows in Dublin.

His band includes amongst the finest musicians in Ireland, his brother in law Michael Black on Drums, Ronnie O\u2019Flynn on bass and Mick McCarney on guitar. With this line up they have built up a loyal underground following. Ben is often described as an \u2018artist lying beneath the radar for way too long\u2019. In 2011 Ben played showcase gigs in Nashville & Memphis (Folk Alliance) where he colloborated with some of Nashville's finest, David Olney, Sergio Webb & Irene Kelley to name a few. Plans are in the pipeline to return to the U.S in 2013 to promote his new record and to follow up on his success on Airplaydirect.com radio download rock chart, which he has been number 1 for the last 3 months. Plus he will be touring extensively in Ireland, UK & Europe.

Rainy Nights nails down the pang of loneliness that emigrants feel when they are far from home and someone says something that just triggers regret. The easy, soulful melody and performance underlines the impact, with Reel\u2019s singing striking just the right note. It is the high point of the album. Though Feel Alive , the title track and the gospel of Old Bog Road come close. The Armagh singer-songwriter comes across as a honest man determined to use his love of music to best effect, and he is lucky in having a band, particularly guitarist Mick McCarney, full of expression and no little skill. www.benreel.com Download tracks: Rainy Nights, Time to Get Real http://dvdfever.co.uk/reviews/erbenreel.shtml Elly Roberts reviews The Ben Reel Band: Time To Get Real Another little gem from the Emerald Isle. Rating: 8/10 Irishman Ben Reel has consistently released solid albums over the past 10 years. My last CD encounter was 2007\u2019s fabulous New Horizon. Now on his fifth album, Time To Get Real, keeps that tradition well and truly alive with a dazzling collection of Americana crossover songs that ought to have ears pricking at all the \u2018real music\u2019 stations. Reel has a penchant for ignoring fads and trends keeping the focus on real music which is why he\u2019s become a cult artist in his native Ireland, though sadly he hasn\u2019t been picked up as genuine singer-songwriter in the UK. Everybody in the business knows he\u2019s hot stuff having supported Jools Holland, Alabama 3, The Cranberries and stage star Michael Ball no less. The good news is he doing rather well in Holland, Belgium and Germany. As an introduction to the album he\u2019s released Feel Alive as a single. The down and dirty groove has some sublime guitar licks carried by a great melody and his rough edged vocals. ________________________________________ This box of delights opens with a gentle country shuffle in the form of Rainy Night as the band moves with confidence and swagger, again with Reel dropping in some superb guitar breaks and a fine line in vocal gymnastics including falsetto along with a Neil Young-like harmonica swish. The introduction of songbird Julieanne Reek on the deliciously tender love ballad Summers Always Here only adds to the romantic mood. With a troubled heart he gushes with lyrics like \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re like the warm summer sun that\u2019s rising / Feel your warm love in my heart / Melting away the cold ice of winter / The storms have passed / There\u2019s a new life on the way.\u201d Embracing an eclectic mindset, Keep On Drivin\u2019 takes on a C.C.Rider rockabilly hue drenched in honeyed vocals, stylish pedal steel, thumping basslines and wah wah, whereas Time Slips Away is deeply reflective, yearning for his childhood days and the onset of wisdom now he\u2019s turned 35. A heavy funky bass, rolling organ, and acoustic chords make Who You Are the albums catchiest song, with the main hook coming in the chorus. For Old And Wise Reel delves deep into a more traditional Irish template which brings forward his wishes not to die a typical rock\u2019n\u2019roll death \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t wanna overdose like a rockin-roll star /Or choke on my vomit after whiskey in the jar.\u201d By far the best song on the album, closes it \u2013 the stripped back dusty-bowl ballad Old Bog Road. Reverbed harmonica leads to gentle acoustic picks, chords slabs and wailing solos, on what is essentially a mournful ballad. The verdict \u2013 Quality album. http://www.billybop.be/admin/CDdetail.asp?ID=8717 Ben Reel : Time To Get Real \u2013 CD, BRBCDA-007;B Reel Records Album Kindly Submitted by G-Promotions Style : Americana Rate (1-5) : Ben Reel is the latest addition to a series of Americana artists emerging from Ireland! Against the backdrop of the troubles in Northern Ireland, Ben first picked up his guitar when he was 15 years old inspired by greats like Bruce Springsteen or Neil Young. Today this inspirations are still to be found in his passionate music! Leading track \u201cRainy Night\u201d is one of those tunes that you start to whistle along without ever having it heard before! Country and Americana are the main genres on this album but this doesn\u2019t mean the album is limited to it. On \u201cFeel Alive\u201d Ben comes with some enjoyable soul influences while \u201cKeep on drivin\u2019\u201d throws in a lot of country as does \u201cLooking for a Lost Horizon\u201d. \u201cOld & Wise\u201d throws in some old styles and mix folk influences into this Americana tune. On \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d the title track of this album, Ben Reel, returns to his old habits and creates a song that could be from the hand of \u201cThe Boss\u201d. Closing down the album is \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d that opens with a beautiful haunting blues harp. The haunting keeps going on, both with his voice and slide guitar! As an extra, hidden track we can hear a nice rockabilly kind of version (Live) of Keep on Drivin\u2019 in a mix with the classic \u201cTrain Train\u201d Time To Get Real is already the fifth album for Ben Reel and in the past two years he has successfully toured Holland, Belgium and Germany steady working on a growing fan base. Back you\u2019ll can find him as supporting act for bands like the Cranberries, Alabama 3 or Jools Holland. The album is a true Americana effort and comes with handful of interesting tunes that makes me feel that this artist need to be in the spotlight a little more. Mr Blue Boogie http://www.getreadytorock.com/reviews2009/ben_reel.htm BEN REEL Time To Get Real (2009) Play this new Ben Reel CD to any music aficionado, and ask them where it was recorded. Nine out of ten would say Nashville. Guaranteed. Now, Ben Reel may not be a household name (yet), but let's assume for a moment his work is unfamiliar to you. OK, what genre music would you say Time To Get Real was? No problem - southern, country blues rock. And name any influences you can hear at play? Again, no problem - Neil Young is an obvious one, but also Springsteen and perhaps Chris Isaak and even a little Clapton circa 361 Ocean Boulevard. So, nationality? No brainer - a man from the deep south of the US of A. Wrong on all accounts, because Time To Get Real is the 5th album in 10 years from Irish guitarist and singer songwriter Ben Reel. And naturally it was recorded in Monaghan in the north of the emerald isle. In reviewing Ben's last album New Horizon (2007) - which had an altogether more 'west coast' feel - we pondered on image, and what might make Ben stand out from the likes of Marc Cohn. It may be that with Time to Get Real, and diving deep into Americana, Ben has found his niche. Beautifully played and recorded it's bound to strike a chord with the market that's fuelling the resurgence of Neil Young, and Springsteen's exploration of the American psyche. But the challenge is still to get his music across the pond. It's not easy to crack America - many have tried and failed, but the rootsy warmth of the songs, the soulful singing and classy playing (some wonderful blues guitar and harmonica work) would undoubtedly be lapped up with a little exposure. So remember the name - Ben Reel - a real class act. *** Review by Pete Whalley http://www.lonesomehighway.com/pdf/online-issue-7.pdf Ben Reel Time To Get Real B. Reel Northern Ireland native Ben Reel has delivered a roots album that is full of strong songs and good playing. There\u2019s some solid keyboard playing, a rhythm section that drives things along and some very tasty guitar from Mick McCarney. Reel\u2019s voice is accompanied by welcome backing vocals that help to portray the mood of the songs. Rainy Night sets the tone for time and place, a song that looks at what has been missed by moving away from your home town. Other topics are ageing, freedom, the nature of searching and of truth. Mature songs for a mature audience that\u2019s given a melodic and malleable musical base that could just as easily have come from the States as from Northern Ireland. Reel no doubt has taken from those who have also come from the North, such as the undeniable influence of Van Morrison as a beacon of musical innovation. Reel does not have Morrison\u2019s track record, but this is an album that shows all the signs of a true talent making his own way. It\u2019s time to get serious is the signal Ben Reel gives with the release of his latest cd \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he before? Haven\u2019t got a clue because for me Ben Reel is a complete stranger. He is (northern) Irish and has been working at his craft for quite some time. \u201cTime to Get Reel\u201d sure is a good way to get to know him and the cd is full of piercing impulses. Delicate songs, strongly carried by the accompanying musicians, but by no tarnishing ben\u2019s Vocals. (His vocals show comparisons to Rod MacDonald and John Stewart). I hope that I grow old and wise suggests that Ben has come to an age where he starts realising his own mortality, what undoubtedly determines the profundity you find again in his lyrics. With what I don\u2019t want to affect his compositions. As I said before, I only know Reels past from what I read in his biography, But \u201cTime to get Reel\u201d indeed looks like the start of a new development, a new awakening. No trace of a personal crisis. My guts tell me Ben Reel has defined he wants to make a good product. One he will be remembered by. The closing song \u201cOld Bog Road\u201d tells of a permanent goodbye Ben Reel manages to create a excellent variation of styles, and within a limited nr of spins I still a real positive feeling about Ben Reel. Serious, skilful. driven \u2026. (after the official songs there is a hidden track, a live song, where you hear the presence of a modern day Elvis. Not renewed, but very entertaining. www.rootstime.be /Rein van den Berg Oct 09 The Irish hearts are often rather melancholic. Maybe the beautiful sceneries see to a tendensy of warmth and retirement. It characterizes at any rate the dark songs of Ben Reel, which the cover of the newest album, time to get real, suggest. Eleven songs written by reel himself and richly arranged with violin, piano, appropriate guitar lines and a choice of extra additioned instruments. With this the Irish know how to display a large scale of spheres and feelings, carying names as Neil Young and sometimes Bob Dylan. Indeed in rags, because Ben Reel is a slippery costumer. Ben\u2019s first album, \u201cthis is the movie\u201d, came out in Ireland in 1999, after this the EP \u00ebxorcise me\u201d(2000) only with 3 tracks, which seemed to be forerunner for his second album \u201cLost in Haze\u201d (2001). After that came Sweet Victory (2004), U People (2006) and New Horizon (2007). We don\u2019t have to complain about man\u2019s releases and qualities: guitarplayer Ben Reel, born in silverbridge but now living in Castlebalyney, is a supreme storyteller; has a pleasant voice, writes, beside that, upperclass songs and has also the quality to gather very able musicians around him. At his new album Ben Reel is accompanied again by a fine equilibiated band: Ronnie, Michael. Mickey, John, Colin. And now we are calling names: the recordings were done in the Attic studios with producer Ronan who also has a vocal contribution in the last two songs. In the quite openers Rainy Summers etc. we hear Reel\u2019s wife Julieanne who takes the change of the singing second. Anyway, in their natural but yet larger soundscape is more than enough space for improvisation and variety, which we can hear clearly on their new album. What Ben has settled with this successor is impressing. In 11 songs the band knows to create an oppressing atmosphere, which gets enlightened only now and then. Rasping and grating, then again with deceptive lovely acoustic guitars, then with thin guitarsounds and spacious violin, the listener is taking to a voyage through the Deep South of the mind, which only can turn out bad. It is oppressing, dark, stirring and especially very beautiful. Roots, pop and folk are going hand in hand with now and then an experimental strain. The point is that Ben Reel makes magnificent music. Music that mixes influences from alt-country with the atmospheric and darkness the music from Ireland so often charcterizes. Music that attracts attention by the variety and the highstanding music, because they really can play. Ben Reel searches, with his new album, joining with the greatness of the alt-country, but takes here at the same time surrender. Time to get real is just a good patterncard of the ability of the Ben Reel Band. Everything sounds beautiful, clear and especially respectable. The sharp ends are removed expertly and almost everything is produced in a way that it has to be specially accessed for the singersongwriter radiosize.

There's lots to inspire and Ben Reel has absorbed those influences and let them inform his particular style of travelling blues. \"Time To Get Real\" isn't a classic troubadour album, but it is deep hearted blues packed with characters, places and just a wee bit of drinking. The songs are strong through out, all could standalone without being thought of as filler. Time to step up from being a solid support to being the headliner. BELGUIM http://www.ctrlaltcountry.be/Pagina1.htm#BenReel BEN REEL \u201cTime To Get Real\u201d (Ben Reel) (3,5****) Ireland has long been enjoying a good reputation, where the singer-songwriters are concerned. And with Ben Reel has another one to be proud of. With \"Time To Get Real\" the man has just delivered his fifth album in ten years time, and that is a very beautiful album. Reel is gifted with a warm, a little soulful vocal style, shows himself a truly excellent song smith and professional manner together in genres like rock, pop, folk, Americana and blues into his songs. He calls himself Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young as inspiration, but there really is not much sign of that. Reel sounds like a particularly original. Someone with a vision of his own writing and placing songs. Someone with an own sound. And it would absolutely not surprise us if he behave the songs on \"Time To Get Real\" soon break on larger scale. He fully deserves it already! Songs like it a little reminiscent of Neil Young \"Rainy Night\", the beautifully subdued piano and harmonica work on-going rootspopdeuntje \"Summer's Always Here\", the soulful rockin 'Feel Alive', the bluesy bounce \"Keep On Drivin '\", the summer, somewhere between pop, folk and country resident \"Old & Wise\" is simply magnificent.

(SWA) REAL ROOTS CAF\u00c9 Netherlands Dutch to English translation Very recently came from Time to get real, the fifth full-time CD of Irish singer-songwriter Ben Reel. For me a great unknown, but already 20 years active in music since he was a teenager in 1989 founded his first band, \"Trim the Velvet '. After the breakup of this band eight years later, Ben's solo tour in 1999 and came from his solo CD's available. With five number one so he just scored an average of two years each. Ben's music is best described as Irish mid-tempo alt-country, the songs are nice sound and treat a number of pressing issues for Ben. He describes one part of his life and Rainy Night Time just slips away, do proclaim his feelings, especially love, respect, in four songs and shares his thoughts with us and future expectations in another four songs. He concludes (No. 11 is) a kind of summary of this in Old Bog Road: Seasons change as people come and go, life and death is the endless flow. Want to find the answers, because the story to be told, is not gonna quit the mining for gold. Want to find a reason before I go. Before they take my body, down that old bog road. Heavy thoughts for a guy who has several years of the 40 removed. But we are not all looking for the deeper meaning of life? Incidentally, after more than six minutes of the final number is still nearly six minutes a lasting valve closure, which Ben totally in style and tempo rocking (leading to a sodden organ) announces yet another time by a wish to: (I 'll) keep on driving, a live concert recording and a perfect valve. Always funny, some unexpected hidden track. Ben's band was great response and are in addition to Ben's acoustic guitar (and occasional harmonica) bass, drums and electric guitar. A few songs do keyboards and violin along. Ben has a somewhat gritty but pleasant voice. His wife Julianne sings along to eight songs, four songs is half Bloch (e, you never know with those Irish first names) to hear. I think it's a good CD, especially through the expressiveness of the songs both lyrically and in terms of melody (Fred Schmale) Put simply and aptly, New Horizon is all killer, no filler! Rarely have I heard an album so complete and so fully realised. From the brilliance of the playing and arranging to the magnificence of Reel's voice, this is heaven all the way. A superb album by an artist good enough to hold his own in rock\u2019s premiere league. Andrew Hobbs, Hi Fi + magazine When it comes to making classy albums, Ben Reel's your man. Year on year, Reel's songwriting is growing in stature in every department, yet he still doesn't get the wide spread recognition he richly deserves it's one of the strongest albums this year. This CD isn't just music: it's art. AllGigs.co.uk review of New Horizon, 8th October 2007 Ben Reel, a native of South Armagh, has in the words of one journalist \u2018operated under the media\u2019s radar for far too long\u2019. On the evidence of this release, his fourth album, I would have to agree. The songs and the playing are really impressive, an earthy mix of rock, roots and blues, all mixed lovingly together with soulful vocals. His song writing shows maturity and progression which comes through with repeated plays. Featuring some great slide guitar from Micky McCarney and terrific vocals from Kelie Redmond, \u201cHell In Ur Own Head\u201d is a standout, closely followed by the semi spoken \u201cWhen Will Be Ever Be Free\u201d. \u201cFor U And I\u201d shows the band at their best with a lovely rock/soul groove that you wish would go on longer. All in all this is an impressive album from a major talent who needs further investigation.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON). The Allaire Show features John sharing the stage with local and up-and-coming talent as well as more experienced and established musicians, some who\u2019ve come from as far away as Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\n\nAWARDS\n- American Songwriter Assoc. \"Best Lyrics\" Award 2009 for \"Magnets\" (Nashville, TN)\n\n- Toronto Independent Music Awards \"Best Live Act\" (2009)\n\n- CBC Telefest top independent music video in Ontario (1989)\n\n- Top independent video in Canada 1989 as selected by MuchMusic\n\n- Canadian College and University Radio Assoc. top album of the month - \"All's Well\" (1989)\n\n- PROCAN (now SOCAN) independent songwriter award for \"Cry at Night\" (1987)", "otherInfo": "Pub Party Fridays brought to you by Flora Hall Brewing.

As a DJ, producer and mogul whose label is at the forefront of modern electronic dance music, it goes without saying that Nicky is a force to be reckoned with. From the iconic hits \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" to his recent #1 US Dance Radio track \u2018Sometimes\u2019 with DallasK & Xylo in 2019. Nicky's resume boasts an impressive and lengthy discography of originals, remixes, edits and co-productions, proving again and again his ability to evolve with the ever-changing landscape of electronic music. Perhaps even more telling of his razor-sharp prowess and visionary mindset is the success and impact of his label Protocol Recordings, setting up recent collaborations with David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.\n\nIn the late 2000's, EDM was having its heyday, and Nicky Romero was at the forefront of the movement that would become one of the most significant cultural resurgences in decades. After releasing several singles early in his career, Nicky officially had his breakthrough moments with the viral anthem \"Toulouse\" and \"I Could Be the One\" (vs. Avicii), which to date has amassed over 185 million streams on Spotify alone. Nicky's meticulous skill as a producer led him to co-producing with legendary artists, both on Rihanna's hit \"Right Now\" and Britney Spears' \"It Should Be Easy.\" These early successes served to pave the way for the founding of Nicky's own label, Protocol Recordings.\n\nNicky created Protocol Recordings in 2012, and in the last six years it has grown from a record label to a truly multi-faceted household name in electronic music - but they're still only getting started. Nicky created Protocol to be a place of camaraderie between forward-thinking artists, always daring to break the mold through innovative sounds. Protocol's diverse list of artists currently includes Raiden, Maximals, Tom Tyger, Florian Picasso, Sunstars, Corey James and many more. To support the development of his artists, Nicky recently built Protocol Studios, a state-of-the-art complex with five production studios, a radio studio, and a live recording studio to encompass the end-to-end musical process. Additionally, the label's successful radio show Protocol Radio reaches over 40 million listeners each week, and its live presence has expanded to showcases at ADE, Miami Music Week and more.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Barenaked Ladies ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8106543.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative, Pop, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Last Summer on Earth Tour 2020 with Gin Blossoms & Toad the Wet Sprocket tickets & VIP are on sale now! #BNL2020 #LSOE2020", "otherInfo": "Who\u2019s ready for another Facebook Live \ud83d\udd34 session?

The multi-faceted Renaissance man proves it on his upcoming new studio album, aptly titled A Whole Lot More To Me, a record that furthers Morgan's reputation as one of the genre's most commanding vocalists.\n\nWhile his singing on such hits as the multi-week Number One \"That\u2019s What I Love About Sunday,\" \"International Harvester,\" \"Bonfire,\" \"This Ole Boy\" and \"Wake Up Lovin' You\" was exemplary, Morgan has somehow found a new level and vocal range in the studio. On his forthcoming LP, his third with label home Black River Entertainment, he's making the most relevant, authentic and moving music of his career. It's a point that \"When I'm Gone\" drives home, as Morgan sings about living life with no regrets.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a renewed energy with this record,\" he says emphatically. \"In fact, I'm at the pinnacle of my career \u2014 producing, singing and touring. And this song epitomizes that. It's about living to the fullest, and when people hear it, I know they'll relate it to their own lives.\"\n\nHis newest single, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon,\u201d is an epic love song and one of many radio-ready hits on Morgan's highly anticipated project. He's written nearly half of the album's dozen tracks, and makes all of them his own. \"I'm That Country\" exudes Southern charm; \"Remind Me Why I'm Crazy\" showcases Morgan the crooner; \"I Can't Wait to Stay\" exults the joys of a small-town life; and \"A Whole Lot More to Me\" is a musical autobiography. The collection\u2019s \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d has already met critical acclaim with Music Row calling it a \u201cpowerhouse performance of a pile-driving song.\u201d Each highlights his artistic renaissance.\n\nMorgan laughs at that word, however: \"artistic.\"\n\n\"I have friends who are very artistic people, sometimes oddly so, and I never wanted to be that guy, to be so artistic that I'm odd,\" he says smiling. \"But it's good to know that I've evolved musically and, with this new record, I've created something with longevity.\"\n\nIndeed, Morgan's A Whole Lot More To Me, co-produced with Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Faith Hill) and released via Black River Entertainment, is a timeless recording. As was their goal, Morgan and Gallimore, with whom he worked for the first time, succeeded in making music that will sound fresh a decade or more from now. These are songs that define a man.\n\nMorgan uses the honesty of the concert stage as an analogy for how he assembled what will be his seventh studio album. \"It would look funny if you went to one of my concerts and I stood out there in skinny jeans. I'm not 21 years old, and I shouldn't pretend to be,\" he says. \"But I also know this music will fit right in on country radio today. I'm singing music that is real and believable and at the same time relatable to all types of fans. That's hard to do, but you can do it if you stay true to who you are.\"\n\nAnd Craig Morgan knows exactly who he is, a man with many sides. Along with being an entertainer, he's an adventure junkie and hosts the popular Outdoor Channel series Craig Morgan: All Access Outdoors, entering its seventh season this summer. He's also a 17-year Army and Army Reserves veteran, a passionate champion of the military, a philanthropist and a celebrated motivational speaker.\n\nHe\u2019s a busy man with a knack for attention to detail. Carefully choosing each lyric on this album is no exception. There is not a single wasted verse \u2014 let alone word \u2014 on the follow-up to 2012's This Ole Boy. \"Every word is valid and relevant on this album,\" he says. \"It's a quality continuation of what I've done in the past.\"\n\nThe most obvious bridge to Morgan's back catalog is the spiritually minded \"Country Side of Heaven.\" The song is inspirational country at its finest, with a soaring chorus that at once elevates both listener and artist.\n\n\"It has a very charismatic, inspirational vibe about it \u2014 but not preachy,\" Morgan says. \"The energy feels spiritual by the time you get to the end and there is an emotional attachment within you that makes you want to hear it again and again.\"\n\nMorgan says the song, as well as album tracks like the emotionally charged \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home Soon\u201d and the empowered-woman tale \"All Cried Out,\" act as a through-line, a path for fans to connect the dots of his career: \"You develop a fan base and they get acquainted with a certain thing from you, and they want that. This album is full of those.\"\n\nAnother standout on the project is \u201cHearts I Leave Behind,\u201d which features Morgan\u2019s gritty and poignant vocals with the soulful Christian rock band Third Day\u2019s lead singer, Mac Powell.\n\nThe hard-touring artist has already been testing out the songs on the road, to stellar results. \"When I'm Gone\" becomes a call to action; \"Country Side of Heaven\" is an audience sing-along; and \"Nowhere Without You,\" written by Michael McDonald, stands as an epic power ballad.\n\n\"It's such an emotional song, one that I can see being played at weddings for a long time,\" he says. \"I feel something in my chest when I hear it. It moves me \u2014 and that's what music is supposed to do.\"\n\nEspecially in the hands of an artist as gifted as Morgan, who can effortlessly toggle between the breezy fun of radio staple \"Redneck Yacht Club\" and the poignancy of \"That's What I Love About Sunday.\" He mixes both approaches in the album's standout track, \"A Whole Lot More to Me.\" A smoldering, jazz-influenced love song with an everyman attitude, it shines a light on a different side of the artist, and country fans in general \u2014 one that likes a fine Cabernet as much as a cold beer, and indulges in sushi by candlelight as regularly as barbecue by the bonfire.\n\n\"As a country singer, we sometimes get stereotyped as nothing but trucks and tailgates, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to us,\" he says, summing up the album. \"I want people to hear this record and go, 'Wow, there is a whole lot more to these country folks.'\"\n\nAnd in Morgan, those folks have no better messenger.", "otherInfo": "Fridays at Four Live Series"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patricia Vonne Fan Page ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8732530.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Americana, Country Rock, Rock, Border Rock, Latin Alternative", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Patricia Vonne has proven herself a truly ascendant and transcendent musical artist.

With rigorous minimalism and maturity, chief songwriter Shaun Morgan \u2013 long one of rock\u2019s most unheralded melodists, has become a composer of deep emotion and clear-eyed vulnerability. The band too has developed into one of rock\u2019s most fearsome units, playing with precision, grit and authority, yet still light on their feet. After 15+ years of hardscrabble success, it\u2019s evident that Seether felt like survival was not enough. They had something to prove with this new album \u2013 somewhere farther to go.\n\nOne reason for the new approach must surely be Seether\u2019s close partnership with ace producer Brendan O\u2019Brien (Springsteen, Pearl Jam). More like a member of the band than a hired gun, O\u2019Brien repeatedly championed Morgan as one of music\u2019s most gifted songwriters and vocalists and Seether as one of rock\u2019s most extraordinary bands. His unrelenting faith in their talent and potential has been something of a North Star for Seether, helping them struggle through and outlast some very dark times.\n\nRecognizing that he needed to limit distractions, in early 2013 Morgan went about constructing a refuge in his New Hampshire home \u2013 a space where these new songs could develop and take shape. \u201cI actually built a room that I could write in,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI personally pulled out the carpet, put in wood flooring, decorated, and painted. After getting off the road, it was a process of preparation to get the environment just right. I made a place that I felt comfortable and creative in. I was able to be safe and isolated, concentrating on writing music instead of dealing with the distractions that come with daily life.\u201d\n\nLyrically, Morgan has never been afraid to look his demons in the eye. The people in these songs confront the truth with simmering rage; it\u2019s the fuel they need to make them feel alive. \u201cThe whole record is a collection of diary entries,\u201d Morgan revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s just where I\u2019m at and what I\u2019m going through. I\u2019m writing songs about getting through whatever situations I\u2019m in at the time. These songs deal with relationships and life situations.\u201d\n\nMorgan emerged with a collection of fleshed-out ideas that the musicians honed during rehearsals together in drummer John Humphrey\u2019s native Oklahoma. By the time they assembled with O\u2019Brien to record the album at Hollywood\u2019s Henson Studios in January 2014, their vision had clearly come into focus.\n\n\u201cIt felt so natural,\u201d explains Humphrey. \u201cWhen we get together, there\u2019s an indescribable chemistry. That\u2019s all over this album. The three of us can jam together and finish a song pretty quickly. We were really focused. These guys are my second family. We\u2019re tight musically and otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe band cut the entire album in sixteen days. The swift recording pace did not allow them to smother the tracks with overproduction, but rather gave the songs a chance to breathe. On working with O\u2019Brien, bassist Dale Stewart enthused, \u201cHe\u2019s like a fourth band member at this point. We understand each other. He likes to get in there and work quickly and he encourages us to be ourselves. We often followed our first instinct. That allowed us to capture the moment.\u201d\n\nThe album opener, \u201cSee You At The Bottom,\u201d quickly locks in with brutal force as Morgan\u2019s Beatles-meets-Nirvana wail comes screaming out of the speakers. From there, the album never lets up.\n\nGnashing riffs underpin another infectious chorus on the virulent first single, \u201cWords As Weapons.\u201d Morgan\u2019s remarkable ear for indelible melodies is truly the band\u2019s secret weapon. It\u2019s what makes Isolate and Medicate so damn listenable. Morgan makes unrelenting despair a fun listen.\n\n\u201cSame Damn Life\u201d \u2013 a boiling rejection of suburban sprawl juxtaposed against Morgan\u2019s surgery falsetto \u2013 is a pop metal surprise. \u201cI always felt like there was something there,\u201d Morgan said of the song. \u201cIt started from a riff and went into a vocal idea. I\u2019m a big fan of The Beatles. It\u2019s fun to do something with that pop element. Those are the songs that stick with you.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s centerpiece, \u201cCrash,\u201d is quite possibly the most beautiful song Seether has ever recorded. Gorgeous vocal lines and warm, fuzzed-out guitars cascading into pulsating wall-of-sound atmospherics mark an undeniable creative peak for the band. \u201cIt\u2019s different from what we\u2019ve done in the past and that excited all of us,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t follow the stereotypical formula. It\u2019s pretty. It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s emotional and deep.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the band\u2019s fresh outlook is the strong support and enthusiasm they feel from new label partners The Bicycle Music Company/Concord Music Group. The brothers-in-arms feel was galvanized with their new team. \u201cIn one of our first meetings with the label, we played everybody five or six completed songs,\u201d Morgan remembers. \u201cThis marked the first time anybody outside of the band and Brendan listened to it. Afterwards, everybody was really excited and happy. Seeing the level of enthusiasm was great. That felt like the moment everything came together. It was a rebirth, in a sense.\u201d\n\nSeether has worked tirelessly to reach this point. The hard rocking outfit originally from Pretoria, South Africa has now released eight albums in all, two of which have gone Platinum and two more that are certified Gold along with a live concert DVD that has sold over 500,000 units \u2013 for total worldwide sales in excess of 4.5 million. The consistent hit makers have quietly amassed eleven #1 singles and seventeen Top 5 multi-format hits resulting in singles sales that top seven million \u2013 a level of success few artists working today can match. Seether has averaged 120 performances a year, crisscrossing the globe, emerging into headlining mainstays and featured performers on many of the world\u2019s biggest rock festivals.\n\nIsolate and Medicate will undoubtedly resonate deeply with the group\u2019s fiercely loyal fans. \u201cI hope everybody can feel this,\u201d concludes Humphrey. \u201cIt\u2019s a special album for us, and we put everything we had into it.\u201d\n\nMorgan completes the sentiment, \u201cI want them to walk away having enjoyed the music. I want them to get the same emotional sense and happiness we feel listening to it. It\u2019s so important and tied to memories we\u2019ve all had. When somebody listens, it\u2019ll hopefully make them feel good. They will know they\u2019re not alone. That\u2019s the reason we do it.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join Dale as he makes traditional South African Jerky at 5PM CT on 5/29.

Motown mainstays Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.\n\nMcMaster himself says he wants to include two or three more guests before unveiling Icons of Soul to the public later in 2018, a work that will cast an eye to yesterday while focusing on the sounds of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018This is what I love to do,\u201d notes Luke McMaster. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m a constant student, I\u2019m applying these lessons that you can\u2019t learn from a book towards perfecting my own skills as a writer.\n\n\u201cThis is something uniquely special that I want to take to another level for those that love R&B, soul and Motown music -

The original members were Stephan Jenkins (singer, songwriter, electric guitar), Kevin Cadogan (guitar), Adrian Burley (drums), and Jason Slater (bass guitar). The band's original line-up changed several times before the release of the group's debut album, and again shortly after the release of the band's second album Blue \u2014 at which point the band's main guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released from the band under circumstances that still elicit controversy among fans. Third Eye Blind's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, electric guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums), and Tony Fredianelli (electric guitar). More recently, bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the quartet is unclear. Leo Kremer has been filling in for Salazar during concerts, but it is not yet known if he will become a full-time member. For a time the band also featured ex-Smash Mouth drummer Michael Urbano and early Primus drummer Tim ''Curveball'' Wright.\n\nThird Eye Blind recorded their first demo in 1993. In 1996, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis, prior to which performance, so the legend goes, Third Eye Blind was warned that the crowd might throw food at them. As it turned out, however, they were invited out for an encore, even after Oasis had already played, bringing Liam Gallagher to tears and sparking the friendly rivalry that would form between the two bands. The band was paid double what they were promised for the gig. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, in which they settled on Elektra because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom. Stephan Jenkins' outspoken behavior after signing the deal earned him the title of \"the biggest mouth in music\" by many critics. Jenkins has spoken out many times against several different artists, including a heated feud with Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox Twenty.\n\nA fourth album, tentatively titled Ursa Major, is scheduled for a winter 2008 release. Shortly after the band has slated the release of a follow-up album, Ursa Minor. Only Jenkins' lyrics and vocals are left to be finished; all instrumental work is reportedly complete. Recent live performances have revealed a majority of the new tracks being worked on, including \"Don't Believe a Word,\" \"Lay Back (and the Water Will Hold You),\" \"In the Skin,\" \"Summer Town,\" \"Second Born,\" \"(You Really) Don't Like Me Now\" aka \"Campfire,\" \"Monotov's Private Opera,\" \"Break Me,\" \"Stevie Ray Vaughan,\" \"Red Star,\" and \"Standing Up For You.\" Other tracks mentioned for the album by Fredianelli are \"Away,\" \"A Sharp Knife,\" \"Captain of Emo,\" \"Swimming,\" and \"Jesse 2k.\" He also confirmed that \"Lay Back\" was scrapped. A number of previously unreleased recordings were made available, including \"Persephone,\" \"Carnival Barker\" (an instrumental), and numerous instrumental sessions declined by Jenkins for inclusion on the fourth album.", "otherInfo": "Please note the exact film start time is 6:11PM ET."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Silverstein ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10399020.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Alternative, Emo, Post Hardcore, Punk", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "For the past two decades, Silverstein have relentlessly pushed themselves to become the best version of the band for both themselves and their fans.

The band's style has been influenced by conventional indie pop, psychedelic music, vaudeville and music hall on their earlier releases and by afrobeat, funk, krautrock and reggae on their recent releases.\n\nThe band's style has been known to change between albums. At first, the band embraced a more simple, quirky, lo-fi indie pop sound, which occasionally bordered on twee pop. The band was created by Kevin Barnes and named after a failed romance with a woman from Montreal, though the story changes in various interviews. Barnes was the only member of the \"group\" prior to his relocation to Athens, Georgia. There, he met Derek Almstead, later of Circulatory System, M Coast, Elf Power etc., and Bryan Poole, who also performs as The Late B.P. Helium.\n\nTogether, they recorded their first album, Cherry Peel, as well as The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower and The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy.\nA number of singles and a re-release of The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower occurred before the release of the band's third album, The Gay Parade in 1999. With contributions from several members of the Elephant Six collective at the time, it also featured artwork from Kevin's brother David Barnes, who would continue to do artwork for future albums.\n\nThis album marked that the band had moved to a fuller sound, which is also found on its follow-up, Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse. These two albums contain more narrative lyrics, as opposed to the rather personal lyrical matter of those preceding it, and often imitating the style of old 1950s radio plays.\nAfter production on The Gay Parade began in 1998, Poole left the band to focus on his duties with Elf Power, another Elephant Six band from Athens. Barnes also recruited Jamey Huggins and Dottie Alexander, who had been performing together as Lightning Bug vs. Firefly, to play various instruments. Derek moved from drums to bass. The band was joined soon after by Marshmallow Coast's Andy Gonzales.\nFollowing the release of The Gay Parade, the band signed with Kindercore Records, who would release a number of singles and compilations. It wasn't until 2001 that Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse would be released as a new album with original material. The album again featured contributions from across the Elephant 6 spectrum.\n\nIn 2002, Aldhils Arboretum was released, with a slightly different sound than its predecessors, as the songs were more directly structured. This album marks the beginning of the change in of Montreal's sound, with more danceable rhythms than ever before, especially on the album's closer, \"Death Dance Of The Omipapas and Sons For You\". A successful tour ensued, including of Montreal's first trip to the UK, along with a tour-only EP.\nKindercore Records would fold shortly after the release of Arboretum, and of Montreal's status was also threatened. Kevin got married, and Andy and Derek left the band. Barnes, being uncomfortable with the unrest, as well as some divisions within the band, took to writing and performing their 2004 album Satanic Panic in the Attic mostly by himself. Released by Polyvinyl Records, it became one of their more successful efforts to that point. The 2004 tour saw The Late B.P. Helium (Bryan Poole) rejoin the band, with some bass played by Kevin's partner Nina Barnes. The album marked a shift to an The sound shifted to something more electronic with traditional structures, to be further advanced in later albums and new songs. In their most recent releases and concerts, the band has fully embraced a sort of techno-pop glam image, with little of their previous incarnations surfacing. This style is featured in singles such as Disconnect the Dots. The style would continue to evolve into 2005's The Sunlandic Twins, which was even more a Barnes solo effort. Recorded in Athens, with the exception of one track recorded in Norway, it was a much more pronounced electronic album. The album became a success, mostly due to the singles \"So Begins Our Alabee\" and the MTV clip for \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (and Other Games)\".\n\nThe band released several collections of singles in early 2006. Barnes recorded most of the band's 2007 release, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?, by himself while living in Norway and Athens, Georgia. The switch to autobiographical themes of suicide, depression and isolation of the album was a direct product of his troubled personal life during that period.\n\nof Montreal's next album, Skeletal Lamping, is scheduled to be released in October 2008. The album has been leaked to Internet through various torrent sites.\n\nLyrically, their style has changed dramatically throughout the years. In the beginning, many songs were narratives of personal or humorous situations, such as \"Tim, I Wish You Were Born A Girl\", from Cherry Peel. This style, however, changed with The Gay Parade, where many songs involve small narratives surrounding invented characters (in songs such as \"Jacques Lamure\", \"The Autobiographical Grandpa\", \"Mimi Merlot\" and \"Rose Robert\"). Others act as extracts from fictional conversations (\"Advice From a Divorced Gentleman to His Bachelor Friend Considering Marriage\" and \"Good Morning Mr. Edminton\" as examples). With Aldhils Arboretum came a slight return to the previous writing style, except following more poppy, classical lyrical structures (such as the use of choruses, which are generally absent in the Gay Parade/Coquelicot years). This style continued throughout Satanic Panic and The Sunlandic Twins to some extent. On the band's most recent album, Hissing Fauna: Are You The Destroyer?, the lyrics are much more personal than previously used, with songs detailing emotions within the speaker.\n\nAnother unique quality of the band is the fusion of ostensibly gloomy lyrics with bouncy, upbeat melodies and hooks. On Aldhils Arboretum, for example, the lyrics for tracks like \"Doing Nothing\" and \"Old People in the Cemetery\" focus on apathy, loneliness or death while being contrasted with cheerful instrumentation. Another example of this tendency is shown in their choice of covers; for example, Yoko Ono's \"I Felt Like Smashing my Head Through a Clear Glass Window\" from The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower.\n\nTrue to the style of most Elephant 6 recording artists, of Montreal's members have been in a variety of side projects and other bands:\nThe band itself has performed as the backing band for Marshmallow Coast on record and on tour.\n\nMy First Keyboard was the pseudonym used by Dottie Alexander to release the song \"The You I Created\" on the Kindercore singles club. of Montreal acted as her backing band.\n\nKevin Barnes did a comedy tour with his wife, Nina, and his brother, David, called \"A Pollinaire Rave\".\nJamey Huggins released an album under the name James Husband, which featured a cover of The Beatles' \"We Can Work it Out\".\nBryan Poole has a solo career as The Late B.P. Helium.\nKevin Barnes has recently been collaborating with Andrew VanWyngarden from MGMT, on a project called Blikk Fang (formerly Ocelot Fang).\nDerek Almstead has worked with many artists as a musician and engineer including his collaboration with Andy Gonzales - M Coast, Elf Power, Circulatory System, and many more.\nKevin Barnes played keyboard in a song on Bright Eyes' album Letting Off the Happiness.\nThe song \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (And Other Games)\" can be heard on radio and television commercials with words changed for an advertisement for Outback Steakhouse.

Over ten years and seven long players into their career, White Denim are still in the relentless pursuit of a thread- in other words, a wick.\n\nThe band have carefully studied the greatest records ever made, but they write songs just dumb enough to drink, dance, and fight to. Theirs is a music that aims for the whole body, while equally satisfying the mind. While it has morphed, expanded, and even burst apart, White Denim\u2019s sincere and human drive and ability to spark exhilaration have been unerring constants of the band\u2019s existence. Now, two years on from their comeback album supreme 'Stiff,' singer-guitarist Petralli and bassist Steve Terebecki have changed tack again for their seventh full-length, 'Performance.' A new studio, new collaborators, and new techniques for writing and recording influenced the elastic possibility and liberation felt throughout.\n\nIf the album\u2019s title seems meaningful in its deadpan simplicity, it is. There is, of course, the meaning of \u201cperformance\u201d that applies to anyone for whom the live arena is the proving ground. There\u2019s also something more personal but universally acknowledged \u2013 the gap that exists between what we project and who we really are. \u201cThere is something absurd and isolating in continuing this pursuit for personal connection on such a wide scale. When writing an album I essentially leave my actual life, retreat deeper into myself and as it nears completion, I evaluate my work based on my own extremely skewed notion of what is widely relatable and still legitimately cool,\u201d says Petralli. \u201cMy idea of cool is most significantly shaped by Steve\u2019s body language when we are talking through ideas in session.\u201d It has been said that \u201cA clown enriched knows neither relation nor friend.\u201d\n\n'Performance' was mainly recorded over eight weeks at the band\u2019s new downtown Austin studio, Radio Milk. Once an old general store constructed in 1902, it is now respectfully restored and sandwiched in between bars and modern condominiums. Two new players were key in what Petralli describes as \u201ca super-collaborative record:\u201d keyboardist Michael Hunter, a \u201cyoung, humble genius with endless potential\u201d and Conrad Choucroun, a \u201cridiculously solid\u201d drummer with a long stint with NRBQ on his resume. \"If you take nothing else from this at least take some time to listen to NRBQ, rock & roll scholars who shared members with the Sun Ra Arkestra\" advises Petralli. It makes sense that White Denim would develop a kinship with a player from their circle. In many ways, they are a continuation of that sort of group. One that will never stop pushing and taking every opportunity to shine a light on and exemplify what is truly good about Rock & Roll music.\n\nCategorically speaking, White Denim is still impossible to narrowly pin down. There\u2019s the glam-rock strut of \u201cMagazin\u201d and \u201cIt Might Get Dark,\u201d the dueling guitars on the low-slung blues prog of \u201cMoves On\u201d, and the sideways jazz of \u201cSky Beaming.\u201d There are plenty of pleasingly unexpected musical moments on the title track and the easy-rolling closer \u201cGood News,\u201d along with some seriously distorted guitar. In the title track, Petralli sings, \u201cFlashing light in a tunnel, You\u2019re indicating a change.\u201d In many ways, White Denim is the flashing light in a dark and crowded tunnel of showbiz glop.

With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight.\nDoucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson.\n\nTogether with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style.\n\nAlthough Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976.\n\nGrand Texas Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark & Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil).\nDoucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a \"Legends of Folk Violin\" tour.\n\n\nMore to come", "otherInfo": "A weekly show of tunes I play now and used to play long ago.

Whether it was \u201cLet it Be\u201d by The Beatles, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d by Bruce Springsteen (a fellow New Jersey native), or \u201cIt\u2019s My Party\u201d by Leslie Gore she was into it. A 90\u2019s baby herself, Bowman\u2019s knowledge and love for music spans decades. Inspired by pop acts and bands of the 90\u2019s in particular she knew she wanted to pursue music at an early age. After graduating high school, not having a clue how to pursue a career in music, she started going into New York City looking to meet with producers and songwriters who might want to work with her. After several failed auditions, several unreturned phone calls, and a little bit of heartbreak she met a producer who saw something in her. Bowman, only a singer at the time began recording songs written by the producer. Suggesting she start writing herself, with the melody and concept already started Bowman alongside her producer finished writing what would be her first single \u201cProblem.\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d was added to Sirius XM 20 on 20 and in 2 weeks was a top 5 requested song. Her next single \u201cKing Boy\u201d trumped her first becoming the 5th most played song of the year on Sirius XM 20 on 20 while also selling over 20,000 copies, a major feat for an independent artist.\n\nWith the success of her first 2 releases Bowman found herself writing with more and more producers/songwriters. She had been working on new music with a writer at Warner Chappell Publishing when the synch team there received a request for a song about staying warm. Alongside the producer Bowman wrote \u201cKeep Me Warm,\u201d a release that would play in a national McDonald\u2019s ad campaign for over a month, as well as receive airplay on 3 different radio formats: Top 40, Hot AC, and AC.\n\nContinuing to work alongside different writers/producers she caught the attention of Kobalt Music. A publishing company who\u2019s rosters includes the likes of Max Martin, Mumford and Sons, Simon and Garfunkel, Lionel Richie, Dixie Chicks, Beck, and countless other successful artists and songwriters. Eventually signed to a Kobalt publishing deal herself Bowman released \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d through AWAL, Kobalt\u2019s global artist services company. \u201cGood Time Good Life\u201d debuted on NBC\u2019s This Is Us, ran in a national Target ad, a national Beaches Resort ad, and was chosen by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drive The Oscar\u2019s 2017 promo aired on ABC for over 2 months. The Oscar promo lead to Bowman\u2019s national TV debut on Good Morning America where she performed \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d followed up with a performance at the Radio Disney Music Awards, and Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nWith the success of \u201cGood Time Good Life,\u201d and a move out west (a NJ native now in Los Angeles) Bowman found herself working on music going in a slightly different direction. She was doing less co-writes and found herself writing everyday on her own. Songs started pouring out of her. Her life was changing and the music she was writing was some of the realest she had ever written. In March of 2018 Bowman found herself traveling to London to explore a new city and work on new music. A NJ native, now based in Los Angeles, traveling to London. It was on a whim that she decided to attend an open mic night where she\u2019d perform a couple of her new songs for the first time. It was at that open mic night that she would meet the 2 cowriters/producers that would bring this new direction of music, this new project, to life. Bowman traveled back to London for over a month in the summer and in the fall to work on what will be her first ever EP. A lyrically driven, wearing her heart on her sleeve, completely open and honest EP titled Apartment 101 released in 2019.", "otherInfo": "Enjoy an hour of Erin Bowman Instagram Live for a cocktail, conversation & performance."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ NORIE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10397759.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Dance Hall, Soca, Afro Beat, Hip Hop, Reggae", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Unlike his Panamanian namesake, deposed dictator General Manuel Noriega, music is the weaponry of choice for DJ Noriega (better known to his millions of listeners as DJ Norie) although his incomparable mixing skills and irrepressible energy on the microphone transform his musical selections into formidable artillery that is feared by colleagues and competitors alike. Indeed, since he debuted almost two and a half years ago on New York City hip hop station WWPR Power 105.1 FM, Norie\u2019s Sunday night show \u201cAnything Goes-Caribbean Edition\u201d, a vigorous blend of soca, reggaeton, roots reggae and dancehall, accented with a distinctive Brooklyn flavor, consistently tops the ratings for the 8-10 PM time slot according to Arbitron statistics.\nRespectfully referred to as Da Reggae Don, DJ Norie was born to Panamanian parents in Brooklyn, which is often referred to a Jamaica\u2019s 15th parish, due to its concentration of immigrants from reggae\u2019s birthplace. Raised in Brooklyn\u2019s East Flatbush area, Norie became familiar with the music of Shabba Ranks, Super Cat and Ninja Man (dancehall reggae superstars of the late 1980s and early \u201890s) by listening to coveted sound clash cassettes that furthered the popularity of the latest reggae hits and the renown of the era\u2019s premier Jamaican sound systems. \u201cListening to the cassettes of Stone Love, Kilimanjaro and other sounds I thought, I want to be a part of that,\u201d Norie recalled.\nBarely into his teens, Norie began working with a neighborhood sound doing odd jobs such as carrying speakers and other equipment to their various gigs around Brooklyn. He paid close attention to the deejays (or selectors in Jamaican parlance) observing their proficiency in choosing just the right tunes to elicit roaring responses from the crowd and keep them on the dance floor. When the selectors needed to take a break, Norie got the chance to display his burgeoning skills on the wheels of steel; however, these early career-training sessions took place unbeknownst to Norie\u2019s mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will get in trouble for saying this now but my mom used to work nights so I used to sneak out to play at these basement parties, and basically that is how I learned to select,\u201d Norie laughingly discloses. \u201cIt was kind of hard in the beginning; they used to line up four or five records, tell me what to play and when I played them, people used to go crazy. So it used to seem like, yeah, I can do this, even though I was scared as s*#t. But I did it anyway and it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nNorie\u2019s fears subsided with repeated stints at the turntables and eventually he was recruited by Spectrum Disco, working with selectors Redds and Super C; as Spectrum\u2019s popularity spread throughout Brooklyn and the greater New York area during the 1990s, so too did Norie\u2019s renown as an intimidating selector. In the late 1990s Super Claude, the founder of Afrique Sound Station, one of the most venerated sound systems in the New York area, recruited Norie to join the set. Alongside Afrique\u2019s remarkable team of selectors, which included Jagga B, Crazy Richie and Super Twitch, Norie\u2019s talents were taken to a wider audience that spanned many states and several countries. \u201cSometimes you have to make a move, enhance yourself and go for you, and Afrique is where my name really started from, its what took me to the level of traveling with the music,\u201d Norie reflects. \u201cI will never forget Spectrum Disco because that is where I came from but Afrique has been in the business for more than 20 years, they set the trend for \u2018nuff sounds and it is a blessing to have been a part of it.\u201d\nNorie has also played on numerous Brooklyn based pirate and Internet stations that exclusively play reggae and Caribbean music (he even started one of his own, My Radio 94.3 FM), a phenomenon indicative of the vast potential for Caribbean music in the New York area. But Norie\u2019s expertise in selecting dancehall also resonated with a mainstream listenership, as he found out when he joined up with (hip hop) DJ Self as one of six deejays comprising a collective called Da Union, which enabled him to take dancehall into several (Manhattan) clubs where it had previously been excluded. This led to a few guest appearances on Power 105.1 FM, and eventually his Sunday night show on the station, which has contributed to his enviable status as America\u2019s most influential radio personality for dancehall reggae. As such, Norie is usually the first to transform a core dancehall anthem into an international hit, which he recently did with Stephen and Damian Marley\u2019s single \u201cJah Army\u201d, featuring Buju Banton.\nNorie is also the personal deejay for Beenie Man, with whom he travels whenever the artist has a show outside of Jamaica and he has also toured with Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Mavado and Serani. On March 30, 2011 at New York City\u2019s BB King\u2019s nightclub, Norie made history selecting the rhythms for seven time Grammy winner Stephen Marley\u2019s first performance done solely to backing tracks (that is, without his band\u2019s accompaniment); Marley headlined Norie\u2019s two year anniversary party for his Power 105 show, which was also the one year anniversary celebration for his immensely popular monthly live concert series, \u201cAnything Goes\u201d. \u201cStephen was a little hesitant at first, because he never performed to tracks before, but he did it and he was happy about it, so it is a great experience to have under my belt,\u201d Norie shares.\nNorie has recently partnered on several projects with Queens New York based VP Records, the largest independent reggae label in the world. He selects the music at each of VP\u2019s album release parties and the label\u2019s artists are regularly showcased at his \u201cAnything Goes\u201d series. For VP Records\u2019 \u201cReggae Gold 2011\u201d, a collection of the year\u2019s biggest reggae hits, Da Reggae Don provided a vibrant, 35-minute bonus mix CD, rife with artists\u2019 shout-outs to Norie (including 2011 Celebrity Apprentice winner/country superstar John Rich) and customized renditions of popular songs. Additionally, Norie has just started recording artists on his own dancehall rhythms and he plans to release those tracks as part of his own compilation series sometime in the near future.\nEach of Norie\u2019s endeavors is in pursuit of his ultimate goal: expanding the overall popularity of Caribbean music, especially dancehall reggae, the music that inspired his career path almost 20 years ago. \u201cMy radio show has served a lot of purposes; not only did it allow my fans to get to know me but it allowed me to give back to this music game,\u201d Norie explains. \u201cBut I would like to get further in radio, be more than just a deejay because then I can help reggae by impressing upon program directors that New York\u2019s Caribbean population is really an untapped market that no one is paying attention to so why not go out and support it? We don\u2019t have to follow the same trends that everyone has been doing for years and years, we can do things differently, add on and make it much stronger.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "james petralli ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Solo covers set"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Mr. V ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10337247.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Electronic, House Music, Edm", "Time": "10:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Experiencing Mr. V\u2019s DJ sets, original productions, or remixes is like taking a trip back in time to dance music\u2019s golden age.

In the fall of \u201999 she moved to Salzgitter, Germany where she collaborated on a commercial pop project, marking her first experience singing in a professional studio. In May 2000 she returned to Austin to explore performing and song writing. Following her role as supporting vocalist and dancer for the Austin high-energy rock band Young Heart Attack in 2001, Martin launched her solo career in 2002 with an opening slot for Wilco and her debut album Pretty Things. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, she moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia and had her first commercial success when two of her songs were placed in the award-winning British-Canadian two-part drama Sex Traffic (2004) and in the TV drama series Snakes and Ladders (2004).\n\nWith her second album, Two Hearts (2008), Martin gained considerable attention as a hot up-and-coming artist with several East Coast Music Awards and Nominations. Her Two Hearts music video rose to #5 on the Much More Music Countdown, leading to tours across Canada, the US and Ireland. She performed high-profile shows with Canadian rock icon Matt Mays and sang on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for The Queen of England. You Come Home was placed in the internationally distributed teen drama series The Best Years (2010). Two Hearts won Martin two 2008 Music Nova Scotia Awards, and a 2009 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year.\n\nHer third album I Can Too (2010) received rave reviews and includes a collaboration with Blue Rodeo\u2019s Greg Keelor on her rendering of Andrew Sisk\u2019s Subject To Change. \u201cWhat sets I Can Too apart is Martin\u2019s commitment to honestly exploring complicated relationships.\u201d (Exclaim Magazine, October 2010). Following multiple East Coast Music Award Nominations and extensive touring across Canada with Juno nominated indie rock band Cuff The Duke, Martin began touring independently in Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nIn 2011 Martin worked on building her label Come Undone Records, and focused on developing a global online presence with fans via community-based projects. She worked with PledgeMusic.com to release A House Concert (2011) containing fourteen live acoustic versions of songs from her first three studio albums. Martin was nominated at the 2011 Music Nova Scotia Awards for Digital Artist of the Year and A House Concert was nominated at the 2012 East Coast Music Awards for Folk Recording of the Year. This project also raised awareness and funds for the Canadian Mental Health Association. During 2011-2012 Christina continued her community development initiatives with a yearlong Artist in Residency through Geriatric Medicine Research (GMR) at Dalhousie University and The Canadian Dementia Knowledge Translation Network (CDKTN) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2014 she released an EP titled Remember Me, featuring five songs inspired by and dedicated to individuals affected by dementia. Co-produced and written by Dale Murray, the EP won the 2014 Music Nova Scotia Award for Inspirational Recording of the Year.\n\nSleeping With A Stranger (2012), Martin\u02bcs fifth award-winning album, reflects the artist\u2019s coming of age lyrically and musically. \u201cIt\u02bcs one of those rare albums where you have to listen to it all in one sitting. Like a good book that\u2019s hard to put down, Sleeping With A Stranger tickles the ears and within three bars you\u2019re completely hooked.\u201d (Americana UK, October 2012). The album won her the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Female Recording of the Year Award. It was nominated for three East Coast Music Awards Come Undone Records was nominated for Music Nova Scotia Company of the Year. What I Always Knew was placed in the CBC television drama Heartland and her single Falling For You remained on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 countdown for five months.\n\nMartin returned home from Europe in the spring of 2014, following eighty concert dates which included a performance at Rolling Stone Weekender Festival, a publicity partnership with PopUp Records in Hamburg, and an endorsement from the esteemed Duesenberg Custom Guitar Shop in Hannover, Germany. She secured relationships for her future from her home base as Artist in Residence in the city of Dachau, Germany.\n\nIt\u2019ll Be Alright (2015) found Christina attaining what her music has always suggested, a place where the ghosts of her musical heroes freely mingle with the architecture of modern music. Working closely with her long-time producer and guitarist Dale Murray, drummer Brian Murray and bassist Jason Vautour, Martin made a conscious effort to confound the expectations of those who have categorized her in the past. This record utilizes far more sonic textures, allowing Martin to explore the many sides of her musical personality. The album won a 2016 ECMA for Pop Recording of the Year and her It\u2019ll Be Alright single rose to #6 on the CBC Radio2 Top 20 chart. You Ran From Me was voted the #14 most played Canadian song on Sonica for 2015, and Somewhere With You was placed in the CBC Television show Heartland.\n\nFollowing two years of touring across Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, The UK, Switzerland, Austria, France and Canada, Martin returned home briefly in 2016 to write her newest album. A fervent anthem for those who are lost and longing, Lungs Are Burning was the first single from her album Impossible To Hold (Released March 23, 2018). The first single was triggered by the rising Fentanyl drug crisis killing thousands of Canadians, with Christina\u2019s lyrics set to music by her and Dale Murray. With lyrics like \u201cwhile I\u2019m watching the babies\u201d and \u201cgot to go out and get some, baby\u201d, Martin captures the desperation of \u201cchasing the dream\u201d and the horror of living it. Murray\u2019s stately production brings that stark reality home with a bite. Martin: \u201cThe song is an modest attempt to bring light to the heavy topic of addiction, and reflects my own personal sense of loss, longing and a deep void, and the ache I feel from losing my brother and friends to addiction and mental illness.\u201d For her Canadian tour dates, Christina has partnered with Center for Addiction and Mental Health to increase engagement and awareness.\n\n\u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is Martin\u2019s sixth and strongest studio album, achieving a perfect balance between organic ambience and impeccable production. \u201cI\u2019m writing about faith and love more than ever with songs like \u2018Keep Me Calm\u2019 and \u2018Always Reminding\u2019, but I haven\u2019t shaken the need to write about the darker things that are part of our human journey\u201d. Combining good taste, passionate singing and thoughtful lyrics, \u201cImpossible To Hold\u201d is where music and poetry meet.

Coming up near Chicago in the early 90s, Intel grew up in the early days of Hip Hop with a fascination for turntablism. He quickly hit the decks with a set of turntables and a mixer he \u201cborrowed\u201d from his brother, and started off on the path that Chicago DJ legends like PNS and Tone B Nimble paved. Between the house parties and the B-boy battles, Intel quickly made a name for himself across the Midwest.\n\nIntel still holds down the decks for the B-boys, but his scope and style--fueled by his limitless passion and innovation--have evolved. The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft.\n\nWNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him.

However, within three months of moving to the big city, Theresa\u2019s father and best friend passed away.\n\n\u201cIt was a very confusing time for me,\u201d recalls Theresa. \u201cI was very insecure. I had all these dreams, but they seemed so far out of reach.\u201d\n\nTheresa re-focused her music career to work behind the scenes, taking intern roles at Jive Records and with Sheryl Crow\u2019s management company, W Management. Later, she landed in the advertising world as a music producer for commercials. But, last year, Theresa decided to once again chase her girlhood dreams, and reignited her career as an artist.\n\nNow living in Queens, Theresa has come a long way since \u2018Love is Like Bubblegum.\u201d Her 2019 debut single, \u201cThings About to Change\u201d reached over 40 thousand streams in its first month on Spotify. Then, in November of 2019, she released her highly acclaimed follow-up single, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Another Day.\n\nTaking cues from the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, Theresa draws influence from artists like Blondie, Madonna, Duran Duran, Mariah Carey and Lady Gaga.\n\n\u201cI wanted to BE Madonna when I was younger,\u201d admits Theresa. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t about her sex appeal.

But it was time to shove fear in the closet and throw away the key. I needed to \u201cLet Go\u201d to move the fuck forward!\u201d\n\nAs Theresa moved forward, she continues to generate well-deserved buzz for her infectious brand of pop.

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

The young Dallas native began to see a lifetime of hard work pay off in spades in 2015, as he signed with Sunfire Entertainment, released a critically acclaimed debut album, cracked the top 25 on the Texas Music Chart, and shared bills with Hayes Carll, Randy Rogers, Turnpike Troubadours, Green River Ordinance, and more. \"This is all I wanted to do since I was 14,\" he reflects, \"and now I'm doing it.\"\n\nWith so much momentum on his side, it's no surprise that Cartwright titled his new release 'Don't Fade.' It's a note-to-self that he more than lives up to on the EP, bringing together the heartfelt vulnerability of Ryan Adams and the arena-ready anthems of Eric Church into an infectious, genre-blurring masterpiece. The tracks showcase Cartwright's considerable growth, both as a writer and performer, while honing in on the sharp lyrics and soulful delivery that earned his self-titled debut widespread praise in Texas and beyond. The Dallas Observer called that record \"one of the very best of 2015,\" while the Fort Worth Star Telegram raved that \"there\u2019s an ease and a polish\u2026belying Cartwright\u2019s relative youth,\" and Red Dirt Nation said that it \"stirs what makes us all feel young and poignantly reminds us how fragile we all are when it comes to love, heartbreak and home.\" For Cartwright, though, it was only just the prelude.\n\n\"You never know what you don't know,\" he reflects from his newly adopted hometown of Nashville. \"I'm very proud of that first record and some of those songs have done very well for me, but with a whole additional year-and-a-half of hard touring and writing under my belt when we recorded 'Don't Fade,' I felt like I had a much better idea of how I wanted to sound and who I was as an artist.\"\n\nCartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited primarily to the 'Forrest Gump' soundtrack and Steven Curtis Chapman records. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar, and suddenly the entire world opened up. He discovered singer-songwriters and alt-country troubadours, contemporaries like Pete Yorn and classic artists like John Prine. It led him to begin penning his own songs, and by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches. A summer program at NYU exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\nCartwright worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs, and while they paid the bills, they left him unsatisfied and more convinced than ever that he needed to take the leap with his own music. He moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, 'Bull Run,' that earned him top honors in the B.W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition. A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on the self-titled debut that would break him onto the Texas radio charts.\n\nThroughout it all, Cartwright was a hustler to his core, playing 100+ shows per year without an agent or a manager, working harder than he ever had before in his life but moving closer towards his goals every day. The quality of the music and the exhilarating live performances were turning heads throughout the south, and that's when Cartwright caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to produce 'Don't Fade' with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillips\u2019 Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio.\n\n\"We spent three or four days in total at Rob's house before we went into the studio because I had between 30-50 songs that I had written,\" remembers Cartwright. \"Rob and I went through each of them and pared the list down to figure out what made for a cohesive collection and what kind of sound we wanted to go after.\"\n\nThe sound that they ultimately landed on is instantly appealing, a warm, radio-friendly blend that calls to mind everything from Will Hoge to The Old 97's. Earworm opener \"Never Coming Back\" is an ideal showcase for Cartwright's gifts, with his silky-smooth vocals riding a laid-back drum groove punctuated by dynamic electric guitar riffs and classic rock organ swells.\n\n\"That was one of the first co-writes I ever did in Nashville,\" says Cartwright. \"I wrote it with Ty Graham, who had actually been my next door neighbor at Berklee during my freshman year. We always used to talk about girls and relationships in college, and when we sat down to write this song, the story was something we'd both experienced in our personal lives, so it came together really naturally.\"\n\nCartwright takes a darker turn on \"Busted,\" a driving, gritty tune inspired by the breakdown of a truck in the west Texas heat that mirrored the breakdown of his own crumbling relationship, while \"Nobody But You\" channels the pain of staying behind while a loved one leaves, and the sweetly emotional \"Don't Fade\" battles the inevitable passage of time. One of the most special moments for Cartwright, though, comes at the end of the EP, as the stripped-down acoustic meditation of \"Arkansas\" drifts off into an ethereal soundscape like the last rays of light at sunset.\n\n\"That ending was a very specific idea that came to me on a camping trip with my roommate,\" remembers Cartwright. \"We were spending the days and nights out in the middle of nowhere just listening to the crickets chirp and trying to figure out life, and I wanted to recreate that feeling.\"\n\nThe ability to capture such intimate, meaningful moments is the magic of Cartwright's songwriting. These are tunes about coming and going, uncertainty and change, finding yourself and what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams. There are no dramatic revelations here, just the steadily deepening understanding of self that comes with maturing. Cartwright renders the sound of growing up beautifully and in vivid detail, capturing the anxiety and the ecstasy in all its messy, human glory. For a kid who grew up worshipping songwriters, to craft such exceptional music is to truly live the dream, and with another full length album on the way, it's safe to say Troy Cartwright's years are going to just keep getting bigger and bigger.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anthony DeVito ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10265031.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "One Man Show, Standup Comedy, Improvisation, Comedy, Stand Up Comedy, Stand Up, Sketch Comedy", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Anthony DeVito is a NYC based comedian who recently made his network television debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Rogue Wave is headed by Zach Schwartz (aka Zach Rogue), who created the band after losing his job in the dot-com bust. Their first album was Out of the Shadow which was written, recorded and produced entirely by Zach Rogue (except the drums) - released privately in 2003 and finally re-released in 2004 on Subpop. In the autumn of 2004 they went on a national tour of the US, which lasted two years. They have been compared in the music press to The Shins. Their second album, Descended Like Vultures, was released in October of 2005.\n\nThey are also featured on the Stubbs: The Zombie Soundtrack doing a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Everyday\". A live version of their Out of the Shadow track, \"Every Moment\", appeared on the soundtrack for the movie Napoleon Dynamite. However, the song never appeared in the movie itself. In addition, the song \"Eyes\" was featured twice in the Ryan Reynolds movie Just Friends this fall, and the first episode of NBC's Heroes. The Fox show The O.C. has used Rogue Wave songs, \"Publish My Love\" (DLV) and \"Interruptions\" (10:1 EP) as well as included \"Publish My Love\" on The O.C. Mix 5, a collection of songs used in the show. Rogue Wave recently recorded an exclusive song for the new movie, \"Spiderman 3\".\n\nUntil very recently, the band lineup consisted of Zach Rogue (Vocals, Guitar), Pat Spurgeon (Drums, Samples, Guitar, Vocals), Gram LeBron (Keyboards, Guitar, Drums, Vocals) and Evan Farrell (Bass, Vocals). Farrell replaced original bassist Sonya Westcott in Autumn of 2004. Unfortunately, in December 2007, bassist Farrell passed away in a house fire. A link to the memorial paypal fund set up to help support the Farrell family can be found on the band's website www.roguewavemusic.com. Their new bassist is Patrick Abernethy.\n\nZach Rogue was previously a guitarist in the Bay Area band The Desoto Reds. Pat Spurgeon has played with bands Antenna, Stranded at the Drive In, Ramona The Pest, Brando, Steve Kowalski, and has also released solo work as The Phantom Drummer. Gram LeBron has been involved in the bands: Schrasj, Sad Like Crazy, Conundrum, Jessica Six, All Transistor and has also released solo work as Golden Gram. Evan Farrell has played with the following bands: Japonize Elephants, Mega Mousse, Amaldecor, Big Mule, Hunted Haunted Bazergahn Klezmorchestra, Grande Rouge, Kentucky Nightmare, and Mama HooHoo. Sonya Westcott was in the band Venus Bleeding prior to her time with Rogue Wave and is currently working on an album with her new project.\n\nMost recently, Rogue Wave released Asleep At Heaven's Gate in September of 2007. They are currently wrapping up their US winter tour to start their European tour.

The critically acclaimed five-piece was down to just four members, and while the obvious solution may have been to simply replace their departed comrade, the group instead made the bold choice to completely reimagine their lineup and their catalog, carrying forward as a quartet with an ambitious new approach to writing and recording. The result was a genuine sonic rebirth, a wild musical awakening that brought Parsonsfield closer together than ever before and yielded their most exhilarating and adventurous record yet: Happy Hour On The Floor.\n\u201cRecording this album marked our first time working in the studio as a four-piece, and it was really liberating,\u201d says lead vocalist Chris Freeman. \u201cOnce the lineup changed, we realized that there weren\u2019t any restrictions on what we could do. It came with this boundless sense of musical freedom where anything felt possible.\u201d\nProduced by Benjamin Lazar Davis (Joan As Police Woman, Okkervil River), Happy Hour On The Floor fuses Parsonsfield\u2019s rustic instrumentation and timeless sense of songcraft with dreamy synthesizers and vintage drum machines. The arrangements here are broad and spacious, often built off spare, hypnotizing loops that fuel the songs\u2019 mesmerizing drive, and the band\u2019s performances are deliberate and economical to match, substituting lean, careful construction in place of the strummed exuberance that defined much of their early work. The result is a record all about finding happiness in simplicity, a captivating collection more reminiscent of modern indie pop than old-school string bands that pushes the group far beyond the perceived boundaries of its sound even as it shines a spotlight on the heart and soul of what\u2019s always made them such a joyous revelation.\nHailed by Folk Alley as \"the most jubilant and danceable indie roots music this side of the Carolinas,\" Parsonsfield\u2014Freeman, mandolinist Antonio Alcorn, guitarist Max Shakun, and drummer Erik Hischmann\u2014first emerged in 2014 with Poor Old Shine, an ecstatic acoustic collection that prompted The New York Times to praise them as \"boisterously youthful yet deftly sentimental\u201d and No Depression to rave that they'll \"give you rich five-part harmonies one minute [and] sound like bluegrass on steroids the next.\" The band grew more experimental on their 2016 follow-up, Blooming Through The Black, and the collection earned them both glowing reviews and dates with everyone from Josh Ritter and The Jayhawks to Mandolin Orange and The New Pornographers. That same year, the group saw their music featured in the hit AMC series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and teamed up with the prestigious FreshGrass Festival to compose a score for the 1922 silent classic Nanook of the North, which they performed live alongside the film at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Sophie B.

Not just because she was only one of about seven Black kids in her junior high school, but because of the compelling power of her shockingly big voice, which stopped people in their tracks from early on. Danielia\u2019s natural gift--raw, searing vocal chops combined with a deep, buttery tone--draws from the two different rich traditions that she absorbed early in her youth. On the one hand, she couldn\u2019t get enough of what her friends and neighbors were listening to: AC/DC, Zeppelin, the Stones. On the other, she was her mother\u2019s girl: daughter of a jazz singer and member of the church gospel choir, grooving to Mavis Staples, Etta James, Billie and Ella.\n\nThe happy collision of these two traditions is her new album, Rare Child, produced by Brad Jones (Jill Sobule, Over the Rhine) and co-produced by Joe Blaney (Shawn Colvin, Soul Asylum) and Danielia herself. On Rare Child, the sheer joy and pain she evokes in her songs instantly draw the listener in. She pulls, stretches and grips her lyrics with a strength that is startling considering this lovely young woman\u2019s seemingly happy-go-lucky demeanor and petite frame. Appearances aside, like male counterparts Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone or crossover icon Tina Turner, Danielia not only has embraced the notion of Black Rock--she has redefined it.\n\nVery early on, music played a major role in Danielia\u2019s life. It became not only the focus of what would become her career, but also, her saving grace and her best friend. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have music saving me every day, I wouldn\u2019t have a place to put a lot of emotions that I have that could potentially be destructive,\u201d says Danielia. \u201cIt\u2019s how I survive.\u201d Citing her mother, Danielia speaks lovingly about musical influences that aren\u2019t quite from the playbook of most Rock performers. \u201cI loved Phyllis Hyman\u2019s ..Somewhere In My Lifetime,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand Chaka Khan. But not just the popular stuff. It was her version of ..I Loves You, Porgy\u2019 from Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess. My mom also listened to things like Bonnie Raitt and Loggins & Messina. But for me, it was listening to Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder\u2019s album Songs In The Key of Life: it was about that tone that I thought was the best. And Nancy Wilson singing ..Guess Who I Saw Today\u2019\u2019; the first time I heard that I was like, ..I don\u2019t even like that genre\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get over the delivery. There was so much emotion. I like artists that were living and feeling whatever it was they were singing about.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, more than any other important influence was Danielia\u2019s fascination with musical movies of the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. \u201cI had a thing for Bing Crosby,\u201d she bashfully admits. \u201cI was an old soul. What entertained me didn\u2019t entertain most kids. But we had a deep life. So anything that would take me out of that life was important. Anything that was singing and had a story to it I liked.\u201d A very young Danielia would stand up on a wood crate in her backyard, grab a stick, and sing Donna Summer\u2019s ..Last Dance\u2019 to the trees and a few semi-curious deer, When she realized she could really belt it out, she decided she might make singing her career. Soon, 12 year-old Danielia joined her mom and aunts in a gospel group called Brookes Ensemble Plus, where she learned harmony. Around that time, Danielia received her first guitar. While her mother couldn\u2019t afford to pay for lessons, she gave Danielia a ..How To\u2019 book that the young writer devoured, locking herself in her room until she came out a comfortable player and had penned her first song.\n\nDanielia\u2019s home life wasn\u2019t always easy. Danielia never met her father, a native of Puerto Rico. Moving around a lot and experiencing the hardships of racism, Danielia had to grow up fast. And although Danielia came from very humble beginnings, the one thing the family was not lacking was love and determination to succeed. Raising four kids on her own without a college degree, Danielia\u2019s mother nevertheless became the head of accounting for Houghton-Mifflin Publishing and was determined to make sure her children had the best education possible. To that end, books were in no short supply at home (spoils of the trade), and the children learned to read at an early age, while calculators were treated as toys. Following her mother\u2019s example, Danielia strove to make the most of her opportunities, and in her junior year of high school, she gained entry to the Mercer County School of Performing Arts. Danielia excelled and graduated at the top of her class, going on to obtain a full scholarship to the esteemed Bennington College in Vermont, from which she graduated with a degree in Theater Arts.\nBennington was a major turning point for Danielia. There, she studied with the great avant garde jazz trumpeter Bill Dixon. Noted for his vocalic playing style, Dixon, who founded the Black Music division at Bennington, gave Danielia the guidance she needed to refine her distinctive power as a singer. By her junior and senior year, she was studying tutorials. \u201cHe trained my ear. I\u2019d go to his class every day, and he\u2019d hit a note on his trumpet and ask me to match it. I thought it was the most God-awful thing. But I realize today that my pitch is the way it is because of this training. He taught me basic music theory, keyboard harmony and what music reading and writing was. During my senior year, he sent me to study singing with the classical department so I could learn breath, which is where I found my power. He would die to know I was singing rock \u2018n roll now instead of jazz, but he changed my whole perception of how you sing a song.\u201d\n\nUsing classic songs like Eden Ahbez\u2019s \u201cNature Boy\u201d and reading the lyrics as a soliloquy, Danielia learned that \u201cin any good song, there\u2019s a story; it\u2019s a moment. And it\u2019s the same when you get onstage with those same set of words and discover how you can convey that story to an audience. It helped me realize why I loved singing. It was about the story, the tone\u2014it wasn\u2019t about all the ..tricks.\u2019 It was about singing the line straight. That took more skill.\u201d She credits Dixon with teaching her how to \u201csing ..ugly\u2019.\u201d She explains, \u201cYou have to be able to sing the wrong notes if you ever want to sing beautifully. You have to be able to be ..ugly\u2019 sometimes. That\u2019s where you find your true beauty.\u201d\n\nQuietly writing her own songs under wraps while she studied, she performed several original compositions at a recital after she spent her final year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Drawing raves for her performance as well as her songs, she had learned well by then that her lyrics had to be pulled from her own life experiences in order to be authentic and received in such a positive light. \u201cI have to write from what I know about. It\u2019s like in acting. I can\u2019t play a character who\u2019s 70 at the age of 30. I don\u2019t know what 70 is. I could go to my grandmother and ask her and she might say, ..It\u2019s a loss of faith, it\u2019s tired\u2019 or whatever, but I don\u2019t know this because I haven\u2019t been there. I could only play a role and be true to something I felt. Because then it\u2019s true.\u201d\nAs a performer, Danielia is glad she grew up pre-American Idol. \u201cMost kids today, if you ask why they want to perform, they\u2019ll say they ..want to be a star\u2019 or ..be in the music business.\u2019 I liked music not because I saw it as a way to get out of the life I lived and have more than what I had, which wasn\u2019t that much. I did it because it was fun; it was like a drug. I\u2019ve always felt a little selfish when people say, ..I do it for the people.\u2019 I do it because it does something for me.\u201d\n\nRadio stations across the country appreciated Danielia\u2019s unique rock talent. After Danielia released her first studio album, 2005\u2019s Small White Town (Hipshake Records), WXPN/Philadelphia and home of the nationally syndicated World Caf\u00e9 named her \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d in 2005, slotted the album\u2019s soulful single, \u201cIt\u2019s Only Life\u201d into heavy rotation, and featured her on their HDNetwork broadcast of \u201cOn Stage at World Caf\u00e9 Live\u201d. WXRT in Chicago featured Danielia on New Year\u2019s Eve, where she brought down the house in a live performance broadcast by ABC.\n\nExtensive national touring followed. Danielia traveled the breadth of the country, opening for some of the greatest acts in music, from Blues legends Buddy Guy and Etta James to Pop Rock giant Bon Jovi, to the Southern Rock royalty of Gregg Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Little Feat. Crossing boundaries was no problem for the versatile Danielia, who has wowed alternative rock audiences of the Flaming Lips, Staind and Collective Soul, among many others.\n\nDanielia\u2019s unique talent drew rave reviews, with notices on her \u201craw intensity\u201d (Essence magazine), her \u201csoulful voice and searing telecaster\u201d (Time Out NY) and for possessing \u201cthe sort of voice for which the phrase ..force of nature\u2019 was coined\u201d (Austin American-Statesman). Relix magazine named Danielia one of the \u201c5 Artists You Should Know\u201d in 2007 and New York\u2019s Amsterdam News proclaimed Danielia \u201ca powerful musician that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nThose high accolades often come from those who\u2019ve been blown away by Danielia\u2019s live act. Audiences that experience Danielia and her band live are hit hard with the sheer emotionalism of her songs, and Danielia\u2019s performance style is all about revisiting the feelings that brought those songs into being in the first place. \u201cI give you everything. I\u2019m going back, and these stories are obviously from my life. I\u2019ve picked moments that I can safely go back to time and time again without getting to a place where I can\u2019t collect myself. But, in my songs, I\u2019ll go to places that are still an issue for me. Like in the song ..Rare Child,\u2019 I say, ..On the day I was born/I hope my daddy cried.\u2019 Because I\u2019m still dealing with those issues. So you have to be careful. There\u2019s a responsibility to your audience too, because some of your fans will go there with you. And they don\u2019t know how to pull back either; they\u2019re riding on what you\u2019ve given them. You\u2019re handing them a drug too.\u201d Going back to the idea of music as an emotional release, for the artist and the audience in equal measure, Danielia not only accepts the responsibility, but rather, she is flattered and thrilled by it and sees it as an opportunity. \u201cWhen you hear some of the stories that people tell you and how the songs have helped them through tough times, that\u2019s as good as somebody telling you your album went platinum,\u201d Danielia says. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be about, and then you think, ..This might not be why I wrote this song, but this is what this person got out of it,\u2019 and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nA stiff self-critic, Danielia admits to pre-show and pre-recording bouts of nervousness. \u201cEric Clapton always says, ..If I\u2019m not nervous, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u2019 But then that\u2019s where you get all that energy and you end up giving it back to the audience. And it means just as much to me in the studio when I record. At no time do I take it lightly. I want it to come out well. So it\u2019s harder than live, but I like to record with the band in the studio and I can pull from that energy.\u201d\n\nBut, as much as Danielia is a performer, she is also a proud and dedicated songwriter.\nInspiration for songwriting for Danielia comes at all hours, and her mindset is to grab the moment no matter when it comes and write it down. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up from dreams with an idea, and it was my grandfather that used to say ..God woke you up, and wants you to go get a pen and piece of paper and write it down.\u2019 Otherwise, the idea you had goes away. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get the call, you gotta pick the phone up,\u201d she says. As for when this inspiration hits, contrary to popular belief, it isn\u2019t always as a result of sadness or depression in Danielia\u2019s case. \u201cIt does tend to happen on a cloudy, rainy day, and I do agree with artists that it does happen at moody moments, or when you first wake up, when you\u2019re feeling not necessarily at the peak of happiness. But you can\u2019t always be the source for everything. I collaborate a lot. Like on ..Make U Move\u2019 I collaborated with Kareem Devlin and Shelby Gaines, who I worked with on a lot of the songs on this record. The beauty of co-writing is that when you collaborate, your co-writers take you to a place you normally wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d For example, on \u2018Make U Move,\u2019 one of the most infectious, rocking tracks on Rare Child, \u201cKareem and Shelby brought the track, and I wrote the melody and the words, and there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve come up with that myself.\u201d\nDanielia is very candid about why she would rather wear her heart on her sleeve in her songwriting than try to deliver her music through a manufactured persona. \u201cSome people create characters to make it easier for them to perform, but that\u2019s just not me. I feel that when someone pays to come see me, they\u2019re coming to see me, and so I owe them that. And that\u2019s more interesting to me. Rock \u2018n roll is real, and that\u2019s what people want.\u201d Danielia describes Rare Child as \u201ca party, in a sense. It starts out saying ..I\u2019m gonna rock your world\u2019 but then it arcs, has some soulful moments, and has some upbeat moments. Like going to a really good party, it isn\u2019t all non-stop ..woo-hoo.\u2019 You might get into a deep conversation with someone in one corner and share a joke with someone else in another. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d\nIn making Rare Child Danielia\u2019s goal was to create an album that she could really play. \u201cI think this is an album that the audience wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd because we didn\u2019t try to write singles or do anything like that, it came out being a real rock \u2018n roll album, and that\u2019s exactly the way you have to go about it. And when you\u2019re lucky, it ends up being this great effort, which I think it is.\u201d\nThe meaning behind the album title is at once personal and universal for Danielia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, I don\u2019t see too many Black girls slinging guitars. And I know they\u2019re out there\u2014Tracy Chapman, Toshi Reagon\u2014but in the venues I\u2019m doing and the genre I\u2019m doing, a lot of times it\u2019s just me. Music is so manufactured nowadays. I feel I go back more to the classics, and Rare Child just reminds me of more of the 70\u2019s feel, and I think this album is a throwback to a time when music was less produced and a little bit more honest, accessible and realer. It doesn\u2019t make it better or worse than anything that\u2019s out there now, it just makes it what it is. Which is a little rare for right now. But a lot of people want that.\u201d The Philadelphia Daily News concurs, saying \u201c\u201cDanielia\u2019s music has the swagger of Let It Bleed-era Rolling Stones, her singing has the raw emotional power of Janis Joplin and her songwriting places her among the top new musical storytellers.\u201d\n\nNow releasing Rare Child on Adrenaline Records/ADA, Danielia has put her remarkable voice, heart, and soul into a record that truly rocks.

Suddenly, for him, music became something that was markedly possible, even a potential career path. The musician\u2019s parents enrolled him in a nearby music camp during the summers in Toronto and Francesco began learning to play piano, then guitar. The first song he wrote was called \u201cJaguars,\u201d and it all spiraled from there. \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped writing since,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic was a passion for me that happened all at once. I just wanted to do it all the time. Something clicked in my head and that was it.\u201d\n\nFrancesco signed with Chris Smith Management - 21 Music by the time he was 14 and inked a deal with Atlantic Records at 16. The musician has been working on his debut album, exploring various possibilities for his sound. Working with producers like Robin Hannibal (Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B) and Pharrell in various studios around Los Angeles, the singer has hit upon a deft combination of pop, R&B and soul, bolstered by emotionally poignant lyrics and a strikingly passionate vocal delivery. \u201cFrancesco is a perfectionist, as you can hear on records and that takes time,\u201d says Robin Hannibal. \u201cThere\u2019s no correction, it\u2019s all live and off the floor. It\u2019s done the traditional, real singing way, where you have to get the perfect take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a journey,\u201d the musician says. \u201cIt takes a long time to figure out what feels right for your first album but once it clicks it goes very fast. We had such fun times in the studio, especially because I was with other people who were feeling the same energy that I was feeling. We started in a much different place than where we ended up and I\u2019m really happy with what we created.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u201cCall,\u201d a swoony pop ballad, recalls the evocative crooning of artists like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. It\u2019s a song about having patience for someone you love, an idea that compels Francesco. \u201cYou may not be ready to totally accept love, but that song symbolizes someone being there at all times,\u201d he explains. Swaggering, propulsive number \u201cChange The Channel,\u201d a falsetto-driven funk collaboration with Pharrell, was imagined through a conversation the two musicians had about Led Zeppelin. \u201cPharrell prides himself on being different so we just wanted to be different,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cThat song is just 100 percent itself.\u201d The singer\u2019s more introspective side is explored on \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home,\u201d a crooner that took a few tries to land on. \u201cWe had to do it over and over again,\u201d Francesco says. \u201cIt was funny \u2013 the way we got it was on the very last take. I was giving up and a sudden jolt of energy just came through me and we just kept whatever was there. It feels right.\u201d\n\nFrancesco\u2019s skillful playing can be heard throughout the album as well as his remarkable vocals. The musician, who also recently played guitar on \u201cGust of Wind (featuring Daft Punk),\u201d a track off Pharrell\u2019s recent G I R L album, now balances guitar, piano, bass, drums and even harmonica. His love for various styles of music, from Prince to Queen to Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen, resonates through the music, but mostly it\u2019s Francesco\u2019s positive sensibility that is conveyed the strongest. \u201cFor me, music should be about something that\u2019s positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vibe. You need to feel good when you hear it and when you play it. I want people to feel good when they listen to every one of my songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to accomplish as much as I can with this debut album,\u201d Francesco adds. \u201cI want it to be the biggest thing of my generation. It may sound far-fetched and crazy, but that is the end goal. Whatever steps I can take to get there, I\u2019ll take them. We live in a world of complication, and I just want to bring people out of that and get them to have a good time. If I can do that, then I will feel I will have done my part.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Holy Rollers Rock ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10369413.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk, Folk Rock, Americana, Altcountry, Alternative", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Folk-Rock from Boston - we're on a mission to play music that catches your ear and makes you tap your toes.", "otherInfo": "FRIDAY NIGHT!\n@johnnyfi is going to do a live set and has some EXCITING NEWS TO SHARE on Facebook AND Instagram!!\n.\nOur virtual \u201ctip jar\u201d will be up to raise money for the record we will be working on this summer (Venmo: @holyrollersrock) and a portion of all proceeds collected will be donated to the @macovid19relief fund!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Buffy Sainte-Marie ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6304611.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Academy Award winner Buffy Sainte-Marie\u2019s audacious attitude to life on and off the stage has inspired people around the world for over five decades.", "otherInfo": "Buffy Sainte-Marie reads \u201cHey Little Rockabye - A Lullaby for Pet Adoption\" on Facebook Live, as part of the National Arts Centre's #CanadaPerforms series.\n\nTune in at 7pm ET over at www.Facebook.com/BuffySainteMarie\n\n\"Hey Little Rockabye\" is available in stores now, and for order online: https://bit.ly/2znpgw4\n\nSing-a-long to the book:\nhttps://smarturl.it/heylittlerockabye"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Josh David ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8609666.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Country, Country Blues", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Josh David has performed across North America.

And, since arriving in Nashville from Florida at seventeen, he's also always been about guiding his career equally from the gut and the heart. Since his top-streaming song \"Woulda Left Me Too\" introduced him as a singer with an unusually empathetic hand (and garnered millions of plays on Spotify), Griffin has been working to release music that finds his unique niche between R&B and country, and between fun and true vulnerability. And now, with three new busbee-produced tracks and more on the horizon, Griffin has never been more ready for this moment.\n\n\"I've never felt more true to myself than I have with this music,\" says Griffin. \"These songs have never felt so right.\" Indeed, \"Best Cold Beer,\" \"Good Company\" and \"Play It By Heart\" are pure Griffin: they're fun, as soulful and groovy as they are twangy, and uniquely perceptive, packed with razor-sharp insights about living and loving.\nThe child of hardworking parents who always instilled a deep work ethic in their son, Griffin spend his youth out in the sod fields and, in his down time, wrestling for any say in the car radio stations with his two brothers and his mom \u2013 to little success. But in hindsight, it was for the best: he ended up listening to everything from Vince Gill and George Strait to modern pop and R&B once he hit high school, and it shaped him in ways he didn't even realize at the time.\n\nOne evening his father \u2013 who also loved Jimmy Buffett \u2013 took him to a local country festival, and Griffin's future suddenly became clear: \"I got to see Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson and all of these dudes,\" Griffin remembers. \"That's when I realized this is what I want to do.\"\n\nA little boy who would hum melodies almost before he could talk, Griffin was always a musical kid, but his father, who raised two more sports-focused sons before him, didn't know quite what to do with him. So, one day, he pulled out the phone book.\n\n\"He said 'I'm going to call everyone who has something to do with music and find out what to do with this kid',\" Griffin remembers. \"He sat there for hours and there was finally this dude who answered the phone, and he had a studio in his garage which was kind of unheard of. My pops said, 'alright we'll be there this week.'\"\n\nGriffin went in and recorded a little demo, and that was it. He spent the rest of his teenage years opening for the likes of Neil McCoy and Highway 101, and playing any\nstage he could. Then, at seventeen, he finally followed his dreams to Nashville, enrolling at Belmont University, first in the voice program and then, afraid all the training would massage the character form his sound, in the Music Business program. And, like most promising graduates, he hit all the milestones: he won the country music showcase, played the Best of the Best, and scored an internship at Broken Bow that saw him hitting the road to help tour manage Jason Aldean.\n\nBut it still didn't all come easy after that: bouncing through a label and a publishing deal, Griffin sometimes wondered if this creative life was becoming too much of a hardship for his young family \u2013 but it was his wife who told him to stay the path and keep pursuing his dreams. So in 2017, he released his EP, Sake of the Summer, with \"Woulda Left Me Too\" now topping five million streams \u2013 and \"Dibs\" going to number one.\n\nFor this next sampling of songs (\"Best Cold Beer,\" \"Good Company\" and \"Play It By Heart\") Griffin just wanted to focus on making it relatable. \"I wanted to write songs that people could really latch on to,\" he says. \"To meet people where they are and provide an escape, while being truly authentic to me.\"\n\nAnd for Griffin, that means providing both plaintive moments and pure fun. Produced by busbee, these three songs are indeed both: a little bit Keith Urban and a little bit Brian McKnight, \"'Good Company' is a departure and it's an escape,\" says Griffin. \"You can't not dance and forget about all the B.S. But I'm not afraid of a vulnerable song that cuts to the heart, and 'Play It By Heart' is about how I live my life and how my wife and I walk through our marriage.\" And \"Best Cold Beer\" is a surprising lyrical twist about the lure of romance \u2013 and a good turn on the dance floor.\n\nHaving already opened for the likes of Ballerini, Lady Antebellum and Old Dominion, Griffin will take these songs on the road this summer at select festival dates while he hones his record. One of Rolling Stone\u2019s 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know he's also been highlighted on 2018 Ones to Watch lists by AOL, AXS, Country Fancast, NY Country Swag, PopDust and Thought Catalog \u2013 and all as a result of keeping his eye on his ultimate goal, no matter the circumstances.\n\n\"I always knew in my heart if I kept fighting, if I kept pushing and kept grinding,\" he says, \"I'd get there. This is my calling.\"", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Miss Jennifer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7170653.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Fri May 29 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-29", "Genre": "Deep House, Tech House, Techno", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "One of New York\u2019s finest, Jennifer has been rocking dance floors in NY nightclubs since 2009.

A little bit folk, a little bit country/Americana and with a whole lot of soul, Pettis has released two DIY albums and the Dallas Morning News has hailed her as \"one of the most talented young singer-songwriters in America\".\n\nPettis first came to the attention of MPress founder and President Rachael Sage at a SXSW party in Austin, where her voice and presence, even totally unplugged in a crowded room, commanded the spotlight. Sage gushes, \"Grace Pettis is one of the best singers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. And when I say 'best', I don't mean that in a showy way -\u2013 although her voice is both powerful and beautiful. I mean that she can tell a story with her voice in a way that cuts right to the heart of our collective humanity, whatever the topic may be. Her songwriting is nothing short of masterful, and to see these timeless qualities in someone so young feels like discovering something akin to the magic of Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash or perhaps, Brandi Carlile. MPress Records is thrilled to be working with Grace!\"\n\nPettis, who is repped by Chas Management, will be touring the southeastern US and Europe in winter/spring 2020. Her first release on MPress is expected later on in the year. In the meantime, she is eager to have found such a supportive new team. \"Signing a record deal sounds pretty daunting\", Pettis admits. \"It's not a decision to take lightly. But from the first conversation with Rachael Sage and her wonderful team, I've felt like I've finally found my way home. After a decade of releasing my own music, I couldn't be more thrilled to announce that I'm partnering with MPress Records, a label that has built its unique reputation on championing and supporting artists and putting music with integrity out into the world. I'm so proud to be a part of the MPress family.\"\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the south Austin scene, Grace Pettis has amassed bragging rights to spare. She is the winner of many of the nation\u2019s most prestigious songwriting contests, including NPR's Mountain Stage NewSong Contest, and has received grants from the Buddy Holly Educational Foundation. Grace\u2019s songs have been recorded by other esteemed artists, including Sara Hickman and Ruthie Foster and she added to her songwriting accomplishments in 2019 by signing a publishing deal with BMG.

According to an article by Stephen Thanabalan in Rolling Stone Magazine, Paul's style has also been most notably influential in the late 1990s thru mid 2000s with his prescience vis a vis his unique music and sound: featuring a combination of dextrously deep and smooth vocals as well as raw guitar 'roots' stylistics; emulated most evidently in the industry in ensuing years with the mainstream emergence of melancholic rock and folk pop solo artistes like Rascal Flatts, James Blunt, Damien Rice and Jack Johnson.", "otherInfo": "ELLIS PAUL\u2019S TRAVELING MEDICINE SHOW Returns this Friday May 29th at 7:30pm EST on Facebook Live at Ellis Paul Music and More!

The band performed on the Warped Tour and other high profile gigs before dissolving. But heavy metal was never Jordan\u2019s passion; it was just a fun experience with his friends to grow musically. As a child, Jordan grew up with R&B artists like Sam Cooke and Earth Wind & Fire providing the soundtrack to his frequent road trips to a ski resort with his family. Artists from what his father called \u201cthe good music era.\u201d Those were the sounds and stylings that stuck in Jordan\u2019s musical memory and by the time he was old enough to realize that his own singing voice was a gift, it was those early groove-funk-soul singers that had shaped his personal aesthetic. If he was going to make records, those were the kind of influences he wanted to draw from.\n\nAfter his move from California to Nashville, Jordan was invited to participate in an unsigned artists retreat hosted by Centricity Music. It was the combination of Jordan\u2019s nuanced vocal abilities, the freshness of his retro-influenced melodies and songwriting, and his warm, enthusiastic personality that spurred label execs to take a closer look and ultimately sign him.\n\nJordan Feliz\u2019s debut project, Beloved, brings the rich influence of 70\u2019s sensibilities into a modern pop context. Intentionally constructing uncluttered tracks free of production tricks and excessive instrumentation, Jordan instead focused on arrangements that were designed to give the vocals center stage. The songs on the Beloved 10 song album are soul-influenced pop numbers, and the instruments present are articulate in their voicings and melodies, saying only as much as they need to.\n\n\u201cI was the kid growing up with the headphones on listening to every lick and reading the lyrics,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cMy dad had a collection of cassettes. My mom had some vinyl. I discovered artists like the Commodores, Bill Withers, and Nat King Cole through them. When I was in the studio making Beloved, I told my producers I didn\u2019t want thirty guitars stacked on one track. I didn\u2019t want five different guitar tones. I want to put one guitar sound on a song and find a way to make that one lick sound massive, the way those 70\u2019s artists were able to do. If you stack too many sounds on one track you can lose the song in all that clutter. Building \u2018clean\u2019 tracks on Beloved was very intentional.\u201d\n\nTag-team produced by Colby Wedgeworth (Lincoln Brewster, The Main, Lydia) and Josh Silverberg (Newsboys, Jon Foreman, Plumb), Beloved has plenty of radio-friendly pop melodies that manages to hit those marks without compromising Jordan\u2019s unique musical personality. The best example of his singular vision is the record\u2019s powerhouse first single, \u201cThe River.\u201d While it sounds like a pulse-quickening mega-hit from the first listen\u2014instantly singable and repeatedly listenable\u2014 the song actually rides on a deep current of soul-driven funk influence that serves to set it apart from other contemporary radio fare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big melody guy,\u201d Jordan admits, \u201cand musically \u2018The River\u2019 is my own personal happy place. It\u2019s a great driving groove that just feels good to sing. The song itself is an invitation to anyone who hears it\u2014whether they\u2019re stuck in pride and legalism or wallowing down in the mess they\u2019ve made of their lives\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to take whatever we have and to run to Jesus. It\u2019s an invitation to go down in amazing grace and to rise up being made new.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s title track, while every bit as soulful and catchy as the first single, was penned from a more personal and autobiographical posture. Jordan\u2019s wife was about to give birth to their first child, and Jordan began to consider what he, as a new father, would most want to communicate to the daughter he was about to meet.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018Beloved\u2019 before she was born,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wrote it with two guys who both had little girls. The thing I really wanted my daughter to grow up knowing was that no matter what the world tells her, she\u2019s beloved. She\u2019s loved beyond compare. Regardless of what any of the people around her think, she doesn\u2019t have to be concerned with measuring up because I\u2019m gonna love her unconditionally as long as she lives. She\u2019s beloved and that\u2019s a love she was born into without having to earn it. I wrote it for her, but of course the parallel of God\u2019s unconditional love for His children is obvious. Anything I feel for my daughter is just a small echo of what God feels for her and for all of us.\u201d\n\nWith its slow build and towering vocal hooks, \u201cBeloved\u201d will doubtless provide one of the cornerstones of Jordan\u2019s energetic live shows, along with \u201cThe River,\u201d a festive cut that reveals some of the artist\u2019s roots as a worship leader, and the laid back grooving track, \u201cSimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my record has a theme, it\u2019s probably summed up in the \u2018Simple lyric,\u2019\u201d Jordan explains. \u201cI really just wanted this to be a project that people would smile when they listened to it. I wanted to write songs that would make people feel loved. I want them to feel good. Whatever the complications of life that we might be going through at any given moment, our relationships with Jesus don\u2019t have to be difficult. We have a tendency to make it so much harder on ourselves than it really is. We think God can\u2019t love us because we\u2019re struggling with something or we messed up somewhere. But it\u2019s not that complicated. God loves us. Our ransom has been paid. The emotional baggage we carry around doesn\u2019t change the truth. We belong to God and He loves us. It really is that simple. We just have to be constantly reminded of that. The work has already been done on the cross. We just have to remind ourselves and each other to believe it.\u201d\n\nHaving just navigated a long and rocky transition after leaving the security of his local music connections, a church staff position, and moving from California to Tennessee, Jordan Feliz and his wife experienced firsthand what it means to learn to rest in the simplicity of faith in a Father who daily provides for the needs of His children. In fact, they set out from California without even enough money to make it past Phoenix. But along each leg of the journey some music gig opened up that provided enough funds to drive the next leg. By the time they reached their new home, Jordan had actually made several hundred dollars from the move.\n\n\u201cWe believed God had made it clear from the beginning we should move to Nashville,\u201d Jordan says, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. After we got here I couldn\u2019t find a job. My wife and I were sharing one car. I was posting handyman ads on Craigslist and working as a valet downtown. I could hardly get any people to write songs with me. Then we found out we were pregnant and there was so much that seemed up in the air and kind of scary. In the last few months though, it\u2019s just been like this whirlwind of good things falling into place. I signed the record deal with Centricity Music in February of this year and I finished the Beloved record July 5th. Then, I actually won a brand new car, completely out of the blue, right before my daughter was born July 20th. My first single went to radio July 31st. After so much difficulty and uncertainty, God answered our prayers. He is there for all of us and all we have to do is remain faithful.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Join an exclusive VIP video call with Jordan Feliz and experience a rare opportunity to ask questions and hear directly from one of your favorite artists!

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s . The recording won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nThere were also Grammy awards for the already mentioned Juntos Para Siempre (Calle 54, 2007), the duet recording with Bebo; and for Chucho\u2019s Steps (Comanche, 2010), featuring his new group, the Afro-Cuban Messengers .\n\nIn total, Chucho has won five Grammys and three Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2012, Chucho reorganized his Afro-Cuban Messengers which currently feature Yaroldy Abreu, percussion, Dreiser Durruthy Bombal\u00e9 , bat\u00e1 drums and voice; Reinaldo Meli\u00e1n, trumpet, Gast\u00f3n Joya, bass and Rodney Barreto, drums.\n\nHis most recent production, Border-Free, is yet another expression of the continuing musical search and evolution of Chucho Vald\u00e9s as a pianist, composer, arranger and director.", "otherInfo": "On Friday, May 29 at 5PM PT, SFJAZZ presents a live stream of Chucho Vald\u00e9s' February 2019 concert.

Added to that thick and intriguing sound are a series of dark and ironic lyrics, combining the mood and tone of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds with the narrative force of The Decemberists or a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Adam Turla fills out these sometimes frightening, sometimes beautiful lyrics by conjuring up a cast of character voices, allowing the songs to speak with the force of the characters themselves, and providing the listener with a sense of ensemble unique in rock music.\n\nBut this ensemble feel is not only the result of Turla's vocal playfulness, but of the cohesive playing of the band itself. Sarah Balliet channels her Kentucky bluegrass roots through the skilled hands of a concert cellist, playing point and counterpoint to the lyrics and guitars with magnificent grace and style. [bandmember from=2000]Matt Armstrong's bass guitar provides the rhythmic framework of the band, but also takes the lead with surprising frequency, guiding Murder by Death into driving highs and brooding lows. And Alex Schrodt's drumsticks almost dance across the skins, giving the band what the Chicago Reader called \"a rhythm section Nick Cave or The Faint would die for.\" The result is a fascinating slice of American Gothic, replete with trail rides, whiskey shots and Old Scratch himself.\n\nMurder By Death were discovered in 2000 by Thursday vocalist, Geoff Rickly, when the two bands played on the same bill at a gig in their hometown of Bloomington, Indiana. Rickly introduced the band, known at the time as Little Joe Gould, to his friend Alex Saavedra (owner of Eyeball Records), who signed the group immediately. Rickly performs discreet background vocals in the song Killbot 2000. The Little Joe Gould EP was issued in 2001, the group later deciding on changing the name to Murder By Death, which they felt better represented the \"Americana noir and dramatic post-punk\" of their sound.\n\nMurder by Death's unique sound has developed over several years of touring and recording. Constantly evolving their sound, the style changes from their first release Like The Exorcist, But More Breakdancing to their sophomore release, Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?. \"Who Will Survive...\" grew from a small, limited pressing album into a sleeper hit as they constantly toured the country, sharing the stage with bands as diverse as The Weakerthans, Rasputina, Lucero, Against Me!, and William Elliott Whitmore. \"Who Will Survive...\"'s rich narrative structure, which recounted the travails of a small western town besieged by the devil, not only garnered popular and critical attention, but inspired a number of artistic reactions and responses, including ballet and stage productions, paintings, and even a PhD thesis.\n\nThe band's third album, entitled \"In Bocca al Lupo\", forgoes the integrated narrative structure of \"Who will Survive..., \" presenting the listener with an album built on thematic connections. \"In Bocca al Lupo,\" which translates roughly to \"In the Mouth of the Wolf\" (a phrase said before students take exams in Italian classrooms, and to which the students respond \"Kill the Wolf\"), examines themes of sin, transgression, punishment, and redemption, touching on different lives and different stories in each individual song. The resulting album resembles the 1979 murder mystery from which the band takes its name-a pastiche of bad deeds and good intentions, of last minute heroism and, in some cases, nearly impossible forgiveness.\n\nMusically, \"In Bocca al Lupo\" is as diverse as the various stories that the album recounts. The songs themselves reflect the stories they tell-gritty rock and roll beats drive \"Brother\" and \"Sometimes the Line Walks You,\" complex tango rhythms twine themselves through \"One More Notch,\" and lonely western guitars accompany the simple elegance of \"Shiola\" and \"Raw Deal.\" Each of the album's ballads and waltzes, chants and hard hitting rock songs, meld content and form, creating meaning in the music itself. Murder by Death's unique musical aesthetic ties these seemingly disparate tracks together. With the help of producer J. Robbins (Jets to Brazil, Jawbox, Against Me!) the lush melodies and harmonies so unique to the band transform these varied sounds into a coherent and cohesive album, an album whose overall sound and sensibility melds the darkest moments of Modest Mouse's \"Good News for People Who Love Bad News\" with the maudlin country roots of Western folk-rock. The band's thick, fretted, knotty sound provides a through line, tying together an album as musically diverse as the backcountry roads and basement rooms that inspired it.\n\n\"In Bocca al Lupo,\" on Tent Show Records, the band's own label, shows off Murder by Death's maturity, both as songwriters and musicians. The album is alternately rough and gentle, elegant and complex, intelligent and playful; it moves from one to the other without breaking stride, without interrupting the album as whole. Murder by Death is known for their talent as performers, for their live presence, the ambiance and energy present in their music. \"In Bocca al Lupo\" harnesses this energy and distills it, adding to it the maturity of a band constantly on the road.\n\nRed Of Tooth And Claw\n\nMurder By Death's fourth album, and first with Vagrant Records was released in March 2008, entitled Red Of Tooth And Claw. Produced by Trina Shoemaker at Dark Horse Studios in Tennessee, the record features former keyboardist Vincent Edwards on the song \"Ball & Chain\" and is also the first album to feature new drummer Dagan Thogerson, who replaced founding member Alex Schrodt. It continues with the band's trademark themes: \"lust, betrayal, and classical archetypes of good and evil.\" In Turla's words, the record is an \"Homer\u2019s Odyssey of revenge, only without the honorable character at the center.\" The vocals are again sung in the same low, baritone range as In Bocca Al Lupo causing many critics to speculate that Red Of Tooth And Claw breaks less new ground than previous efforts, although in general the album has been well received. As described by allmusic.com the album \"carries over some of the Old West outlaw feel of its predecessor, but it's more aggressive and freewheeling here. [...] [The album] isn't a departure for Murder By Death, but their ability to keep their sound fresh and vibrant speaks well of their musical abilities.\" To celebrate the album's release, Murder By Death played two shows on the same night in their hometown of Bloomington.\n\nMembers\nAdam Turla - vocals, guitars\nSarah Balliet - cello, keys\nDagan Thogerson - percussion\nMatt Armstrong - bass\n\nPrevious members\nVincent Edwards - keys (left the band in 2004 to pursue an art degree)\nBrandon Cooper - keys mid-2004\nAlex Schrodt - percussion through mid-2007", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "JAMIE KENT ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7262244.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Folk, Country & Southern Rock, Americana, Country And Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Named by RollingStone.com as an \"Artist You Need To Know\", and dubbed a \"rising country star\" by Fox & Friends, one might say the future of Jamie Kent looks quite promising.

Sex. Doomed Romance. These three simple phrases define the sound and thematic presence of Panic Priest. The musical project of singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Jack Armondo (of \u201cdark pop\u201d outfit My Gold Mask), Panic Priest is centered around Armondo\u02bcs deep, crooning vocals while weaving together dreamy guitars and synths.\nPanic Priest\u02bcs long awaited sophomore effort \u201cSecond Seduction\u201d is a significant sonic expansion on the project\u02bcs signature sound (which was first unveiled by way of the debut self-titled offering in 2018). Co-Produced and engineered by Brian Fox (Wingtips, Ganser), the new album intertwines classic genres such as Darkwave, Post-Punk and Goth while a richly layered modern Synth-pop sensibility elevates the album to something larger than simple nostalgic recreation. Performed and composed almost entirely by Armondo (with key contributions by Twin Tribes, Vincent Segretario of Wingtips and Gretta Rochelle of My Gold Mask), \u201cSecond Seduction\u201d is simultaneously personal yet fantastical. A cathartic account of Armondo\u02bcs real life experiences, stemming from personal heartbreak, life as a non-monogamous individual and even current political anxieties, be prepared to once again be tempted and lured into the world of Panic Priest.\n\n\nCABLES AND LACE\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CablesandLace\n\nThe Portal Opens at 7pm, PANIC PRIEST at 7:30 / AL1CE at 8:15 / CABLES AND LACE at 9:00 and Tea Time at 10pm.

Hannah always knew she wanted to be an entertainer, but it wasn't until she was ten years old that she made her debut solo performance at her fourth grade Christmas Recital. She sang \"Tender Tennessee Christmas\". After that she was hooked. She focused on nothing else. At fourteen she picked up a Squire acoustic guitar that her younger sister had abandoned and quickly began learning to write. Over the next four years she performed at fairs, coffee houses, shopping malls and talent shows throughout the Upper Midwest. At eighteen Hannah moved to Nashville, TN to make her dreams a reality. She attended Belmont University in Nashville to study the business of music and vocal performance. After two years she decided to leave Belmont and delve deeper into the art of song writing. She also began performing her own material in and around Nashville. In 2010 Hannah released her first EP, a self produced project called, \"No Stopping, Standing, Parking\". It received rave reviews from the Nashville songwriting community. Soon after it's release, she was personally selected to attend the prestigious Horse & Writer Songwriting Invitational by one of Nashville's most successful songwriters, Skip Ewing. Hannah was a contestant on the 2011 season of the reality television show, \"The X Factor USA\". Her goal was to show America her unique version of country music. The results were evident when her fan base exploded and has continued to grow ever since. Hannah returned to Nashville to continue performing and writing. Her hard work paid off when she secured four song cuts on the debut album of country artist, Rachele Lynae, on Momentum Label Group. Hannah's newest project, \"The Freedom EP\", was released on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Her current single from the project, \"No Where Left to Roam\" has been sent to Country, Americana, College and Internet radio around the world and is receiving an enthusiastic response. \"The Freedom EP\" includes five original tracks and is available now on all major online stores including iTunes and Amazon, as well as her website.

Three of Metaphor\u2019s nine songs are Eastern European traditionals, but could easily be mistaken for the band\u2019s original tunes, so singular has their sound become.

As he learned about Mozart, Bach and others, he began to realize that contemporary music is very simply the music of the pepople. The overtures and opuses of the 1700s were the popular songs of that era. People identified with those songs in the same way that today's \u201chits\u201d appeal to the masses of this generation. As a songwriter, specifically for liturgy in 2017, the question that provokes him is: How do I create a song that will honor traditions and music yet speak to the modern Church and lead them to worship?\n\nJosh collaborated with his guitar player, Grae McCullough, to write a new mass setting, paying homage to the hymns of the past and the culture of modern worship. \u201cEvery week we lead music for school and parish masses, so we knew we needed something that would resonate with all ages. We also wanted it to be joyful, approachable and easy to sing but still fresh, dynamic and expressive,\u201d says Blakesley.\n\nOn March 3, 2017 is the release of this long-awaited project called Mass of Restoration. It is available now anywhere music can be downloaded. For sheet music, please visit ocp.org\n\nJosh Blakesley's last full-length album, Even in This, was recorded in 2015 in Franklin, TN with Grammy Nominated producer/singer- songwriter, Michael Farren. The album features songs co-written with Farren, Mia Fieldes (Hillsong), Dove Award winner Marc Byrd (God of Wonders) and Grammy Award Nominated, Sarah Hart (Better than a Hallelujah).\n\nThe title track from the album is a song about finding hope in the darkest valleys of life. It was born out of tragedy after the band's guitar player, Grae McCullough, lost his one-month-old daughter to a chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18. \"The peace I had the day Lizzie's short life ended could have only been God. There was an underlying sense of peace in the devastation and the song really encapsulates the situation we were in,\" says McCoullough.\n\nBlakesley has been featured on Sirius XM, EWTN\u2019s Life on the Rock, Relevant Radio, KLOVE and has performed with wide variety of Christian artists like Matt Maher, Andrew Peterson, Jars of Clay and the Newsboys; as well as several International Papal events, most recently in Milan, Italy in 2012. He continues to tour heavily with dates booked all over the US and Canada in 2017. He partners with Compassion International as a spokesperson for releasing children from poverty in Jesus\u2019 name.

This style is referred to generally as trance-fusion. Formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania, the group has quickly emerged as one of the most successful independent bands in the country.\n\nThe Disco Biscuits are also well-known for their ability to run long sets together, sometimes even playing their songs backwards, in styles referred to as \"inverted\" and \"dyslexic.\" An inverted version of a song occurs when the band starts a song by playing its ending segment, followed immediately by its beginning segment and a jam that segues out of that song and into another. A dyslexic song is played the same way as an inverted one, with its main difference being that the pieces of the song are not played consecutively (e.g. ending of 1 -> 2, 3, 4, beginning of 1 -> 5). Another technique employed by the band is a fakeout, which occurs when the band plays a jam that usually leads into one song, but segues into another unexpectedly.\n\nDue to the separation of their segments, dyslexic songs can begin on one night's show and end the next night. The nature of their setlists is both a blessing and a curse; while the myriad variations on their songs are interesting to hardcore fans of the band, it can confuse people who are not already familiar with their catalog. This forces the listener to be immediately willing to immerse themselves in the Disco Biscuits' large catalog, which can prove to be a rather overwhelming task for novices to undertake. On the other hand, many are fascinated by the game of \"what song are they going to play next\", and are disappointed when their ears are attuned enough to know the answers in advance.\n\nThe band has 2 rock operas as part of their catalog: the Hot Air Balloon (written by guitarist Jon Gutwillig) and the Chemical Warfare Brigade (written by bassist Marc Brownstein).\n\nOn 11/5/04 The Disco Biscuits announced that drummer Sam Altman was leaving the band to attend medical school. The band had toured only sporadically from the end of the summer of 2003 until Sammy's official departure was confirmed. The band announced that Allen Aucoin would replace Altman as the full-time drummer on 12/12/05, ending months of speculation.\n\nIn 2007, the band co-headlined the D.U.M.B.

Would you like to get together sometime and play them?\" to try to get a date with violinist Josie Quick. Josie saw through to his true intention, but she also saw that he was sincere about his music. Well, Tom went home and set to work arranging his music with a violin in mind. A rehearsal date was set, and one of the first songs they did was to become the title song on their first CD, Ready, Willing, and Able.\n\nTom had been in a number of rock bands, and they had always met an early demise. He was ready to try a different tactic for getting a band going. This time he was going to create a core of two people that could work together, and build from there.\n\nJosie had been wanting to get more into playing jazz violin. The spontaneity of improvisation was intriguing to her. Problem was, there wasn't a lot of opportunity for getting together with other jazz musicians. Her violin was always drowned out by the other instruments, and electric violins and violin pickups hadn't yet come into use.\n\nThe time was right for these two to get together. Tom's use of open tunings and fingerstyle guitar gave Josie the inspiration to improvise contrapuntal melodies. At first their music was a combination of folk and classical, which can be heard on their first CD.\n\nAs time went on ttheir sound evolved to encompass any musical inspiration that came their way. Determined to break the mold of typical acoustic guitar and violin music, they dive into the blues, rock and roll, jazz, and anything else they can think of.

Co-Produced and engineered by Brian Fox (Wingtips, Ganser), the new album intertwines classic genres such as Darkwave, Post-Punk and Goth while a richly layered modern Synth-pop sensibility elevates the album to something larger than simple nostalgic recreation. Performed and composed almost entirely by Armondo (with key contributions by Twin Tribes, Vincent Segretario of Wingtips and Gretta Rochelle of My Gold Mask), \u201cSecond Seduction\u201d is simultaneously personal yet fantastical.

On this recording, Valdes is again featured with his Afro-Cuban Messengers, and the compositions include nods to flamenco, the Gnawa music of Morocco and the ritual rhythms of the Orishas, the deities of the Afro-Cuban Santer\u00eda religion. There are mentions of hard-bop and danz\u00f3n but also echoes of Bach, Rachmaninoff and Miles Davis -- and yet the sum total is a deeply personal and open-ended sound. And it\u2019s all Chucho Vald\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cSince I was a student I had this idea of taking disparate elements, mixing them and seeing what happened. And little by little, over time, I\u2019ve found my ways,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cAnd I love it because it\u2019s a search that forces you to investigate and study. It\u2019s not all about Afro-Cuban music. I\u2019m always looking for new things.\u201d\n\nThe concept in Border-Free \u201cwas to do many different things but all in my own style. Now, that is something very difficult to achieve.\u201d\n\nDionisio Jes\u00fas \"Chucho\" Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, was born in a family of musicians in Quivic\u00e1n, Havana province, Cuba, October 9, 1941. His first teachers were his father, the pianist, composer and bandleader Ram\u00f3n \u201cBebo\u201d Vald\u00e9s, and his mother Pilar Rodr\u00edguez, who sang and played the piano.\n\nAt the age of three, Chucho already played at the piano, using both hands, in any key, melodies he heard on the radio. In fact, there is a famous anecdote that tells the story of Bebo tricking his friend, the late Israel \u201cCachao\u201d Lopez, about checking out, with his back to the player, \u201ca young North American pianist.\u201d Chucho was then four years old.\n\nAt the age of five, Chucho began to take lessons on piano, theory and solfege with maestro Oscar Mu\u00f1oz Boufartique. He continued his studies at the Conservatorio Municipal de M\u00fasica de la Habana, from which he graduated at 14. Chucho also took private lessons from Zenaida Romeu, Rosario Franco, Federico Smith and Leo Brouwer.\n\n\u201cAt home he played jazz: the music of Ellington, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller\u2019s band. I\u2019ve been privileged. Because Bebo was the piano player at the Tropicana I could see true legend of jazz in person. He took me to see Nat King Cole, Errol Garner and Sarah Vaughan when I was child studying music. You can\u2019t imagine the effect that had on my life! It was enormous! Magical!\nAt 15 Chucho formed his first jazz trio end in December 1958 he worked as a pianist at the Deauville and St. John hotels in Havana. In 1959, he debuted with the orchestra Sabor de Cuba, directed by his father, Bebo. That band accompanied the top singers of that era such as Rolando Laserie, Fernando \u00c1lvarez and P\u00edo Leyva.\n\n\u201cMy father taught me everything about Cuban music, South American music, jazz, and how to work with an orchestra,\u201d reminisces Chucho. \u201c He gave me the piano chair, and stayed on as director, so I could learn how to work under a conductor. We did our shows and a million other things with that orchestra, including accompanying shows at the Havana Hilton. I learned a lot there. He is my idol, \u201che pauses, then continues. \u201cI don\u00b4t say was, my idol. He is my idol. He was my teacher. He still is.\u201d\n\nChucho\u2019s family and professional life took a dramatic turn in 1960 when his father left to work in Mexico and from there he moved to Europe, where he eventually settled. Bebo Vald\u00e9s never returned to Cuba. (Father and son saw each other again 18 years later at Carnegie Hall, where Chucho was debuting in the United States with his group Irakere. The relationship was fully restored in 2000, when they met again to play a duet on Calle 54, a film about Latin jazz by Oscar winning Spanish director Fernando Trueba. The father and son reunion culminated, musically, in Juntos Para Siempre, a 2007 duet recording that won both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy. Bebo Vald\u00e9s died on March 22, 2013. He was 94.)\n\nIn the early \u201860s, Chucho worked as a pianist at the Teatro Mart\u00ed (1961), the Sal\u00f3n Internacional del Hotel Habana Riviera (1963) and the orchestra of the Teatro Musical de la Habana (1964-67). In 1967, and after a suggestion of his old teacher, the great guitarist, composer and director Leo Brouwer, Chucho organized his own combo.\n\nStill, that same year he joins the important Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, then directed by maestros Armando Romeu and Rafael Somavilla. While a member of the orchestra, Chucho revisited the idea of a small group and, in 1970, he appeared at the Jazz Jamboree in Poland leading his own quintet.\n\nIn 1972, after recording Jazz Bat\u00e1, an album featuring an unusual jazz trio comprising bassist Carlos del Puerto and singer and percussionist Oscar Vald\u00e9s on bat\u00e1 (the traditional hourglass shaped drums used in the ritual music of the Orishas), Chucho decided to enlarge the group adding brass and trap drums. That\u00b4s the genesis, in 1973, of Irakere, a small, Cuban-style big band that played an explosive mix of jazz, rock, classical music and traditional Cuban music, including Afro-Cuban religious music and instruments.\n\n\u201cThe ideas for the brass have to do with the work we did with the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, which was a great big band,\u201d says Chucho. \u201cI tried to imitate that with four horns -- two trumpets, a alto and a tenor sax -- and with just that try to have the sound of a big band. Of course when you have monster players like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, [trumpeter] Jorge Varona and [saxophonist] Carlos Averhoff you can write anything you want and it will work.\u201d\nIrakere first made its mark internationally in Finland in 1976. But the following year, the band was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie in a visit to Havana on a jazz cruise that also included pianist Earl \u201cFatha\u201d Hines and saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1978 the producer Bruce Lundvall, then president of CBS, signed the band for the label. Irakere debuted, unannounced, as \u201csurprise guests,\u201d at Carnegie Hall as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. As fate would have it, the program that night also featured pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner, two of Chucho\u2019s main influences.\n\nSelections from Irakere\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival comprised the repertory of Irakere (CBS) their debut recording in the United States. The album won a Grammy as Best Latin Recording in 1979.\n\nThe group went on to create an extraordinary body of work that includes great dance recordings such as Homenaje a Beny Mor\u00e9 (Pimienta, 1989) and Indestructible (Sony, 1997); explorations of Afro-Cuban religious music such as Babal\u00fa Ay\u00e9 (Bemb\u00e9, 1999) featuring the great Orisha music singer L\u00e1zaro Ros; as well as ambitious projects such as Tierra En Trance (Are\u00edto, 1983) and Misa Negra (Messidor, 1987)\n\nIrakere\u2019s lineup went through many changes over the years. Throughout, Chucho remained as the one, great constant. But success had its costs. Except for the remarkable solo outing Lucama (Mission, 1986), his talent as a pianist was largely out of sight, obscured by his other obligations with the band.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1997, Chucho won his second Grammy for his work on Habana (Verve) as a member of trumpeter Roy Hargrove\u2019s Crisol. The following year, while not completely leaving Irakere behind, Chucho started a parallel career as a solo player and quartet leader, looking for greater opportunities to explore and showcase his playing.\n\n\u201cTwenty five years with the same band is a long time,\u201d said Chucho at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to play solo and with a quartet for some time now. My work as a pianist and soloist gets diluted in Irakere. My job in the group is to be the composer, arranger and musical director and that\u2019s a completely different role.\u201d\n\nChucho stayed with Irakere until 2005.\n\nThe fruitful period that followed is highlighted by albums such as Solo Piano (Blue Note, 1991), Solo: Live in New York (Blue Note, 2001) and New Conceptions (Blue Note, 2003), as well as quartet recordings such as Bele Bele en La Habana (Blue Note, 1998), Briyumba Palo Congo (Blue Note, 1999) and Live at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note, 2000), capturing a performance that features Chucho\u2019s sister, singer Mayra Caridad Vald\u00e9s .

Added to that thick and intriguing sound are a series of dark and ironic lyrics, combining the mood and tone of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds with the narrative force of The Decemberists or a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Adam Turla fills out these sometimes frightening, sometimes beautiful lyrics by conjuring up a cast of character voices, allowing the songs to speak with the force of the characters themselves, and providing the listener with a sense of ensemble unique in rock music.\n\nBut this ensemble feel is not only the result of Turla's vocal playfulness, but of the cohesive playing of the band itself. Sarah Balliet channels her Kentucky bluegrass roots through the skilled hands of a concert cellist, playing point and counterpoint to the lyrics and guitars with magnificent grace and style. [bandmember from=2000]Matt Armstrong's bass guitar provides the rhythmic framework of the band, but also takes the lead with surprising frequency, guiding Murder by Death into driving highs and brooding lows. And Alex Schrodt's drumsticks almost dance across the skins, giving the band what the Chicago Reader called \"a rhythm section Nick Cave or The Faint would die for.\" The result is a fascinating slice of American Gothic, replete with trail rides, whiskey shots and Old Scratch himself.\n\nMurder By Death were discovered in 2000 by Thursday vocalist, Geoff Rickly, when the two bands played on the same bill at a gig in their hometown of Bloomington, Indiana. Rickly introduced the band, known at the time as Little Joe Gould, to his friend Alex Saavedra (owner of Eyeball Records), who signed the group immediately. Rickly performs discreet background vocals in the song Killbot 2000. The Little Joe Gould EP was issued in 2001, the group later deciding on changing the name to Murder By Death, which they felt better represented the \"Americana noir and dramatic post-punk\" of their sound.\n\nMurder by Death's unique sound has developed over several years of touring and recording. Constantly evolving their sound, the style changes from their first release Like The Exorcist, But More Breakdancing to their sophomore release, Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?. \"Who Will Survive...\" grew from a small, limited pressing album into a sleeper hit as they constantly toured the country, sharing the stage with bands as diverse as The Weakerthans, Rasputina, Lucero, Against Me!, and William Elliott Whitmore. \"Who Will Survive...\"'s rich narrative structure, which recounted the travails of a small western town besieged by the devil, not only garnered popular and critical attention, but inspired a number of artistic reactions and responses, including ballet and stage productions, paintings, and even a PhD thesis.\n\nThe band's third album, entitled \"In Bocca al Lupo\", forgoes the integrated narrative structure of \"Who will Survive..., \" presenting the listener with an album built on thematic connections. \"In Bocca al Lupo,\" which translates roughly to \"In the Mouth of the Wolf\" (a phrase said before students take exams in Italian classrooms, and to which the students respond \"Kill the Wolf\"), examines themes of sin, transgression, punishment, and redemption, touching on different lives and different stories in each individual song. The resulting album resembles the 1979 murder mystery from which the band takes its name-a pastiche of bad deeds and good intentions, of last minute heroism and, in some cases, nearly impossible forgiveness.\n\nMusically, \"In Bocca al Lupo\" is as diverse as the various stories that the album recounts. The songs themselves reflect the stories they tell-gritty rock and roll beats drive \"Brother\" and \"Sometimes the Line Walks You,\" complex tango rhythms twine themselves through \"One More Notch,\" and lonely western guitars accompany the simple elegance of \"Shiola\" and \"Raw Deal.\" Each of the album's ballads and waltzes, chants and hard hitting rock songs, meld content and form, creating meaning in the music itself. Murder by Death's unique musical aesthetic ties these seemingly disparate tracks together. With the help of producer J. Robbins (Jets to Brazil, Jawbox, Against Me!) the lush melodies and harmonies so unique to the band transform these varied sounds into a coherent and cohesive album, an album whose overall sound and sensibility melds the darkest moments of Modest Mouse's \"Good News for People Who Love Bad News\" with the maudlin country roots of Western folk-rock. The band's thick, fretted, knotty sound provides a through line, tying together an album as musically diverse as the backcountry roads and basement rooms that inspired it.\n\n\"In Bocca al Lupo,\" on Tent Show Records, the band's own label, shows off Murder by Death's maturity, both as songwriters and musicians. The album is alternately rough and gentle, elegant and complex, intelligent and playful; it moves from one to the other without breaking stride, without interrupting the album as whole. Murder by Death is known for their talent as performers, for their live presence, the ambiance and energy present in their music. \"In Bocca al Lupo\" harnesses this energy and distills it, adding to it the maturity of a band constantly on the road.\n\nRed Of Tooth And Claw\n\nMurder By Death's fourth album, and first with Vagrant Records was released in March 2008, entitled Red Of Tooth And Claw. Produced by Trina Shoemaker at Dark Horse Studios in Tennessee, the record features former keyboardist Vincent Edwards on the song \"Ball & Chain\" and is also the first album to feature new drummer Dagan Thogerson, who replaced founding member Alex Schrodt. It continues with the band's trademark themes: \"lust, betrayal, and classical archetypes of good and evil.\" In Turla's words, the record is an \"Homer\u2019s Odyssey of revenge, only without the honorable character at the center.\" The vocals are again sung in the same low, baritone range as In Bocca Al Lupo causing many critics to speculate that Red Of Tooth And Claw breaks less new ground than previous efforts, although in general the album has been well received. As described by allmusic.com the album \"carries over some of the Old West outlaw feel of its predecessor, but it's more aggressive and freewheeling here. [...] [The album] isn't a departure for Murder By Death, but their ability to keep their sound fresh and vibrant speaks well of their musical abilities.\" To celebrate the album's release, Murder By Death played two shows on the same night in their hometown of Bloomington.\n\nMembers\nAdam Turla - vocals, guitars\nSarah Balliet - cello, keys\nDagan Thogerson - percussion\nMatt Armstrong - bass\n\nPrevious members\nVincent Edwards - keys (left the band in 2004 to pursue an art degree)\nBrandon Cooper - keys mid-2004\nAlex Schrodt - percussion through mid-2007", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Creature Comfort ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8966981.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Alternative, Indie Folk Rock, Indie Pop, Indie Folk, Alternative Rock, Alt Rock, Indie, Prog Indie, Indie Rock, Progressive Indie", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Think of it as Fleet Foxes for people who grew up bailing hay, or your favorite indie record\u2014if that record were scattered, smothered, and covered, of course.", "otherInfo": "Join us live at The East Room for the release of our new single \u201cArcade Fire\u201d"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ultrafaux ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9741792.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Gypsy, Acoustic, Acoustic Gypsy Jazz, Swing, Jazz, Choro, Musette, Funk, Trad Jazz, Folk Jazz", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Baltimore-based Ultrafaux Ensemble, led by guitarist/composer Michael Joseph Harris, performs original acoustic music influenced by Django Reinhardt, Balkan music, be-bop, afro-cuban, funk, Brazilian Choro, and French musette.

Co-Produced and engineered by Brian Fox (Wingtips, Ganser), the new album intertwines classic genres such as Darkwave, Post-Punk and Goth while a richly layered modern Synth-pop sensibility elevates the album to something larger than simple nostalgic recreation.

Comprised of Jo Padilla (lead vocals), Ryan Lammers (guitar), Craig Schwartz Jr. (keyboards), Dean Sinclair (drums), and Cale Singleton (bass), August Hotel has been playing together since 2017, after Padilla sent a grainy smartphone video of themself singing to the rest of the band.

More than two years later, August Hotel\u2019s forthcoming second EP has come together with four new songs that expand on the group\u2019s ability to weave together each member\u2019s specific musical background and influences.

The EP\u2019s accompanying titles strike various tones and moods: urgency, elevation, and melancholy. Produced by Drew Polovick of Friday Pilots Club, this sophomore EP exemplifies the band\u2019s deep passion for the story telling qualities of their carefully crafted music. Constantly progressing as individuals and as a band to produce captivating and complex tunes, August Hotel is poised for a breakthrough.\n\nLive, August Hotel has shared stages with the likes of The Academic, Urban Cone, Nightly, Vesperteen, Young Rising Sons, Twin XL, and Knox Hamilton, as well as headlined clubs around Chicago and the Midwest.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Katy Marquardt ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9188128.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rap, Cover Band, R&b, Country, Rock", "Time": "12:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Katy Marquardt is a piano entertainer based in Chicago, Illinois, but she has played all over the world and even at sea.

She is also the founder of SBS Records.\n\nMalone was born and raised in Atlanta, GA by a musician mom with whom she toured in the summers. She grew up listening to her mother and grandmother sing in the church choir every Sunday when they werent on the road. She dropped out of high school at 16 to begin work on her rock and roll degree. After a few brushes with the law and some unsavory characters, Michelle decided to go back to high school and became the valedictorian for a small class. She attended Agnes Scott College with dreams of becoming a doctor, but was offered a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, which looked alot more interesting to her than more school.\n\nWhen it came time to craft her own sound, she took those religious and secular roots, blended in enough folk, blues and rock to satisfy, and came up with a rootsy high-spirited sound that brings acoustic and electric slide and passionate vocals together harkening back to the lost recordings of Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, and Lucinda Williams.\n\nAfter several major label releases, Malone is now an independent artist with 15 studio records to date and an impressive resume which includes hi profile performances with everyone from Gregg Allman to John Mayer, the Atlanta Symphony to Ellen Degeneres, various awards including best albums, 4x best singer, 3x best acoustic guitarist, and 2 Grammy ballot nominations. Her songs have appeared in such films as Bam Bam and Celeste, All Over Me, Shotgun Jesus and television programs True Blood, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, Brooklyn South. They have been recorded by Indigo Girls (for which she received both gold and platinum records), Antigone Rising, and Vistoso Bosses.\n\nMalone has always made time for philanthropic endeavors such as running the Paris marathon for Team In Training/The Leukemia Society, and cycling with Team Earth Challenge from Atlanta to Yucca Mountain, NV in protest of the nuclear waste dumping. In 2012 she started a college scholarship fund for girls in need. She currently contributes to various women's and children's non-profit organizations, and donates time to local Georgia music organizations and schools.\n\nMalone has performed for TedX Peachtree, sang the National Anthem for The Atlanta Braves and The Houston Comets, been honored with a Signature guitar slide modeled and named after her by Rocky Mountain Slides, was the keynote speaker at a SoCal high school graduation, has been the rhythm guitarist and mandolin player for Kristian Bush (Sugarland), a satellite member of the Indigo Girls, is endorsed by Supro USA Guitars and amps Reunion Blues, and Breedlove guitars and mandolins. Michelle's latest recording, Slings and Arrows, was released March 2018 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Blues charts.\n\nFor tour dates, info and booking or, please visit www.michellemalone.com/contact", "otherInfo": "Join Michelle Malone for a Devil Moon Facebook live at 8:30pm est (so the west coast can join in on the fun)!

He has sold millions of albums, charted 35 singles, 16 of which are Top 40 hits and continues to receive critical acclaim as an actor, writer, and executive producer in film and television.\n\nCyrus was born in Flatwoods, Kentucky on August 25, 1961. His father, Ron Cyrus, was a steelworker who felt a calling to serve his fellow man and became a state legislator and the head of the Kentucky AFL-CIO. He spent 21 years in the Kentucky House of Representatives before retiring from office in 1996. Ron Cyrus was also an accomplished singer in the gospel southern quartet, The Crownsmen, where Cyrus first felt the power of harmonies. (Cyrus yearned to learn how to harmonize with himself and successfully did as he was recently given the title of \u201cThe country Freddy Mercury,\u201d by fellow musician, Shooter Jennings in Rolling Stone magazine.) Additionally, his mother, Ruthie, played piano, his maternal grandfather, Papaw Casto, played the fiddle and his paternal grandfather, Papaw Cyrus, was a Pentecostal preacher. Regular family jam sessions were common in the Cyrus household and often dominated by country, gospel, and old standards.\nBefore music was a priority, Cyrus proved a talent for baseball, and attended Georgetown College on an athletic scholarship. Soon academics and baseball took a backseat to music after he first plucked a six-string. Inspiration called upon Cyrus and his brother to form a country-rock band called Sly Dog. In 1982 they landed a standing gig at an Ironton, Ohio roadhouse which convinced Cyrus to quit school and pursue music professionally. After a fire burned down their home club as well as their gear in 1984, Cyrus dismembered Sly Dog and relocated to Los Angeles in hopes of kick-starting his career. Cyrus\u2019 patience wore thin in California and he was led to pursue new opportunities. He landed at the Ragtime Lounge in Huntington, WV where he would play five nights a week, and on his days off, he would make the drive to Nashville to try and score a \u2018break\u2019.\n\nIn time, Cyrus pulled the attention of legendary music manager, Jack McFadden. Shortly after, Cyrus was invited to open before Reba McEntire in Louisville in 1990, where A&R men from Mercury Records were encouraged to attend and give him consideration. After seeing the crowd\u2019s reaction to Cyrus\u2019 set, they quickly offered him a recording contract. At that very time, Cyrus was quoted in a local newspaper article saying, \u201cThis is my Super Bowl,\u201d referring to the fact that he was either going to win it or lose it.\n\nCyrus went on to make history with the debut of his studio album, Some Gave All. The album hit No. 1 on the Billboard album charts, where it held the position for 17 consecutive weeks; a record he still holds as a solo male artist.\n\nThroughout the early 90s, Cyrus had a string of releases off the album that bulleted up the charts, including \u201cAchy Breaky Heart,\u201d \u201cCould\u2019ve Been Me,\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019m Gonna Live When I Get Home,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s Not Cryin\u2019 Anymore\u201d and the title track, \u201cSome Gave All,\u201d which earned Cyrus the Bob Hope Award for Excellence in Entertainment.\nFollowing encouragement from his dad, Cyrus began acting. He landed a role in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive in 2001. Simultaneously, Cyrus continued to create music, but casting calls were plentiful. Not too long after, he accepted the lead role in a cable television series, Doc, in which he played Dr. Clint Cassidy, a physician from the Deep South who relocates to the bright and flashy New York City.\nIn 2006, Cyrus' daughter Miley was cast in the title role of the Disney situation comedy Hannah Montana as an ordinary teenager who beams as a pop star. Cyrus co-starred as her father and manager, Robby Ray Stewart.\n\nAlthough he had become a sought after actor, he stayed committed as an always consummate singer-songwriter. As Cyrus put it, \u201cI became an actor, but I was born a singer-songwriter from Flatwoods, KY. That\u2019s who I am. I lived the music and I couldn\u2019t help but write about it.\u201d Behind the scenes, Cyrus continued to write. While watching Miley leave for California, he wrote \u201cReady, Set, Don\u2019t Go,\u201d which ultimately became a worldwide smash.\n\nIn between roles, Cyrus released Wanna Be Your Joe in 2006 and he also enjoyed chart success with the Hannah Montana album, which featured the father-daughter anthem \"Butterfly Fly Away\u201d as a duet with Miley.\nA feature film, Hannah Montana: The Movie, spawned from the popular network show. Cyrus was a producer and was integral in bringing the movie to be shot on location in Tennessee.\n\nIn January 2011, Hannah Montana concluded after 101 episodes. The conclusion of his time with Disney lead Cyrus to reflect on his career and conduct his autobiography, Hillbilly Heart, which was released in April of 2013. The autobiography unveiled his tenacious struggle to claim peace with faith, family, and the power of music.\n\nCombining much of his expertise, Cyrus appeared as the sharp lawyer, Billy Flynn, in the Broadway production of Chicago throughout the Hurricane Sandy devastation that hit much of New York City in late 2012. His next studio release, Change My Mind, was inspired by much of the disaster he witnessed during his time in the Big Apple.\n\nCurrently, Cyrus has numerous new projects in the works including the premiere of a new television series on CMT, \u201cStill The King,\u201d in which he shares writing and executive-production credits. Cyrus stars as the center role of \u201cBurnin\u2019\u201d Vernon Brown, a one-hit wonder who becomes an Elvis impersonator after a wreck into an old country church outside of Nashville during a drunken bender, he is sentenced to return and perform community service. Along the way he pretends to be the congregation\u2019s new minister and re-connects with a former one-night-stand (Joey Lauren Adams), only to discover he has a 15-year-old daughter he\u2019s never met.\n\nHis expansive career highlights his talent to the utmost. An anticipated forthcoming studio album titled Thin Line is set to release this fall. Included on the album is \u201cHey Elvis,\u201d a collaboration Cyrus re-invented with Bryan Adams and the legendary \u201cVoice of Rock,\u201d Glenn Hughes.\n\nAround the world, it is without a doubt that Billy Ray Cyrus is a household name and will continue to be recognized through generations.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "DJ So Hype ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7069503.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "DJ So Hype", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Derrick Reeves, known as Hype or DJ So Hype, is an American DJ and producer of segway music. \u201cHype\u201d, meaning extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion., suits his personality and skill-set perfectly when talking about his craft. This is due to his well-known ability to work with any genre of music, or combination of multiple genres at one time, to produce dynamic and high energy music sets. In addition Hype is quite known by most in the industry for possessing one of the most critical skill-sets of being a professional DJ, which is the ability to read the crowd and change a performance on-the-fly in order to keep the energy of the event high. It is because of these two aspects that the name \u201cHype\u201d became perfectly fitting. But no matter what you call him or whether or not you\u2019ve ever seen him perform, one thing is for sure, when he\u2019s performing for you, you will surely know it. A triple threat of music talent, personality, and fashion sense Hype has become a member in a class all his own.\n\nHailing from Las Vegas, Nevada Hype has rightfully established himself in the most elite class of DJs, continuously and regularly playing all venues and events ever worth mentioning in this global mecca of nightlife alongside just about any major artist you can think of in today\u2019s pop culture. As the resident DJ since 2004 of some of Vegas\u2019 hottest clubs and lounges including Rum Jungle, Jet Nightclub & Koi Nightclub inside of the Planet Hollywood. Hype has also resided at Town Square since the Grand Opening in 2007 as still a Senior in High School every Friday & Saturday for Nu Sanctuary & Blue Martini, located inside of Town Square. Additionally, Hype is known for frequently playing such venues as Revolution, Gold Lounge, Foundation Room, Neche, and Chateau. As you can see (if you are familiar with any of the hotspots in Las Vegas Nightlife from the last 12 years to present) there isn\u2019t a place in the Las Vegas area that he hasn\u2019t blown the roof off of.\n\nAdditionally, when he\u2019s not tearing it up in Sin City he also regularly jet-sets all the top entertainment meccas that this country has worth mentioning (LA, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Miami). 2018 marks his twelfth year running with a continuous residency on the Las Vegas Strip. Hype can also be found heating up tours across the country with some of your favorite artists to date. But no matter where you see him it\u2019s guaranteed to be a night to remember so come prepared. And as you can see there is a reason why so many of his peers call him \u201cThe Hardest Working Man In The Business\u201d (averaging between 300 and 350 performances a year, due to performing multiple times daily throughout the Las Vegas Club & Community Scene).\n\n-EARLY LIFE\nThe middle brother of three, Shift was born in Ridgecrest, California. After living there for 3 months after his birth his mother moved to Inglewood, California. His mother, worked as a Surgical Tech a good life early on for the family, while be a single mother with 3 boys. He can remember many times as a kid being in the company of his mother growing up listening to Theo from 92.3 in Souther California which developed his love for music from Old to New. Soon after that the family was relocated to Henderson, Nevada when he was thirteen years old. It was during this part of his life that he was extensively exposed deejaying by the last day of school of 2003 by finding 1 turntable & 1 mixer in the trash can. Soon after receiving the abandoned DJ equipment, Hype 3 days later used his saved up lunch money to purchase 1 more turntable from the pawn shop. For a full 4 months Hype practiced only using 3 vinyls, Rick James \"Mary Jane\", Talib Kweli's \"Get By\" & Wu-Tangs \"Triump\". Hype attended Green Valley High School where he ran Varsity Cross Country and Track, JV BasketBall, President of the Krump Club & President of the Student Body Club. Outside of school he was also very active in the deejaying house parties, school dancers & a popular teen nightclub called \"Club Frozen\" while working at a Dry Cleaners part time along with working full time for 97.5 (Partially responsible for his name \u201cHype\u201d). Close to graduation Hype wanted to attend college for the Computer Tech field, however do to his very social demeanor and deep passion for music and nightlife throughout his life he quickly knew that something in those areas was definitely where he belonged.\n\n-CAREER\nAt age 16 he became a the most known DJ to be the youngest DJ on the Las Vegas strip . It was from then on he realized his strong desire for being the life force of the party and delved into the world of the nightlife industry primarily deejaying and periodically independently hosting for nightclubs & events. It is here where he thrived and ultimately began to feel more comfortable and likely to succeed. After befriending many club owners and DJs (both nightlife and radio personalities alike) he realized what he always knew to be true, that he wanted to be solely responsible for the energy of the party. Being a host he had experienced this to an extent but it was quite obvious that the DJ Booth is where he needed to be and given his extensive relationship with music, this is the direction he decided to head. Shift taught himself primarily on his own all the ins and outs of his craft, by simple trial and error and training his ear from watching and listening to the never ending talent from DJ Jazzy Jeff & Grand Wizard Theodore. So with his newfound skills, passion for music, and expanding relationships in this ideal arena Hype became an aggressively progressive self-made man in order to establish his place in the stars. And although Hype has accomplished a lot he maintains the utmost level of humility and gratefulness for his accomplishments. His plans are to now hone his pre-existing skills to music itself by producing his own sound. So stay tuned for the next chapter in Hype's history, this is where it gets fun.\n\n-PERSONAL LIFE\nEven though being a DJ occupies much of his life there are many different aspects that Hype makes great strides to incorporate and maintain in his personal life. His mother helps to keep him humble and grounded, and the ability to travel has always been a very important. Shift has continued from a very young age to paint, dance & run his own magazine, which led to his art being sold world wide and displayed in galleries seen in New York, his dancing career leading him to work alongside with the Jabbawockeez and appear in many commercials under KIA and to selling over 900,000 physical magazines that won \"Magazine of the Year\" in Las Vegas. n addition, Hype is an hard working, laid back & funny man amongst friends. A little later in life he thoroughly looks forward to building a school of his own and that represents the 4 elements of Hip Hop.\n\n-DISCOGRAPHY\nHype has released multiple mixes over the years that can be found on his Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/djsohype\nAfter high school Hype was more motivated to being successful since he had more time on his hands with school out of the way. WIth working at the radio station as a full time job Hype still managed to rock parties & clubs every weekend. On Easter Sunday 2008 Hype was invited to do a event later that evening for a mansion party. Along the way to the event So Hype was involved in a fatal car accident which caused his life. All of the equipment from the 200 vinyl records, Mac Book, Headphones, Speakers, Microphones, External Hard Drive, Table & more were all destroyed in the accident . Not only losing all his equipment and totaling his vehicle So Hype also passed away in the accident. Hype's mother \"Rose Reeves\" heard about the accident from some friends of So Hype and rushed to the accident to see if her son was ok. Paramedics, Police & Firefighters rushed to the accident 35 minutes after impact and immediately checked on the other vehicle that caused the accident while Hype was already dead in his vehicle with no help or attention. Thats when his mother yelled and demanded that Hype gets some attention and help from the paramedics as then they rushed to check on Hype for when they soon pronounced Derrick Reeves dead at 8:55 pm. Paramedics were going to put Hype in a body bag but his mother couldn't bare to see her son in a body bag so she beg the medic not to do it in front of her. They decided to put Hype in the ambulance and take him to the coroners office while after 45 minutes of being dead from the impact to the ambulance ride So Hype woke up. Paramedics quickly rushed him to St. Rose Dominican Hospital to make sure that he stays alive. WIthout any medical insurance at the time the hospital released Hype under his mother's care after being in the hospital for 2 hours. Week & weeks after the accident Hype had to put himself into therapy at home from not being able to walk due to nerve damage from the strikes to his back and body weakness. Hype's only help was from his mother and support from his fans but without equipment, Hype lost everything & was out of the DJ scene due to the time that he had to recover. Clubs and Promoters for parties had no other choice but to work with other djays which left Hype out of a job. Throughout time Hype became very depressed and lost with the feeling that he didn't have anything to hold on to anymore. With no equipment and the fact of him losing his name DJ So Hype, not being able to doing any gigs within less in a year Hype lost all motivation and inspiration to being a DJ. Hype was 1 step away from joining the military and becoming a metro police officer.\n\nLate 2008 it was all So Hype's mother which was the one to influence and pursued him into following his dreams and to do what he was born to do and that was music. Hype, his mother and from a little bit of help from his father \"David Reeves\" they came together to invest into some new equipment. Hype was now motivated into getting his name back out there and to let the public know that So Hype didn't go anywhere. With So Hype balancing 2 full time jobs along with a part time job So Hype invested into some equipment in no time. Late January 2009 Hype was back into the party scene as he slowly was getting his reputation back. It was very difficult for Hype to get his name out there due to his absence from the accident. Everyone looked at him as a new up and coming DJ since he was no longer the young sensation DJ that vegas knew him as. It was now that So Hype really had to prove himself to be taken seriously as a DJ.\n\nWith hours and hours of practice So Hype managed to gain his skills as a DJ but now even on a higher level to where his skills were unlike you would regularly see from any other DJ. Hype demanded attention from not only the locals but now the world. With him now being diverse and fluent with his talent So Hype was demanded quickly for weekly events. From going back to coming from nothing and turning it into something Hype was on a take over.\n\nDuring the success of Hype's overwhelming recovery he continued to take Las Vegas by storm by participating in any and everything that he can step his foot into. With help from his mother she got connected with the After-School All-Stars in Las Vegas to have Hype to donate his time by being a regular DJ for them for charity events. From time to time So Hype would attend back in night clubs as only a guest dj but it took one night from djaying in Tao night club to where Hype was discovered by a A.R. Rep for the \"Black Eyed Peas\" and was very impressed by Hype's sensational djaying to where he immediately approached Hype with a job. He told Hype to call him the next day as soon as he woke up for a phone conversation. The next day So Hype was offered to do a 3 date tour with the \"Black Eyed Peas\" with 2 shows in California and 1 in Phoenix, AZ. Hype quickly accepted and was now on his first tour which took place in September 2009.\n\nFor the year of 2009 So Hype was already a motivational speaker for young teens in Las Vegas to talk about his career and how important it is to stay in school but to still believe in yourself to amount to anything that you want to be. Continued with working with his charity and attending other charities as well to give back to kids for the Y.M.C.A., Boys & Girls Club, Lend a Hand Charity, After-School All-Stars & Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. From 2005 to 2009 Hype has raised up to $10,000 to donate to charities in Las Vegas. During that year Hype appeared as one of the Hamsters in the first Kia Commercial. Hype continued the rest of the year by taking Vegas by storm by being known as the DJ that you needed to book.\n\nNot even 21 yet and So Hype was already traveling and still attending to do clubs on the strip and weekly 18+ events. Still at the radio station Hype would air on the radio doing phone pranks as a imitator and daily commercials spots for Las Vegas Clubs, Clothing Lines, Fast Food Restaurants and Movies. Summer of 2010 So Hype already had over 20 clubs on his belt and thats not including the out of state clubs. Hype was invited numerous times to Houston, Texas to DJ for Paul Wall, Chamilionair & Lil Jon. Hype was flown out to South Beach Miami, Florida to DJ on the Beach for Fat Joe & Rick Ross. Towards then end of summer So Hype go to meet one his biggest inspirations in the music business which was \"Morris Day & the Time\". Hype was accepted to do a all Down South Tour with Morris Day and the Time. Labor Day weekend So Hype was invited to fly back out to Miami to DJ at the Mansion Club with celebrity \"Lil Bow Wow\" with special guest \"Mike Epps & Snookie\". Soon as Hype got back home he was sponsored by Sean John Clothing and was djaying for the clothing line thru out the outlet stores in Las Vegas. Hype began started working with Councilman Ricky Barlow & Commissioner Lawrence Weekly in Las Vegas as their main DJ for any events and government events as well. In December 2010 Hype had a opportunity by the help of his mother to fly out to New York to DJ at Madison Square Garden for Celebrity R&B Sensation \"Trey Songz\" for a winter jam concert with performances by \"50 Cent, Fat Joe, Lil Mama, New Boyz, Ne-Yo & Cali Swagg DIstrict\".\n\nEarly January 2011 So Hype was already a household name and was talked about across the U.S. about his impeccable djaying skills. Hype continued to do weekly event in the local area as well as continuing to travel around the West Coast doing local shows, concerts, clubs and parties. Hype's New Year resolution was to become a resident DJ in a club on the strip in Las Vegas by 2012. In March 2011 So Hype quit the radio station 97.5 after being with them for 4 years to pursue his career full-time to dedication his time only into his first love which is music. With walking away Hype managed to own his own business by doing nothing but djaying, teaching dance class for his charity, designing websites, creating DJ So Hype shirts & flyer designs. Not bad for a 22 year old that only works for hisself and answers to no one. In April 2011 So Hype launch his very own website www.djsohype.com which was designed and built by So Hype to release his first mixture after his accident which was titled \"The Take Over\" which received over 100 downloads in the first day which put Hype in the status of setting the bar of making a DJ mixtape. Hype was got 5,000 hits on his website within his first month after the launch. Hype's goal is to put out mixture every other week and is known as the DJ to put out 5 mixtapes less then 2 months. Hype's goal in his mixtures is to bring back good music that he feels that people are missing today, so he starts with the old and will continue to put out tapes with the new.\n\nSummer 2011 So Hype was still a guest DJ a various clubs in Vegas as well as opening up for one of his mentors DJ Kid Capri until he became at a small hookah lounge in South Las Vegas called \"Laziza\" which led him to be a resident DJ at Nu Sanctuary Lounge located in Town Square Las Vegas after 2 weeks with being the fist DJ to ever have a event on a Sunday Night at that club. So Hype continues to pull in a miraculous crowd every Sunday. September 2011 So Hype's manager/mother signed him up for a DJ battle in Las Vegas at Mcfadden's which was located inside the Rio Hotel on the Strip. Their were 50 DJ's that signed up for this competition to battle it out win a new set of turn tables, $2,000 cash & a chance to be a resident DJ every week at Mcfadden's. The winner would be decided off of crowd decision and after 10 long weeks DJ So Hype was crowned as Las Vegas' 2011 DJ Battle Champion and won the prizes along with the chance to be the resident DJ at Mcfadden's. Word got around fast about the So Hype winning the battle and gave So Hype the respect that he always deserved as not being known as the rookie DJ anymore. With being the youngest DJ out of the whole battle he earned respect that he was not to be doubted. Weeks later on the slowest night that So Hype ever had at Nu Sanctuary with an attendance of only 9 people there were 3 people that stayed throughout the night grooving to the sounds of DJ So Hype and approached Hype by letting him know that he was actually trying out with any notice. As curious Hype was they told him that he has a opportunity to DJ at the V Bar located inside the Venetian on the Las Vegas strip. Halloween weekend 2011 So Hype impressed not only V Bar but the Hotel (The Venetian) with his diverse djaying skills. Which put him automatically in the spot as a rotating djaying at the club. Not even being December yet So Hype was already a resident DJ at 3 clubs within 4 months with living up to his New Years resolution hoping that he would be in that position by the first of the year. At the this time of being the age of 22 So Hype is now known as the youngest resident DJ to DJ on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSo Hype continues to represent the DJ throughout his records, mix tapes & live shows. His love of music shines through on all projects, whether its with celebrities or his own solo music. Over the course of his career Hype has achieved many accomplishments at a young age, but he is a humble man who is still doing it for the love of music. And with that approach he will continue doing what he love for as long as he wants.", "otherInfo": "MAKE SURE TO TUNE IN & TURN UP WITH ME LIVE ON WWW.DJSOHYPE.COM AS I PRESENT TO YOU \u201cFRIDAY NIGHT HYPE\u201d EVERY FRIDAY FROM 6PM-8PM PST.

Artists like Rush, Marillion and Gordon Lightfoot have taken a shine to Moon's\nrenditions of their songs and have lavished him praise and a spotlight that has gained him\ninternational attention. It is these inventive covers that draws the fans in, but it's Moon's\noriginal material and his compelling live show that make them pull up a chair.\n\nRon Sexsmith has said: \"Jacob Moon is an exceedingly gifted and watchable\nperformer....seems completely at home on stage\" and Danny Miranda (bassist for Queen)\nconcurs \"Tremendous command of the instrument...amazing voice. I can honestly say that I\nam overwhelmed by his music\".\n\nJacob Moon is known for his giftedness as a singer, songwriter of award-winning pop and\nfolk songs. He is also a master of the art of \u2018live looping\u2019, a performance style where he\nrecords what he\u2019s playing in real time and layers sound on sound to make one guitar sound\nlike an orchestra. His faith and his passion for social justice has led him to advocate and raise funds for many organizations over the years, including his current position as national ambassador for Compassion Canada and International Justice Mission.\n\n\nINFLUENCES:\nJacob Moon considers himself first and foremost to be a singer-songwriter. The songs he has\nwritten have gone on to win awards in International Song Competitions (Unisong, Great\nLakes Song Contest, West Coast Songwriters, GMA Canada). His songwriting heroes\ninclude Jackson Browne, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Peter Gabriel and Rich Mullins, and\nMoon's timeless and eclectic style can be compared to those artists, among others. Likewise,\nhis music is hard to pigeonhole, and Moon is okay with that. \"My music is borne from all the\nlistening I've done over the years, and I listen to a lot of different music. In a way it makes\nsense that what comes out would be a mash-up of all those different influences, and tough\nto pin a style on\", Moon says.\n\nThough not exactly born with a guitar in his hands, Moon's own father had a 12-string Gibson\nthat made an impression early on. \"It just had this huge sound-- it sounded like an orchestra\nto me\", Moon says. That would prove instructive as he approached learning the acoustic\nguitar in his early teens. \"My musical influences at that time were bands like Yes,\nRush and Marillion, so I was trying to figure out how to make the guitar sound as big as I\nknew it could sound from hearing those guys\".\n\nIN THE LOOP:\nOnce Moon had completed his musical training at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo,\nON, he began recording and trying to find as many gigs as he could to stay alive. Realizing\nthat he needed something that would set him apart from other performers, Moon began\nexperimenting with 'live looping' technology--a foot-pedal that triggers the instantaneous\nrecording of his guitar while he's playing live. This gave Moon a whole new palette to paint\nwith musically, and he has gone on to be one of the leading Loopers on the scene.\nHis popular live-looping music videos on YouTube recently gained attention on a national\nlevel, when rock legends Rush asked Moon to perform at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of\nFame Gala. Geddy, Neil and Alex insisted that Moon to be there to play 'Subdivisions', which\nhe performed on a Hamilton rooftop in his 2008 video (now at over 350, 000 hits). His\nperformance was immediately followed by a standing ovation from his heroes, and that one\nnight has led to some exciting new touring opportunities.\n\nRush drummer Neil Peart had this to say about Jacob: \"We all shared Jacob Moon\u2019s\nperformance of Subdivisions quite a long time ago and sent it to each other, \u2018Hey have you\nseen this?\u2019 because it\u2019s such a beautiful cover. The imaginative way that he uses the little\ncassette player to get my voice in there. It\u2019s superb. And it is that kind of song. It\u2019s a singersongwriter\u2019s\nsong. I loved to see his version of it and I loved the idea that song has endured\nto his generation.\u201d\n\nJacob performed for Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in September 2016 when a park was named in their honour in their hometown of Toronto. Mayor John Tory gave them both the key to the city in a ceremony that featured Jacob performing 'Subdivisions' for a large crowd of Rush fans and the guests of honour.\n\nIn December 2016, Rush released a new version of 2112, featuring Jacob Moon's cover of the last song on that seminal hit for the band, entitled 'Something for Nothing'. Other artists covering Rush include Foo Fighters, Stephen Wilson, Alice in Chains and Billy Talent.\n\nAlso in 2016, Jacob Moon formed The Commissionaires, a rootsy soul gospel band, with singer Joel Parisien. They released their debut record, 'Shelter Me' and have been touring ever since, working on new music for an upcoming release later this year.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Tim Bluhm ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9223381.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Rock And Roll", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Tim Bluhm has earned a reputation as the quintessential California musician. Born and raised in the Golden State, as the singer/guitarist and primary songwriter of rock band The Mother Hips, Bluhm has spent the last two decades performing, writing, collaborating on, and producing music.\n\nCalifornia is a constant source of inspiration for Bluhm, and like the wildly diverse state, his influences are sprawling, beautiful and multifarious. Bluhm\u2019s music, as an acclaimed solo artist as well as with the Hips, his duo project Skinny Singers with Jackie Greene, fronting The Rhythm Devils (featuring The Grateful Dead\u2019s Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann), Ball-Point Birds (duo with Hips co-founder Greg Loiacono), and in his wife\u2019s band Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers, is a timeless mix of classic rock, Americana, California country, folk, psychedelic blues, and power-pop. Though varied and ambitious, Bluhm never sounds disjointed, his work always tied together by impeccable songwriting.\n\nBluhm grew up listening to eight-track tapes of Leon Russell, Jim Croce, Anne Murray, and The Beach Boys. He got his first taste of singing in the church choir and it was Neil Young\u2019s Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere that inspired him to pick up a guitar. Captivated at an early age, Bluhm has always been connected to music\u2019s spiritual capacity. \u201cThe transformative power of music is really the best part\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s why so many of us are obsessed with music.\u201d\n\nAlthough The Mother Hips were courted by major labels and signed to Rick Rubin\u2019s American Recordings while still in college, they\u2019ve yet to receive the riches of rock stardom. Instead Tim Bluhm settled into a prolific, slow-burning career adored by many yet virtually unknown in the mainstream. Along the way Bluhm has shared the stage with such luminaries as Johnny Cash, Wilco, The Black Crowes, Widespread Panic, Lucinda Williams, M. Ward, Cracker, John Hiatt, and Phil Lesh to name a few.\n\nWhile The Mother Hips were constantly touring up and down California\u2019s coast, Bluhm became infatuated with surfing. In 1997 he purchased a Toyota pick-up with a camper shell and began drifting from town to town, spending his days in the water and crashing in the truck. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches the Toyota wasn\u2019t the most comfortable accommodations and was soon replaced by a legendary van that Bluhm called home until 2003.\n\n2006 offered Bluhm, Bay Area musician Jackie Greene, and engineer Dave Simon-Baker the opportunity to open Mission Bells Studio where Bluhm has produced albums for the Hips, Jackie Greene, Hot Buttered Rum, Dave Brogan, Little Wings, and the studio has hosted Phil Lesh, Los Lobos, Rogue Wave, Jonathan Richman, Josh Ritter, and ALO.\n\nIn 2005 Bluhm teamed up with San Diego-based singer/songwriter/guitarist Steve Poltz and combined his love of the outdoors with his passion for music with The High Sierra Singer/Songwriter Workshop. The unique four day backcountry experience offers attendees the opportunity to write songs and learn from two of California\u2019s most renowned songwriters in one of the country\u2019s most amazing locations.\n\nBluhm and his bandmates further blurred the lines between Mother Nature and music by launching The Mother Hips Family Hipnic in 2009. A two day festival set in gorgeous Big Sur, CA hosted by the Hips, \u201cit\u2019s everything I like about music festivals\u201d says Bluhm; \u201cgreat acts, pristine surroundings and no crowds.\u201d 2010 was an even greater success and all signs point to an annual outing where fans will continue to flock.\n\nWhen not touring the world in a rock band, producing albums, surfing, skiing, camping and hiking, Tim Bluhm lives with his wife Nicki in their San Francisco home.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nina Baumer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10368288.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Pop, R&b", "Time": "1:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago-born and Australian-raised, 22-year-old singer-songwriter Nina Baumer developed her love for music and songwriting from a young age.

Pepper and Abbey Road eras and beyond.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, the band has toured extensively since its founding in 1997 -- performing at hundreds of venues throughout the U.S. and in many countries across the globe, including Japan, Malaysia, France, Hong Kong, The United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil -- where they've skillfully recreated the Beatles' music multiple thousands of times, yet always with a freshness and excitement that audiences love.\n\nWhat makes The Fab Four unique among Beatles tribute bands is the not-so-simple fact that the four band members play all their own music live. This is just one more factor that gives their performances an energy and immediacy that backing tracks and sequencers can\u2019t.\n\nConsidering the complexity of the Beatles\u2019 later work and the fact that it was never intended to be performed live, what The Fab Four do onstage is phenomenal. Without a \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d anywhere in sight to make their job easier, these four highly accomplished musicians recreate all the sounds of an incredibly diverse catalog of Beatles favorites 100 percent live and in real time -- and their technical precision, musical artistry, and onstage chemistry make every concert a stunning performance!\n\nAudiences will appreciate their dynamic stage presence and the almost boundless energy that keeps them moving around the stage practically non-stop throughout the night, as they systematically move through the different Beatles eras, changing costumes between sets to represent the early Beatlemania years, the Sgt. Pepper/psychedelic era, and the Abbey Road period and beyond, with many shows also including a Shea Stadium set.\n\nThe band typically changes costumes twice, for a total of three period-perfect looks: the identical black chesterfield suits worn by the original lads during their Ed Sullivan Show debut, the colorful satin Sgt. Pepper uniforms and regalia worn by the Beatles during their psychedelic era, and the totally divergent clothing styles that marked the later Beatles and post-Beatles years. Select shows also feature the beige safari-style jackets and black trousers that have come to be known as the Beatles' Shea Stadium suits.\n\nThe band also periodically plays specialty shows for various Beatles-related anniversaries, such as shows that feature an entire Beatles album, played from start to finish, along with additional selections from the rest of the Beatles' extensive catalog. True to the material and era they cover, each of these shows brings in additional, highly authentic costumes from the period.\n\nThe Fab Four truly are The Ultimate Tribute to The Beatles -- the most accurate representation of the originals you'll find this side of the 1960s!", "otherInfo": "Emmy\u00ae Award-winning Beatles tribute band The Fab Four celebrates the 50th Anniversary of LET IT BE with a LIVE recreation of the music from the Beatles' swan song.\n\nDig It!

I picked up my first guitar when I was 11 years old and soon learned that I could create my own stories three minutes at a time.

We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d\n\nMusic was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal.\n\nAbout this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric.\n\nThrough countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started.\n\nFor Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones.\n\n\u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d\n\nCobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart.

Inspired by the \"hip-hop band\" concept pioneered by Stetsasonic, the Roots themselves have garnered critical acclaim and influenced later hip-hop and R&B acts.\n\nThe Roots' original lineup included Black Thought (MC vocals) and Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson (drums), who were classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on the streets, they added another MC named Malik B., a bassist named Leonard Hubbard, and a keyboardist Scott Storch. Another MC, Dice Raw, frequently made album appearances with the group from 1995 to 1999 before leaving to record a solo album. Scott Storch also left to pursue career as a producer following the Do You Want More?!!!??! album. The Roots filled his void with another keyboardist, Kamal who is still a member. A beatboxer named Rahzel also joined the group and contributed from 1995-1999. Alongside Rahzel was vocal turntablist, Scratch who greatly contributed to The Roots' sound, most notably in live concerts. He left the group in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 2000 due to drug problems. A guitarist, Ben Kenney, enjoyed a short stint with the group and contributed to their Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus. A percussionist, Knuckles, was added in 2002 and guitarist, Kirk Douglas (a.k.a. \"Captain Kirk\") repleaced Kenney. A vocalist, Martin Luther toured with The Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to their album The Tipping Point. The current members of The Roots are Black Thought (MC vocals), ?uestlove (drums), Hub (bass), Kamal (keyboard), Knuckles (percussion), and Captain Kirk (guitar).\n\nThe Roots' debut album, Organix, was actually a live recording from a concert in Germany that the Roots sold at their shows. The album earned enough industry buzz to earn the Roots offers from major record labels, and they signed with DGC records, which at the time was better known for its grunge music releases.\n\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??! (recorded live without the use of samples), was a moderate hit on alternative radio. Their 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to crack the Top 40 on Billboard's album chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\", a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s such as the \"beatdown shot,\" and \"Clones\" which was their first to single to reach the top five on the rap charts.\n\nIn 1999, The Roots released Things Fall Apart (named after a novel by Chinua Achebe), their breakthrough album. The track \"You Got Me\", duet with r'n'b singer Erykah Badu, earned them a Grammy award for Best rap Performance By A Duo Or Group.\n\nIn 2000, Dice Raw left the group to record his solo debut album, Reclaiming the Dead.\n\nThe Roots' reputation as a hip-hop live band made Jay-Z call on them for his MTV Unplugged album in 2002. The album featured good recreations of many of his great songs, played by the band with a little help from female vocalist Jaguar Wright.\n\n2002's Phrenology introduced a more mainstream sound for the Roots, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. The album's sales were boosted by radio and TV airplay for two duets on the album, \"break u off\" (featuring Musiq) and \"The Seed 2.0\" (featuring Cody ChesnuTT). The video for \"The Seed 2.0\" earned a nomination for the MTV2 Award at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"The Seed\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the Mandy Moore movie Chasing Liberty. Phrenology was certified gold (signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units) in June 2003.\n\nThe Roots' 2004 release, The Tipping Point, took its name from a 2000 book by Malcolm Gladwell. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track \"Star\", and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track \"Don't Say Nuthin'\". The album was an immediate hit, debuting at #4 on the Billboard album chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nOn November 15, 2005 The Roots released two compilation albums, Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide To Understanding The Roots, Volumes 1 & 2. These two separately sold discs are a compilation of past hits, live performances, and rare remixes compiled by ?uestlove himself.

I picked up my first guitar when I was 11 years old and soon learned that I could create my own stories three minutes at a time.

I recorded and released \u201cFinger on the Trigger\u201d my debut studio album, won Jim Halsey\u2019s StarMaker Search music video contest, and performed shows opening for country greats Shenandoah and Clint Black.

Zane began honing his chops in LA's vibrant music circuit on his 12th birthday and later refined his style at USC's prestigious Thornton School of Music, becoming one of the most in-demand guitarists on both coasts in the process. Possessing an exciting and extremely rare combination of creativity and virtuosity, along with an audiophile's ear for guitar tone and an extraordinary ability to sightread, Zane has been referred to as \"The best guitarist in NY and LA\" by Bono of U2. More recently, John Mayer handpicked Zane to play guitar on his current world tour and latest album, sans audition, after Mayer discovered Zane's fiery performances online. But with his newfound passion for writing and singing his own material, Zane is quickly gaining significant attention as a lead vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. While Zane's guitar playing has been described as daring, passionate, soulful, and jaw-dropping - tremendous labels for a young man many are proclaiming to be the next great guitar hero - Zane is now rapidly accumulating equally praiseworthy descriptions about his compositions and vocal abilities. As people witness Zane's evolution from gunslinging guitarist to full-fledged frontman, comparisons to the early days surrounding the release of John Mayer's debut EP \"Inside Wants Out\" have even been serendipitously drawn. Bob Lefsetz has raved about CARNEY - where Zane began his meteoric rise as a lead guitarist - likening the band's sound to \"a mysterious trip into the heart of darkness.\" But, Zane's original songs lean slightly away from the raw and brooding Rock and Roll that defined CARNEY as they gravitate towards his roots in Jazz, Blues and Pop. His songwriting style is grounded in visual storytelling, honesty, surrender and hope and his melodies, while imaginative and adventurous, are irresistibly catchy and instantly familiar. Zane's lyrics have been likened to those of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray LaMontagne, and his voice has been compared to singing icons Jeff Buckley, Damien Rice, and Jimmy Gnecco. This unique combination of masterful guitars, unforgettable hooks, and emotively provoking lyrics - all expressed with his profoundly moving and honest voice - is what makes Zane such a one-of-a-kind talent; one that seems poised to join not only the greats of his generation, but those who've come before him. Live performance is where Zane's most inherent gift shines; his undeniably infectious charisma - one that captivates the audience the instant he takes the stage.

The vocal performance by band co-founder Serena Pryne was so gut-wrenching and so emotionally draining, mining the very depths of her soul that she practically collapsed into the arms of superstar producer GGGarth Richardson when it was over. That vocal take and the similarly powerhouse performances from her bandmates, came to be the template and benchmark for the rest of the album. \u201cI knew it was a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it and I was a little intimidated to record it\u201d said Pryne. \u201cHe let me do my thing and just pour everything I had into the microphone. He said I would know when I was done.\u201d From that moment on, that song set the tone for the rest of the record. \u201cI don\u2019t know if GGGarth knew it ahead of time and planned it with that song, because he would always reference Don\u2019t Ask if we were struggling at any other moment. He set the entire tone based on that track,\u201d said guitarist and band co-founder Nick Lesyk. The entirety of Windows and Stones is just as creatively, spiritually and emotionally intense and takes the listener on an aural and experiential journey that they won\u2019t soon forget. This too is emblematic of The Mandevilles\u2019 \u2018leave it all on the floor\u2019 approach to writing, recording and especially performing the music live. And it\u2019s music that couldn\u2019t be more straightforward and unpretentious in its approach and delivery. No studio trickery, experimental flights of fancy or self-indulgence - just rock and roll. \u201cBeing a Canadian, I think it\u2019s funny that I describe it as American rock and roll. I say that because it\u2019s reminiscent of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp, Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen - all rolled into one. Our music comes from the same place.\u201d said Lesyk. Pryne and Lesyk are the creative nucleus of The Mandevilles and have been musical partners for nearly 15 years, although both bring significantly different musical influences to the table. \u201cSerena\u2019s influences are steeped more in the roots of rock and roll whereas mine are a little more contemporary. But there are a lot of commonalities: we love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. And then there are newer songwriters like Ryan Adams and Jason Isbell,\u201d said Lesyk. As the frontwoman for the band, Pryne is the focal point and centre of attention for the band for both her force-of-nature stage presence and her amazingly dynamic and unmistakably authentic whisky-soaked voice. \u201cI played in a blues band when I was a kid. That definitely shaped the sound of my voice. Even though I don\u2019t listen to blues records all the time there is just something about it that I gravitate to \u2013 it was natural for me,\u201d Pryne said. \u201cAnd oddly enough I didn\u2019t really dig into a lot of female artists until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, Robert Plant was more of an influence on me. When I started to discover women in music it was Tina Turner initially. And Bonnie Raitt is huge. I just love the tenderness in her voice, which she can also turn into a real raspy growl.\u201d The Mandevilles is the latest incarnation of Pryne and Lesyk\u2019s musical merger, which began around the turn of the millennium in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario. After playing in cover bands separately and then together, the duo started penning their own material and formed the hard rock outfit Oliver Black. Soon thereafter they were courted by an American record label that soon went bankrupt, leaving the band at loose ends, and living in the United States. After moving to Europe for a short time, the band released an album under the name Serena Pryne and The Mandevilles which saw them begin an ongoing songwriting collaboration with Nashville-based Niagara Falls transplant Dave \u201cDwave\u201d Thomson. But with a revolving door of musicians and a yearning for something fresh, Lesyk and Pryne decided to return to Canada and reboot the band. Only guitarist Taylor Laslo was kept, and long-time friend Brett Bendo was brought in to play drums a couple of month before the band was set to fly to Vancouver to work at Richardson\u2019s The Farm Studios. After auditioning a number of prospective bassists, Waylon Glintz blew his future bandmates away and got the gig \u2013 three weeks before recording was to begin. Alongside Don\u2019t Ask, Windows and Stones features infectious, melodic rock tunes like the lead-off track, Hangovers, which as evidenced by the name, encapsulates the unpleasant result of an evening of overindulging. \u201cWe visit our friend Dave (Thomson) a couple of times a year in Nashville. During one visit he had a massive blow up with his then fianc\u00e9. But then they reconciled and we decided to have a party to celebrate. We bought several litres of rum and drank it all in one night. I think we almost killed him! The next day he didn\u2019t wake up until well into the evening and he looked like death. When he woke up we wrote the song in about 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Lesyk with a hearty laugh. A more blues-rock fueled version of the traditional country break-up song is I Stole Your Band. \u201cI was working as a seamstress and I was bored one day and kept singing this line \u2018I stole your band when you broke my heart. It was just one of those funny little anecdotes where I\u2019m saying to a fictional boyfriend \u2018if you do something stupid, I\u2019m going to steal your f***ing band,\u201d said Pryne. While The One was another defining moment for the Mandevilles as it was a song that truly brought all five members into the creative process. \u201cWhen we were in pre-production we had a magical moment which I never would have expected. It was in a completely different style when we first brought it to GGGarth, just a happy little folk song. He said it was good but didn\u2019t really go anywhere,\u201d Pryne explained. \u201cWe said let\u2019s take five minutes and work on it a bit. All of a sudden we just started playing and all five of us together created this whole new song. It was one of those inexplicable crazy moments. It\u2019s kind of a heavy song about death, but ambiguous as to what has died \u2013 a person, an idea, a dream a relationship \u2013 it means different things to different people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all us on this record. There are very few tricks, no Auto-tuning of the vocals, and we\u2019re all playing real instruments on every track,\u201d said Pryne. With this remarkable, well-crafted album that manages to be tight in its musicianship but loose in its vibe, The Mandevilles have taken one giant, definitive leap for rock and roll.

Whether it was rocking out to Bruce Springsteen in his dad\u2019s car or singing along to Garth Brooks with his mom, music always played a big part in Chris\u2019 life. Fast forward a few years and, like most kids, Chris couldn\u2019t stand to listen to the same music as his parents. Being from St. Louis he had to know every word to Nelly\u2019s \u201cCountry Grammer\u201d, he also fell in love with artists such as Usher and Fall Out Boy. His mix of pop, rock and country separates him from most other artists out there. After graduating from Ole Miss and spending a few summers traveling back and forth from Oxford to Nashville, Chris decided it was time to make the move. Initially knowing only a few people in the Music City, his drive and determination were quickly noticed throughout town.\n\nFrom almost empty bar rooms to fraternity parties to sold out shows, Chris has been captivating audiences everywhere he goes. Having opened for bands like The Marshall Tucker Band and LoCash, Chris\u2019 stage presence and voice pull the audience in until they are all on their feet! Recently teaming up with United Talent Agency, Chris has been on the road touring all over the midwest and southeast regions.\n\nSo keep an eye out for when Chris will be playing near you. You won\u2019t want to miss one of Nashville\u2019s \u201cRising Country Stars\u201d!", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Chucky Hugh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9165400.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Pop Rock, Rock, Pop, Emo-pop", "Time": "1:30 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "\"SINNER\" Available now on all streaming platforms!: https://chuckyhugh.hearnow.com\n\nChucky Hugh was born and raised in Northern NJ, USA (near NYC), and was musically inclined from a very young age.\n\nHe always preferred theatrical hard rock/ punk music, and even formed bands in school.

With his vocal range of seven plus octaves, ability to swing from a deep guttural baritone to soaring soprano riffs, knack for capturing life through lyrics, and commanding stage presence, he has carved a niche for himself in today\u2019s music world. A prolific songwriter, he has a large and varied catalog of songs ranging from heart-wrenching acoustic ballads to heart-pounding heavier rock. His music is published by EMI Music Publishing Canada (2004-present). Lukas first ventured onto the music scene with two Canadian bands, Cleavage (1995-2005) and Rise Electric (2005-2006), which helped prepare him for what was to come. He entered and won the competition television show Rock Star: Supernova (2006) which earned him front man status with Tommy Lee (Motley Crue), Jason Newsted (Metallica), and Gilby Clark (Guns N' Roses). Their band Rock Star Supernova completed an album and a world tour of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the tour, Lukas returned to Los Angeles and began writing and recording new music. The Love and Lust EP (June 2007) was released and he completed the solo acoustic Love and Lust Tour, making over two dozen stops throughout the United States and Canada. The new material was well-received by fans, and the band Stars Down was born (2008-present). After touring with his new band, Lukas began playing local gigs at such southern California hot spots as The Roxy, The Key Club, The Mint, and Viper Room. The year 2010 kicked off with a mini East Coast tour and Lukas working on his first full length album. Hollywood was released (July 2010) and debuted live at West Hollywood\u2019s famous Viper Room. The all acoustic Hollywood Stripped followed (August 2010). After moving to Nashville, in addition to local and out-of-town gigs, he wrote, recorded, produced, and released six additional recordings. The first three were Seed EP (December 2010), Story Teller (January 2011), and Super, Sex, Magic (February 2011). He also co-wrote, provided vocals, and recorded several music videos for a side-project, Switchblade Glory (April 2011). Lukas released Prophecy (November 2011) and Christmas Collection (December 2011) to complete a very busy year. But he wasn\u2019t finished, releasing the album 8 Days (April 2012) soon after. Lukas has appeared on many media outlets, including performing live at the 2006 Gemini awards, the CBS television series Rock Star: Supernova (18 million viewers worldwide), Ellen, Regis & Kelly, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Entertainment Tonight, The Howard Stern Show, and ET Canada. In addition to his vocal talent, Lukas plays multiple instruments, is a songwriter, producer, actor, and vocal instructor. He currently resides with his wife Kendra in Nashville, Tennessee.

The blistering guitarist, soulful vocalist, singular songwriter and city bus driver fuses his muscular, rock-inspired blues guitar playing with his original, keenly detailed slice-of-life songs, blazing his own blues trail. With the 2016 release of his Alligator Records debut, The Chicago Way, Cannon burst onto the international stage as one the most electrifying bluesmen to emerge from Chicago in decades. His live performances unfailingly earn him heaps of critical praise and hordes of wildly enthusiastic fans. Cannon has played major cities all over the U.S., Canada, and Europe. He recently performed for the first time in Japan, delighting and surprising audiences with one unforgettable gig after another. Now, with the release of The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Cannon builds upon the foundation he\u2019s laid, creating and defining his vision of contemporary blues.\n\nThe Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp features twelve Cannon originals, ranging from the burning social commentary of the title track to the wryly told, up-to-the-minute truths of Insurance to the trademark Cannon humor of Stop Me When I\u2019m Lying and Ordinary Woman. He gets serious on the haunting The First 24, the Martin Luther King-inspired The Silence Of My Friends and on the moving final track, I\u2019m Not Scared. Cannon\u2019s blazing guitar and soul-baring vocals are front and center. His songwriting is inspired by his deep Chicago roots, the wisdom of his grandparents and his years of observing the public while driving a bus. His songs tell timeless stories of common experiences in uncommon ways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the solos,\u201d Cannon says, \u201cIt\u2019s about the songs. People get used to everyday life, so it\u2019s easy to miss the things around them. I write about those things. I know the problems of Chicago, the hardship, 'cause we\u2019re always a scapegoat. But I choose to love and respect the city because of the Chicago blues giants that came here from down south. I\u2019m proud to be standing on the shoulders of every great Chicago blues musician who came before me.\u201d\n\nToronzo Cannon was born in the Windy City on February 14, 1968, and grew up in the shadows of the notoriously tough Robert Taylor Homes. Theresa\u2019s Lounge, one of the city\u2019s most famous South Side blues clubs, was nearby. As a child, Cannon would stand on the sidewalk outside the door, soaking up the live blues pouring out while trying to sneak a glance inside at larger-than-life bluesmen like Junior Wells and Buddy Guy. He also heard plenty of blues growing up in his grandfather\u2019s home, and listened to soul, R&B and contemporary rock on the radio.\n\nCannon bought his first guitar at age 22, and his natural talent enabled him to quickly master the instrument. Although his initial focus was reggae, he found himself increasingly drawn to the blues. \u201cIt was dormant in me. But when I started playing the blues, I found my voice and the blues came pouring out.\u201d He absorbed sounds, styles and licks from Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Hound Dog Taylor, B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Jimi Hendrix, J.B. Hutto, Lil\u2019 Ed and others. Although influenced by many, Cannon\u2019s biting, stinging guitar sound is all his own.\n\nCannon began his rise in the intensely competitive proving ground of the local club scene, where only the best musicians reach the top. Iconic blues artists from Muddy Waters to Howlin\u2019 Wolf to Koko Taylor to Hound Dog Taylor to Luther Allison all paid their dues in the Chicago blues bars before making their mark on the world. The same holds true today, as newcomers look to living legends like Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson and Lil\u2019 Ed Williams for inspiration in taking their music from Chicago to fans across the globe.\n\nFrom 1996 through 2002, Cannon played as a sideman for Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks and Joanna Connor. But he was determined to prove himself. In 2001, while continuing to work as a hired-gun guitarist, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express. By 2003, he was working exclusively as a band leader. Cannon\u2019s first three albums\u20142007\u2019s My Woman (self-released), 2011\u2019s Leaving Mood (Delmark) and 2013\u2019s Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (Delmark)\u2014document his rise from promising up-and-comer to star-in-the-making.\n\nAlmost immediately upon the release of The Chicago Way, Chicago media helped launch Cannon toward blues stardom. He was the subject of multiple newspaper and magazine feature stories and appeared on every local television station. National and international media soon took notice. CNN filmed Cannon leading a tour of Chicago blues clubs and then broadcast the piece around the world. England\u2019s MOJO magazine declared The Chicago Way the #1 Blues Album Of 2016, as did the readers of Living Blues magazine in their annual poll. The album and Cannon were also nominated for four Blues Music Awards (the Grammy of the blues) in 2017. And the world champion Chicago Cubs invited Cannon to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the September 13, 2017 game. All the attention only makes Cannon more focused. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become an ambassador for Chicago blues. People expect a lot from me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s good, because I\u2019m forced to keep upping my game.\u201d\n\nCannon has played the Chicago Blues Festival on ten separate occasions, initially as a sideman, then as a special guest, a sidestage band leader and finally as a main stage headliner. When he\u2019s home, he drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus by day and performs by night. Using every vacation day and day off and working four ten-hour shifts a week, Cannon arranges his schedule to gig out of town as much as possible. It isn\u2019t easy, but, like all of the Chicago greats who have come before him, blues is his calling. Blues Music Magazine declares, \u201cHis guitar playing has all the fire and spontaneity of the Chicago legends he carries; his songwriting is a timely and original look at the world he sees by day on a bus and in blues clubs by night, and his assertive voice is the perfect vehicle to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp, Toronzo Cannon delivers his messages loud and clear. Between his searing chops, soul-satisfying vocals and vibrant and distinctive original songs, Cannon has grown from being a local attraction to become a world-renowned torch bearer for the blues. PBS Television\u2019s Chicago Tonight sums it up like this: \u201cCannon is just your typical CTA bus driver who moonlights as a sought-after Chicago blues musician. As a guitarist, singer and songwriter, he drives the sound of Chicago blues from the city to blues clubs and festivals around the world.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CantStopTheBlues"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Patrick B Ray ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9487702.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Americana, Red Dirt, Folk, Bluegrass, Country, Outlaw Country, Honky Tonk, Western Swing", "Time": "2:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Born in Abilene and raised in Odessa and Austin, country music is in Patrick's blood.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010, he played lead guitar in the Chris Brazeal Band, a Texas Country outfit in Odessa, Texas, before taking time away from gigging to focus on completing his Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nPatrick continued to gig following graduation with the Texas Treetop Flyers, a Classic Rock/Country and Red Dirt band, on rhythm guitar and lead/backing vocals, until he moved to California in 2014.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Patrick played with Patch and Rita, a Country/Folk duo on rhythm guitar and lead/backing vocals.\n\nDuring his time in California, he also played upright bass and mandolin with the Edgewood Mountain Boys, a Bluegrass and Classic Country outfit from West Union, California.\n\nCurrently, he is completing his MBA at Rice University Jones Graduate School of Business in Houston, Texas, with a focus on entrepreneurship.

The band formed at music college in the spring of 2017 Sophie (vocals and guitar), Chris Hill (drums), Bailey Stapledon (bass) and Toby Holmes (guitar), moving to their adopted hometown of Sheffield shortly afterwards; more recently they\u2019ve been taking their intense, life-affirming and rapidly expanding set of songs on tour with the likes of Tom Grennan, Yonaka and Reverend and The Makers.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all is pop\u2019s most captivating new frontperson, whose teenage life is chronicled with unflinching honesty on Sophie & The Giants\u2019 debut EP Adolescence. It\u2019s a collection whose candid songs include Waste My Air, which Sophie wrote last year about the end of a toxic relationship.\n\u201cI was blinded by love for a long time, and put up with shit for a long time, and I realised I\u2019d wasted a lot of my own time,\u201d she explains \u2014 and to make matters more complicated her boyfriend at the time had also been Sophie & The Giants\u2019 first guitarist, as well as Sophie\u2019s flatmate.\n\u201cI had an epiphany, packed my stuff and was out the same day,\u201d Sophie recalls. \u201cI knew I needed to stop people walking over me and making me feel like shit. In that moment, I was the strongest I\u2019d ever felt. Waste My Air is about how I felt once I was out of that relationship.\u201d The theme of growing up and finding yourself is strong throughout Adolescence, an EP brimming with courage and confidence.\n\u201cWhen I was younger I felt like everyone and everything was against me,\u201d Sophie adds today. \u201cThey weren't, and as I got older I realised I\u2019d been creating monsters in my own head. The song is saying, look, you don't have to fight everyone and everything. Not everyone is against you the whole time.\u201d\n\nSophie\u2019s frank lyrics may well strike a note with anyone experiencing difficulties in their own lives, but they\u2019re also Sophie singing to her younger self. She describes herself as having been an anxious child, with confidence issues not helped by persistent bullying she received at school for the crime of having red hair. It went on for years. Looking back, it\u2019s easy to see exactly how and why that unhappiness at school impacted on Sophie\u2019s life at home, where she\u2019d continuously pick fights with her parents, but back then Sophie was just cast as difficult, or stubborn. Sophie joined a choir after school \u2014 a move that led to the unusual mid-teens experience of performing at Wembley Arena \u2014 which fulfilled its intended purpose and provided a confidence boost. But it had been songwriting in the privacy of her bedroom, and in an occasionally deserted school music room, that proved to be Sophie\u2019s salvation.\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when there weren\u2019t melodies in my head,\u201d she notes. \u201cWhen I started writing lyrics and playing the guitar, suddenly it wasn't all in my head any more.\u201d\n\nAll of which meant that at 18 she left the mean streets of Staines and headed to music college in Guildford, Surrey, which is where Sophie met her Giants. In the band\u2019s earliest incarnation Sophie was accompanied by musicians who were all, for some reason, extraordinarily tall.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re just average height,\u201d admits Chris, who joined Sophie having previously been in what he describes as \u201ca pretentious math rock band\u201d. Bailey was next to join \u2014 he\u2019d been a fan of the band\u2019s earliest lineup. \u201cThen one day,\u201d Bailey remembers, \u201cChris and I were having a meeting in Sophie's room, and just as we decided Toby should be our new guitarist he walked past the window, which was good timing.\u201d All members faced their own challenges at music college, from the defeatist attitude of tutors who prepared musicians for life as session artists, to the singers who just wanted to be models. Sophie, once again, felt excluded from all this, but was not prepared to let history repeat itself.\n\u201cAt college you have all these little cliques,\u201d Chris says. \u201cSophie wasn\u2019t in them \u2014 and I saw that give her strength. It completely changed her. She came out stronger.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 2017 the band had only been together eight weeks but finished college and took a leap into the unknown, moving as one to their adopted home of Sheffield, with Sophie having fallen in love with the city after a visit to work with Reverend & The Makers frontman Jon McClure, who subsequently became an unofficial mentor to the band. Toby, who\u2019d only been in the band two months, hadn\u2019t even visited Sheffield before he dumped his bags down in the house the band would share together. \u201cI had faith,\u201d Toby remembers. \u201cMore importantly, I didn't want to live apart from the rest of the band. I didn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s house on a suburban street two miles west of the city centre was a shambles: running water \u2014 thanks to a leaking ceiling \u2014 but taps that didn\u2019t work. Chris\u2019 bedroom, which was actually the lounge, didn\u2019t have a door, unless you counted the front door; the back door, which became the front door, had a broken handle. It was hard to forget the house was on a hill because the floors sloped, meaning that when Chris was working in the upstairs studio he\u2019d gradually slide from one end of the desk to the other. Slightly awful, then, but perfect at the same time.\n\u201cBy living together we figured out who we are not just as individuals but as a unit,\u201d Sophie adds. \u201cWe've learned a lot in the last year, but above all we\u2019ve learned what it actually means to be a band.\u201d\n\nListeners won\u2019t need to move to Sheffield to find that out for themselves: the Adolescence EP is a brilliantly focused first release by one of Britain\u2019s most exciting new groups. While Sophie continues to toy with justifying her band\u2019s name by putting Bailey, Chris and Toby in heels, the empowering nature of her lyrics means that the \u2018giants\u2019 concept has taken on a new meaning: this is music that\u2019s all about standing tall. It\u2019s about owning who you are, Sophie suggests.\n\u201cWe want people to come together because of our music,\u201d Chris adds. \u201cThe important thing is that you need to be yourself.\u201d Adds Bailey: \u201cLife\u2019s full of cliques but our theory is: fuck all that, here's some music.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe'd love to be a pop band that makes a difference by making music human again,\u201d Sophie adds.\u201cEvery song I've written is from an experiences I've had; human mistakes that I've made and lived through.\u201d\nStone Cold, for instance, is all about Sophie\u2019s idiosyncratic take on love: \u201cSongs from female singers are so often about unrequited love, but for me a lot of the time it's the other way round: it\u2019s upsetting not being able to feel the way they want you to, because you're so focused on other things. You feel like a stone cold bitch.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s Space Girl, in which Sophie debates\n\u201cspending your whole childhood aspiring to be something, then when it starts happening you begin to wonder if you can handle it, and what you really want\u201d.\nBut the Adolescence EP is not about wallowing, or resting on laurels, and it\u2019s certainly not about admitting defeat. It\u2019s about coming out fighting. The spiky fury of Bulldog, which documents the time a friend of the band was assaulted by their partner, is proof of that.\n\nNone of the band\u2019s single or EP releases are disconnected. They\u2019re all chapters of the same story. And there\u2019s a key line in the band\u2019s earlier song Monsters \u2014 \u201cthe future beckons you\u201d \u2014 that brilliantly sums up the band\u2019s ideology.\n\u201cSomething can feel really shit at the time, whether it\u2019s when you\u2019re growing up, or when you first come out of a relationship, and there's this sense of impending doom,\u201d Sophie explains. \u201cBut in the back of your mind, you know that in a couple of months' time you won't give a shit. Things will get better; everything passes. The future is pulling you forward. And when you get older, you'll be a little bit wiser.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all about moving forward, and of course Sophie & The Giants\u2019 rapidly swelling fanbase, the honorary giants who over the last year have fallen in love with the band at their support slots, festival dates and headline shows, are coming along for the ride too.\n\u201cIt's time for music to be born again,\u201d is how Bailey sees it. \u201cIt\u2019s not about looking at people on stage and thinking, \u2018I wish I could do that\u2019. It's about looking at people on stage and deciding, \u2018I'm going to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nSeptember 2018", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "LITE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10396667.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Math Rock, Post Rock, Rock", "Time": "11:00 AM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "LITE is a Japanese instrumental rock band known for thrilling and emotional compositions, progressive, edgy riffs and complex rhythms.\nWidely regarded for their explosive live show and tireless touring in the US, Europe and Asia, LITE are one of the most exciting bands to emerge from Japan in the last decade.\nEntering their 16th year together, LITE boasts a tremendous back catalog of five full-length albums and six EPs, released through their own label and the American label Topshelf Records.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pete Tong ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8664091.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "PETE TONG is Britain's best-loved dance DJ. He doesn't need an award to prove his popularity and he won't act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1's ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground.\n\nBorn in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time...by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn \"Champagne\" King) Pete's first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and - as part of the Kent 'Soul Mafia' - playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system.\n\nIn 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until '83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute 'magazine' feature on dance music on Peter Powell's show. \"That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,\" says Pete. \"Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals on the radio.\"\n\nPete's knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in '83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like '80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn't pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent's newly-launched Invicta station in '84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers.\n\nIn '88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. \"The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,\" he recalls. \"I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books.\"\n\nInevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR's next releases were cut'n'paste production 'Bass (How Low Can You Go?)' by Simon Harris and Salt'n'Pepa's 'Push It', both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve 'Silk' Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L'il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie.\n\nIn '91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country's best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. \"I'm not too concerned with credibility,\" he claims. \"When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn't see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn't want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one.\"\n\nPerhaps Pete's biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation's biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-'90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete's ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1's DJ roster. In addition, the station's daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January '99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK's most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host's consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest - which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you're lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox - comes complete with Madonna's seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation.\n\nDuring '98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine's annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won't be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1's high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops.\n\nIn the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister's hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in '92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach.\n\nThe year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete - he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1's 'Love Parade' - \"standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever - a real moment in history\".\n\n2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year.\n\nKeeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments.

He doesn't need an award to prove his popularity and he won't act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1's ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground.\n\nBorn in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time...by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn \"Champagne\" King) Pete's first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and - as part of the Kent 'Soul Mafia' - playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system.\n\nIn 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until '83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute 'magazine' feature on dance music on Peter Powell's show. \"That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,\" says Pete. \"Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals on the radio.\"\n\nPete's knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in '83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like '80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn't pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent's newly-launched Invicta station in '84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers.\n\nIn '88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. \"The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,\" he recalls. \"I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books.\"\n\nInevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR's next releases were cut'n'paste production 'Bass (How Low Can You Go?)' by Simon Harris and Salt'n'Pepa's 'Push It', both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve 'Silk' Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L'il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie.\n\nIn '91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country's best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. \"I'm not too concerned with credibility,\" he claims. \"When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn't see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn't want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one.\"\n\nPerhaps Pete's biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1.

With the prolific duo\u2019s meteoric rise a true testament to their hard work in the studio and infectious energy in the club, a slew of early releases via imprints such as Viva, and elrow helped rocket the pair to their first Beatport Number #1 with their breakthrough record on Hot Creations, \u2018Tribesmen\u2019.\n\nHaving later released EPs on Toolroom Records, Lee Foss\u2019 Repopulate Mars and Green Velvet\u2019s Relief Records, Solardo soon branched out into their now iconic Sola imprint - which soon became a home for a flurry of the most predominant tech-house tracks on the circuit. With over 50 releases on the label with tracks from the likes of Max Chapman, Mason Maynard, and Grammy nominated duo CamelPhat - who Mark & James worked with on collaborative club track \u2018Accelerator\u2019, the label has gone from strength to strength hosting parties at the BPM Festival, The Warehouse Project and its own club showcase at The Source in Maidstone.\n\nAfter being assigned remixes for the likes of MK, David Guetta, Black Coffee, Nicole Moudaber & Carl Cox, Solardo\u2019s success hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and they signed to Ultra Music. Since then, the pair have gone onto release hits \u2018Be Somebody\u2019, \u2018Tango Wango\u2019 and their latest release \u2018XTC\u2019. Arguably the duo\u2019s most successful release to date, the track has been an anthem for them and many DJ\u2019s alike with it being hailed as one of the tracks of the summer in Ibiza. So much so, BBC Radio 1 used it to promote all of their big weekend in Ibiza adverts - where Mark & James also played - whilst it was championed by Annie Mac (Hottest Record In The World), Pete Tong, Danny Howard (Friday Fire) & MistaJam (#1 Radio 1 dance charts) across the station. The tracks' success didn\u2019t end there, with it being voted thewinner of \u2018best track of the year\u2019 at the DJ Mag Best of British awards.\n\nThe love didn\u2019t stop there for the lads, towards the end of 2019 they hooked up with legendary producer Marshall Jefferson to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of one of the most iconic house tunes \u2018Move Your Body\u2019. With the lads touch, the track has been reborn into a modern day anthem only proven by it dominating the Beatport charts (the release was No.1 for 46 days which is an all time record!), being added to BBC Radio 1\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 list for three weeks straight and Scott Mills & BBC Radio 1 themselves selecting it for \u2018Tune Of The Weekend\u2019. With support coming from all corners of the globe, the release peaked at #1 in Sweden, #5 in the UK and #27 worldwide in the Spotify viral charts, and was in the top 100 Shazam\u2019s in 5 countries, peaking at #7 in the UK.\n\nMusic aside, the duo\u2019s presence on the road is ever growing. After selling out The Warehouse Project and London\u2019s Studio 338 with their brand new event series HIGHER, the pair took HIGHER on the road with successful stage takeovers at the likes of Higher Vision in Ireland and Mysteryland in Holland, where Eric Morillo, Skream & Groove Armada came and played. Mark & James also found the time to fit in over 30 major festivals throughout the course of 2019 including sets at Glastonbury, Creamfields, Parklife, Holyship, Babylon Festival, Tomorrowland (x2), EDC Las Vegas, We Are FSTVL, Beyond Wonderland, Snowbombing and their first Ultra Music Festival in Miami where they launched collaborative project SoPhat alongside Camelphat.\n\nFollowing on from their Club Solardo residency in the club room at Hi Ibiza last year, the duo launched their brand new record breaking 12 week residency BODYWORKS (again at Hi Ibiza) with themselves and Camelphat hosting the theatre, and FISHER in the club room. During the course of the summer, BODYWORKS broke numerous club records with over 7000+ people through the doors on multiple occasions and an estimated 90,000 passing through over the 12 weeks. With guests including Enzo Siragusa, Heidi, Danny Howard, Mason Maynard and many more, it just goes to show what a force theyhave now become on the island.\n\nThe duo\u2019s own radio show named \u2018The Spot\u2019 continues to go from strength to strength. Fast approaching it\u2019s 100th episode, they have so far had guests such as Claude VonStroke, Nicole Moudaber, Andrea Oliva, Gorgon City, MK, Skream and Kenny Dope all contributing guest mixes for the pair.

He rapidly broke through onto the Garage pirate radio stations and forums gaining instant recognition, and was subsequently snapped up by international promoters to perform tours of Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Russia. Majestic has since crossed into a multitude of dance music genres from UK Garage to House to Drum & Bass and Dubstep performing with leading artists across the scene such as Sigma, DJ EZ, Dream Teem, Agent X, MJ Cole, Judge Jules, Micky Slim, Jack Beats, Laidback Luke, The Wideboys, Netsky, High Contrast, Loadstar, Shy FX, Skream, Bar9, Nero and Jacob Plant to name a few.\n\nAs well as a legendary MC known for being risqu\u00e9 in spreading his word, Majestic is also making waves as an artist in his own right. His single \u201cIn The VIP\u201d written and produced with the Wideboys that took a satirical look at the VIP Club culture, was released on Skint Records. After receiving serious hits on YouTube and Radio Support from MistaJam, DJ Target, Kissy Sell Out and Steve Smart on heavy rotation, the record also made its way onto the MOS Bass Culture annual.\nMajestic\u2019s lyrical flow then caught the eye of American Dubstep superstar Skrillex who sampled Majestics legendary, almost anthemic, \u201cRuffneck Bass\u201d spit for his latest massive single of the same title, played by the worlds biggest DJs and over 50m views online.\n\nAfter signing up to be Dubstep wonderkid, Jacob Plant\u2019s official hype man, the pair released, \u201cMosh Pit\u201d on Speakerbox. Majestic has been in the studio collaborating on a number of cutting edge tracks they intend to PA live at their shows. They have already performed for massive student brand Under The Radar on their tour dates up and down the country, as well as for Fresher\u2019s events at all the leading Universities in the UK. Plus having just wowed the crowd at Brighton\u2019s Shakedown festival performing on the main stage in front of 8000 revellers, in-between Razorlight and Example, they are certainly heading for superstar status!\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder Majestic is in demand to perform Live, with Mistajam quoting Majestic as being the \u201cbest live MC in the game\u201d after requesting him to perform alongside him at Exit festival in Serbia and Eddie Temple Morris bringing him onboard The Big Reunion Shows this winter not to mention continuing tours with The Wideboys, the hype has only just begun. After an amazing summer in 2012, opening up the main stage with Micky Slim at Global Gathering and his BCM Magaluf residency with Speakerbox, Majestic then signed to Mistajam\u2019s 360 label and management set up.\n\nMajestic then released the free giveaway \u201cLet\u2019s Go Back\u201d EP via Speakerbox with remixes from The Wideboys, DJ Q, Cause N Affect and LKiD, with the original track produced by Micky Slim and accompanied by an outstanding blast from the past video, filmed and edited by Naked Jake, about the days of \u2018shirts and shoes\u2019 and a time where you could spark up a cigarette whilst skanking out to MC Creed and Matt Jam Lamont.\n\nIn 2013, Majestic became a Top 40 featured artist as the voice of Droideka\u2019s \u201cGet Hyper\u201d which took an unexpected viral bounce up the charts after initially being released as a video on YouTube in July 2011. The track was featured as one of Spotify\u2019s \u201cTop 10 Most Viral Tracks\u201d list in January 2013 after a viral video rally from the KSI team which could lay claim to the inspiration behind the Harlem Shake viral epidemic of Baauer\u2019s Trap phenomenon.\n\nMajestic is not only a veteran mic man who tears down every stage he touches, Majestic is a producer and a DJ in his own right; His single, \u201cCreeping in the Dark\u201d with Public Demand\u2019s Jungle70, was signed to Capitol Records (Sam Smith, 5SOS, Jennifer Lopez) and has had huge support from Pete Tong, Zane Lowe, Nick Grimshaw and Sara Cox to name a few as well as Club support from the likes of Solomun and Richie Hawtin.\n\nSummer 2014 saw Majestic perform his first full tour with over 40 dates across the EU. With Speakerbox stages for WE R FSTVL, EDC, Creamfields and Boardmasters whilst flying across the holiday isles of Mallorca, Malia, Zante and Kavos all kicked off by a one off US date with Laidback Luke performing their single \u201cPOGO\u201d at Ultra Music Festival Miami to over 10k people.\n\nMajestic was then asked by Kiss FM for a show on their new Kiss Fresh station, 3 months in he was offered the prime time Saturday 6-8 on the main station. DJ EZ then left the station and there was no other man fit to replace him but Majestic who has now transformed Thursday nights 9-12 into the epicentre of House, Garage and Grime. Majestic\u2019s addition to the two shows have helped Kiss FM UK to become the biggest radio station in London again.\n\nSummer 2015 is set to be even bigger, with his new residency for \u2019Sounds of the Future\u2019 at BCM and also the brand new BH Hotel in Mallorca alongside his 40+ dates across Spain and Greece. Majestic is also opening for the Prodigy as part of his festival looks with Kiss FM UK.\n\nSo with the Majestic message travelling fast, hyping the crowd into a frenzy, Majestic takes on the role of grand puppeteer, from waiving lighters in the air to chanting back at the DJ, his commands are dutifully followed and quite a sight to behold. Through years of hard graft, quite literally behind the scene, Majestic has studied the sound of the underground for well over a decade. Majestic is realising his destiny as one of the biggest talents to come out of the UK underground scene, infinitely more than just the best live MC in the game.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Franky Wah ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9033966.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Yorkshire Producer / Dj- House and Techno with a chance of Disco\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/frankywahmusic\nhttps://twitter.com/frankywahmusic\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/3IG3Ub4ra8AuSxCFDVkVco?si=1CsOEkySS4KKFeARUW1ZTA\nhttps://soundcloud.com/frankywah\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/franky-wah/1316289895", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Regard ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10061680.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "James HYPE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8120201.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Garage, Bass, & More", "Time": "12:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "James Hype had spent his early career cutting his teeth amongst the club circuits in the North of England.

And that\u2019s exactly what Night Slugs co-founder aka L-Vis 1990 is doing under his Dance System guise.\u201d DUMMY\n\nAt the forefront of dance music for over a decade, L-Vis 1990 has left an indelible mark as a progressive producer; including his alias Dance System.\n\nDance System boils dance music down to its core elements to create infectious club tools with character that will standout in any set. Following releases on Clone and Ultramajic, Dance System took a five-year hiatus and is excited to return with the Wind 'Em Up EP, released on April 12th on Modeselektor\u2019s lauded Monkeytown Records.\n\nIn today\u2019s serious techno world, and against the current political landscape, Dance System is the playful breath of fresh air we all want and need. With influence from Dance Mania and Relief Records, Dance System takes a nod from Chicago, but makes a new sound distinctly his own.\n\nIndeed, on title track Wind Em Up, Dance System is playfully calling out for other DJs to do exactly that; wind up the crowd with the unexpected UK garage breaks that bring colour to the driving beat and guitar lick. Heeez Baaad takes a single hypnotic loop and pushes it to its absolute limit, the only break coming when the track slows down to a halt, before slamming straight back into the action. Bringing in the horns on That That Sh**, the off\u2013kilter horn loop is unsettling, but driven along by the low end tom groove.

Her musical talent was discovered early on and fostered by Helena Guimar\u00e3es Galo and Arnaldo Estrella (student of Alfred Cortot and friend of Villa Lobos), at the Conservatory of Antwerp student of Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge, student of Arthur Schnabel>Leon Fleisher>Jacques De Ti\u00e8ge.\n\nShe played a first recital at the age of 5 in the Teatro Mesbla in Rio de Janeiro. First TV performance at age 6 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Alceo Bocchino with a Haydn concerto, and another two times the same concerto conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho and Isaac Karabtchevsky with the Orquestra Sinfonica Brasileira. At age 7 she performed Mozart KV488 with the Orquestra Sinfonica Nacional conducted by Edouard van Remoortel (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nIn the USA she received the \"special prize\" of the jury at the Van Cliburn competition, and she made an indelible impression with Beethoven\u00b4s piano concerto n.4 at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium.\n\nAfter the \"wonderkind\" and \"competitions\" happenings, she received invitations to perform in more than 25 countries. Her intelligence and brilliant musical feeling allow her to play a repertory of 61 piano concertos.\n\nIn 1990 she took up composing again, producing brilliant and at times mischievous cadenzas for her concertos. In 1994-95 she wrote her 15 Momentos Musicais and composed the Sonate Oubli\u00e9e with themes from her childhood. Her characteristics have remained unchanged: simplicity and spontaneity, feeling and imagination, technique, perfection without affectation, a delight for the eye and ear.\n\nIn February 1998 Rodrigues' Bach-CD was recorded. The critics describe her improvisations and paraphrases on works for the organ as: \"The sonorities go back to the scale of more than 3 centuries of piano literature and link perfectly well up with the richness in colour of an independent way of pianistic thinking, they have their own new life, a fascinating transfiguration, full of phantasy.\"\n\nAstonishment, admiration and even incredibility caused her Suite n.1 \"Rio de Janeiro\" for piano and orchestra, that was first performed on 9 August 2000. She plaid and recorded in St. Petersburg the 5 concerto's for piano from Sergei Prokofiev with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n1998 - 2014 she is invited in a.o. Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels, Den Haag, Lisbon, Moscow, New-York, N\u00fcrnberg, Rotterdam, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOver the last few years Eliane Rodrigues has also won great acclaim as a conductor. She has trained with Herbert Slegers (theory), Alexander Dmitriev, Edward Serov, Dmitri Liss and Juozas Domarkas (practical), Gloria Rodrigues-da Silva, prima ballerina (choreographer/kinematics).\n\nShe can now lead the orchestra to produce great classical compositions as she has already done for example with Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas.\n\nEliane Rodrigues is professor on the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.", "otherInfo": "Come join Eliane at home and listen to various pieces of her vast repertoire!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Georgetown Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10398132.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Hillbilly, Folk, Bluegrass, Country, Blues", "Time": "1:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Blue-Billy-Folk-Pop", "otherInfo": "Georgetown & The Moonies will be streaming live to your couch on 30 May 20(Corona)20"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Harri ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cara Rose ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Roly Mo ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Cara Rose ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Dougie MacLean ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620107.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "International, Celtic", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Dougie MacLean is one of Scotland's finest singer-songwriters, with a very rich, heavily-accented voice.

They were formed in Clydebank, Scotland in 1982. They took their name from the Scritti Politti song, \"Gettin, havin' and holdin'\".\n\nIn 1994 Wet Wet Wet had their biggest hit, with a cover version of the The Troggs single \"Love Is All Around\", which was a huge international success and spent 15 weeks at Number 1 in the British charts. Only Marti Pellow's insistence on deletion (he was bored of its chart domination, and overheard people complaining about it) prevented the song from possibly equalling and breaking, the record for the longest-standing Number 1 single, held by Bryan Adams.\nThe song was used on the soundtrack to the film Four Weddings and a Funeral. In the official UK best-selling singles list issued in 2002, it was placed 11th.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1990s the band maintained a strong UK following, although success in the singles charts became more sporadic. Pellow quit the band and went into rehab to battle a debilitating heroin addiction, while Tommy Cunningham resigned acrimoniously.\nPellow succeeded in kicking his habit, and returned to the public eye in 2001, with a solo album. In 2003, the Pellow and Cunnigham cautiously reformed with Graeme Clark and Neil Mitchell in order to work on a new record, and a single called \"All I Want\" which was released in October 2004.\n\nWet Wet Wet reunited in 2004 for a successful tour in the UK, and released a Greatest Hits album.\n\nIn 2005 Wet Wet Wet played at the Summer Weekender in England, and were one of the headline acts at Live 8 Edinburgh.\n\nWet Wet Wet's latest album Timeless was released in 2007.\n\nFor photographs and additional information visit Wet Wet Wet's official website, www.WetWetWet.co.uk .", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Neon Waltz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8505982.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Join Mailing List:\nhttp://bit.ly/neonwaltzmaillist", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Anchor Lane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8863053.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Heavy Rock", "Time": "2:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Glasgow heavy rock band Anchor Lane have become a regular fixture on the Scottish music scene.

Peddling a kind of jangly guitar pop not dissimilar to their Scottish contemporaries Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, they had three hit singles in the UK, all written by guitarist and founder member Bobby Bluebell (aka Robert Hodgens) - \"I'm Falling\" with Ken McCluskey , \"Cath\", and their biggest success \"Young At Heart\". The latter was co-written with Siobhan Fahey (with whom Hodgens was romantically linked for a while) and made it to No.8 in the UK singles chart on its original release in 1984. The band also released two albums, \"The Bluebells\" and \"Sisters\".\n\nThe band split up in the mid-1980s, but enjoyed an unexpected - albeit brief - revival in 1993 when \"Young At Heart\" was used in a Volkswagen TV commercial. Re-issued as a single, it was No.1 for four weeks and led to the band reforming temporarily to perform the song on Top of the Pops. A singles collection followed.\n\nAt the time of the 1990s revival, band member Lawrence Donegan - who trained as a journalist after the band's demise and is now golfing correspondent for The Guardian - wrote a newspaper article reminiscing about his days as a Bluebell which caused some friction between himself and the rest of the band. Amongst other anecdotes, he claimed that the group took part in a talent contest in Los Angeles in 1984, where a fellow contestant - an up-and-coming singer called Madonna - blew cigarette smoke into the band's faces and declared them to be \"losers\". The other ex-Bluebells are adamant that no such incident took place.

They were later joined by Tony to become Above & Beyond.\n\nAnjunabeats was formed when Jono Grant and Paavo Siljamaki met at Westminster University and discovered a mutual love of electronic music. The pair kicked off the label in 2000 with \u2018Anjunabeats Volume 1\u2019, a massive club success which instantly ear-pricked the likes of Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold and Paul van Dyk. The bomb had dropped and the Anjunabeats name was firmly on the map.\n\nSoon afterwards Jono and Paavo became friends with fellow producer Tony McGuinness and together the three went on to form Above & Beyond. When the Above & Beyond remix of Chakra \u2018Home\u2019 reached number one in the UK club charts, the trio had many of the world\u2019s leading labels knocking at their door, offering some interesting remix opportunities. The most exciting came from Madonna, who invited the boys to give \u2018What It Feels Like For A Girl\u2019 the Above & Beyond treatment.\n\nAs Above & Beyond\u2019s profile as artists grew, so did the Anjunabeats label.

In February 2008, the label achieved the rare milestone of 100 vinyl releases and celebrated with a series of Anjunabeach parties, including a return to the label's roots in Goa. These days Anjunabeats also has a younger sibling in the form of Anjunadeep, a melodic house offshoot whose regular fans include the likes of Sasha, Desyn Masiello and James Zabiela.\n\nMore than just a record label, Anjunabeats has become a global community for like-minded fans of electronic music, and now ranks as one of the most influential forces in dance music today.\n\n\u201cAbove & Beyond's Anjunabeats label is one of the most innovative dance music imprints around\u2026 they have brought through a raft of hot electronic talent, shattering listeners\u2019 pre-conceptions of what trance can be\u201d - DJ Magazine\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember my last set that didn\u2019t have an Above & Beyond production in it.

Y es a ra\u00edz de ello cuando, en noviembre de 2005, estos tres m\u00fasicos fueron invitados, junto a un cuarto cuatrista, Rafael Mart\u00ednez, a participar en un concierto organizado por la Fundaci\u00f3n Multifon\u00eda. All\u00ed, cada uno har\u00eda una muestra de su trabajo como solista, pero espont\u00e1neamente estos m\u00fasicos decidieron hacer d\u00faos, tr\u00edos y un cierre final a cuarteto. Este momento marc\u00f3 la g\u00e9nesis de este ensamble que tiene como figura predominante el cuatro venezolano. De diferentes ciudades de Venezuela, Jorge Glem de Cuman\u00e1, H\u00e9ctor Molina de M\u00e9rida y Edward Ram\u00edrez de Caracas, convergieron en la capital venezolana para dar forma a una de las propuestas musicales m\u00e1s importantes de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. En el a\u00f1o 2006, la agrupaci\u00f3n asume definitivamente el nombre de C4 Tr\u00edo, gracias a la grabaci\u00f3n de su primera producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica que estuvo bajo la producci\u00f3n musical de Aquiles B\u00e1ez y que cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de un nutrido grupo de m\u00fasicos venezolanos, como Serenata Guayanesa, Rafael \"el Pollo\" Brito, Marina Bravo, Zeneida Rodr\u00edguez, Adolfo Herrera, Roberto Koch, Edwin Arellano y el propio Aquiles B\u00e1ez. R\u00e1pidamente, el disco compacto se convirti\u00f3 en una referencia de la m\u00fasica en Venezuela y en poco tiempo pas\u00f3 a ser doble Disco de Oro por el n\u00famero de copias vendidas. Esta producci\u00f3n dispar\u00f3 la popularidad de C4 Tr\u00edo, permiti\u00e9ndoles tener una intensa actividad en las m\u00e1s prestigiosas salas de Venezuela y una fuerte agenda internacional que los ha llevado, en dos ediciones \u20132005 y 2006\u2013, al Festival Venezuelan Sounds, organizado por la Embajada de Venezuela en Estados Unidos, que incluy\u00f3 conciertos en el Bol\u00edvar Hall de Washington, Smithsonian Institution Building, The Castle y Kennedy Center; en 2007, a Inglaterra al Salisbury Intertantional Art Festival 2007 y Bol\u00edvar Hall de Londres; en 2008, al Sal\u00f3n Azul de la Intendencia de Montevideo-Uruguay y al Mercado Cultural de Bah\u00eda 2008, en Brasil. As\u00ed mismo, ha compartido escena con un nutrido n\u00famero de artistas nacionales e internacionales, entre los que cabe destacar a Jorge Drexler, Soledad Bravo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Rafael \u201cel Pollo\u201d Brito, El Cuarteto, Edmar Casta\u00f1eda, Eddy Marcano, Juan Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Cheo Hurtado, Gonzalo Teppa, entre otros. En 2009, C4 lanza al mercado su segunda producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, Entre manos, que viene acompa\u00f1ada, adem\u00e1s, de un DVD donde el grupo muestra su desempe\u00f1o en un concierto en vivo. Entre manos muestra una faceta mucho m\u00e1s madura de la agrupaci\u00f3n, incluye composiciones de sus integrantes y las participaciones como invitados de Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Yonathan Gavidia, Jorge Torres, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado y Rodner Padilla quien, desde este mismo a\u00f1o, comienza a formar parte definitiva de C4 como bajista, lo que ha enriquecido a\u00fan m\u00e1s la propuesta musical de la agrupaci\u00f3n, caracterizada por abordar un repertorio no tan com\u00fan para el cuatro, con el que se explota un sinf\u00edn de recursos sonoros, agregando a sus interpretaciones un porcentaje importante de improvisaci\u00f3n. C4 es miembro fundador del colectivo de ensambles de m\u00fasica popular venezolana Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana con quienes grabaron, en 2009, un CD en vivo que recoge el trabajo de las seis agrupaciones que lo conforman. Asimismo, est\u00e1 previsto para el 2010 el lanzamiento de el DVD MAU en vivo, grabado en septiembre de 2009 en el Aula Magna de la Universidad Central de Venezuela. En el 2013, unen talentos con el ic\u00f3nico cantante venezolano Gualberto Ibarreto en un disco titulado \"Gualberto + C4\", que fue nominado al Latin Grammy 2013 y los hizo acreedores de 3 premios Pepsi Music. Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde, grabaron el CD \"De Repente\" junto a Rafael \"Pollo\" Brito, con el que realizaron una exitosa gira nacional y ganaron un Latin Grammy y siete premios Pepsi Music. En el a\u00f1o 2015, iniciaron la grabaci\u00f3n de un DVD como celebraci\u00f3n de una d\u00e9cada de trabajo art\u00edstico junto a grandes figuras de la m\u00fasica como Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Rafael Pollo Brito, Guaco, Desorden P\u00fablico, Servando Primera, Oscar D' Le\u00f3n, Francisco Pacheco, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado, Betsayda Machado. Ese mismo a\u00f1o celebraron su primera d\u00e9cada con un concierto a sala llena en el Teatro Teresa Carre\u00f1o. Actualmente trabajan en la producci\u00f3n de un dicos junto a la banda de ska Desorden P\u00fablico y planean llevar su sonido a varias ciudades de Europa. The origins of C4 Tr\u00edo is directly connected with the international competition \u201cLa Siembra del Cuatro\u201d, created by Professor Cheo Hurtado, in which Jorge Glem, H\u00e9ctor Molina and Edward Ram\u00edrez had excellent performances as cuatristas in 2004 and 2005. For this reason, in November 2005, these three musicians were invited, along with a fourth cuatrista, Rafael Mart\u00ednez, to participate in a concert coordinated by Multifon\u00eda Foundation. During this concert, each one of them would show their skills performing solos in cuatro, but then, these musicians decided spontaneously to perform making duos, then trios, and finally a quartet for the closure of the concert. That specific moment caused a strong effect on the genesis of this ensemble having the Venezuelan cuatro as the main instrument. Coming from different Venezuelan cities, Jorge Glem from Cuman\u00e1, H\u00e9ctor Molina from M\u00e9rida and Edward Ram\u00edrez from Caracas, they converged in the Venezuelan capital to shape up one of the most important music proposal of the last years. In 2006, the group assumed definitely the name C4 Tr\u00edo after the recording of their first self-titled album under the music production of Aquiles B\u00e1ez, having also the participation of many national important groups and musicians such as Serenata Guayanesa, Rafael \"el Pollo\" Brito, Marina Bravo, Zeneida Rodr\u00edguez, Adolfo Herrera, Roberto Koch, Edwin Arellano and Aquiles B\u00e1ez him-self. In just a few weeks, the album became a music reference in Venezuela, reaching a double Golden Record because of the number of sold out copies. This discography production trigged C4 Tr\u00edo\u2019s popularity, making possible to have an intense artistic activity on the most prestigious Venezuelan stages and a great international agenda, taking them twice to the Venezuelan Sounds Festival (2006, 2007) coordinated by the Embassy of Venezuela in the United States, including concerts in the Bol\u00edvar Hall of Washington, Smithsonian Institution Building, The Castle and in the Kennedy Center. In England, the trio participated at the Salisbury International Art Festival 2007 and performed at the Bolivar Hall in London. In 2008, they performed at the Salon Azul de la Independencia (Blue Hall of Independence) in Montevideo, Uruguay and in the Mercado Cultural de Bahia (Cultural Market of Bahia) in Brazil. They had also shared stage with a significant number of national and international important artists like Jorge Drexler, Soledad Bravo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Rafael \u201cel Pollo\u201d Brito, El Cuarteto, Edmar Casta\u00f1eda, Eddy Marcano, Juan Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Aquiles B\u00e1ez, Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Cheo Hurtado, Gonzalo Teppa, among others. In 2009, C4 Tr\u00edo released a second album Entre Manos (Among Hands), including a CD plus a live DVD, exposing the skills of these three talented musicians onstage. Entre manos illustrates a new feature much more mature of the group with compositions of all the integrants and also having participations of some important guests like Alexis C\u00e1rdenas, Yonathan Gavidia, Jorge Torres, Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Delgado and Rodner Padilla, who since 2009 joined definitively C4 Tr\u00edo as a bassist, enriching even more the music proposal of the group characterized by tackling a uncommon repertoire for cuatro, exploding a countless number of sound resources and adding also to the performances a large improvisation percentage. C4 Tr\u00edo is a founder member of the collective project Movida Ac\u00fastica Urbana, MAU (Urban Acoustic Gathering) with whom they recorded in 2009 a live album along with the work of other five Venezuelan groups. The MAU will release the DVD version in 2010 recorded in September 2009 at the Aula Magna of the Central University of Venezuela. In 2013 , they joined forces with the iconic Venezuelan singer Gualberto Ibarreto on a CD entitled \" Gualberto + C4 \" which was nominated for a Latin Grammy 2013 and won 3 Pepsi Music Awards . A year later , they recorded the CD \" De Repente \" with Rafael \"Pollo\" Brito , with which they held a successful national tour and won a Latin Grammy Award and seven Pepsi Music Awards. In 2015 , they began recording a DVD as a celebration of a decade of artistic work with great musical figures as Aquiles B\u00e1ez , Rafael Pollo Brito, Guaco , Desorden P\u00fablico, Servando Primera, Oscar D'Leon , Francisco Pacheco, Jose Alejandro Delgado, Betsayda Machado. That same year they celebrated their first decade with a concert to a full house at the Teresa Carreno Theater. Currently they are working in the production of a CD with the band of ska Desorden P\u00fablico and plan to take their sound to several cities in Europe. @c4trio / www.c4trio.com / c4trio@gmail.com", "otherInfo": "Desde hace tiempo hemos estado trabajando en una serie de Masterclasses para ustedes, en ese espacio nos adentramos en la m\u00fasica de C4 Tr\u00edo.\n\nNo solo invitamos a los cuatristas y bajistas sino a todo aquel (m\u00fasico y no m\u00fasico) que est\u00e9 curioso e interesado en nuestra manera de abordar la m\u00fasica.\n\nTodos estan bienvenidos y los esperamos!\n\nLa primera masterclass de la serie ser\u00e1 :\n\nLa Percusi\u00f3n Desde el Cuatro en C4 Tri\u00f3 con Jorge Glem, que tomara lugar el s\u00e1bado 30 de mayo de 11am - 12pm (hora de NYC)\n\n* Se solicita un m\u00ednimo $10.00 USD para poder tener acceso a est\u00e1 masterclass.\n\nEstamos manejando estos precios simb\u00f3licos porque queremos que \u00a1todos todos nos puedan acompa\u00f1ar y disfrutar de estas Masterclasses!\n\nComo saben, debido a la pandemia mundial la industria de la m\u00fasica se ha visto fuertemente afectada.

Stamped with her affinity for finely crafted melodies and intricate storytelling, the project encompasses a blend of American music melding Rock, Soul, Rhythm and Blues, Country and Gospel. Maggie's recent album Change The Whole Thing was named by Rolling Stone as one of the \"Best Albums of 2018.\"\n\nThe resilient powerhouse recorded this album at the famed Starstruck Studios in Nashville, TN implementing an impressively demanding method highlighting an artist in complete command of her ever-evolving creative process: live with her 13-piece \u201cfamily band\u201d in one take, no overdubs, no bullshit and a sound that is best described by the following quote from Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cMaggie Rose has come into her own with this current earth-conscious, trippy country-soul stage of her ever-evolving musical persona...Rose\u2019s performances [during CMA Fest and Bonnaroo] showed her embracing her inner soul diva, belting with fire on \u2018It's You\u2019 and the pulverizing \u2018Pull You Through.\u2019 Just to drive the point home, Rose and her band even stretched out on a swinging cover of \u2018The Letter,\u2019 doing a more-than-respectable impression of the funky Mad Dogs & Englishmen arrangement originally sung by Joe Cocker.\u201d\n\nLeading to the Fall album launch, Rose incrementally released four Digital 45s from her forthcoming project beginning in October 2017 to both satisfy and build the anticipation of her growing fanbase. The initial 45 earned her a spot in the Top 10 on Sirius XM with the \u201csmoldering\u201d A-side, \u201cPull You Through.\u201d The \u201cpulverizing\u201d single was hailed by Rolling Stone as a \u201csoulful ballad that rejoices in the healing powers of love...a bare-bones track [that is] really a showcase for the Dusty Springfield-worthy vocals of Rose\u2026\u201d.\n\nIn Spring of 2018, Maggie released \"It's You\" and \"Smooth.\" Rolling Stone once again praised Maggie Rose with \"It's You\" as \u201ca giant, throwback Soul ballad that shows off her dynamic vocals [containing] shades of Aretha Franklin,\u201d and also praised \"Smooth\" as \"a supremely funky rocker with hints of Grace Potter [and] Janis Joplin\".\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding each Digital 45 release has continually increased the appetite of her fans while relentlessly expanding her following via radio, streaming platforms and through her captivating live performances. The full-length album will feature 12 songs, 12 live in-studio videos, with a full-access behind-the-scenes one-hour musical documentary which peels back the layers and allows the viewer an intimate look into the making of the album.\n\nRose has been named to YouTube\u2019s Emerging Artist and Artist in Residence 2018 programs, and Pandora named her an Artist to Watch 2018. In June, Maggie\u2019s creative breadth and versatility sparked the first-ever partnership between Prescription Songs and Sea Gayle Music, with the two companies signing a joint-venture publishing agreement with Rose. In July, she was tapped for an as-named synchronization deal that lends her voice to a national ad campaign focusing on Women\u2019s Empowerment.\n\nIn 2018, Maggie Rose has played over 150 dates across the world including\nBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, while sharing the stage with artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Julia Michaels, Brandy Clark, and Bob Weir of Grateful Dead.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "ATF ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/240841.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kraft ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Black Metal, Metal", "Time": "4:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Col\u00e9 van dais ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10352089.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "World Music, Alternative Rock, Adult Contemporary, Pop, Jazz, Rock, African, Indie", "Time": "4:30 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Cole van dais is an independent singer/ songwriter from South Africa performing original music, covers and tribute shows.\nFor more info and updates go to www.colevandais.com\n\nCol\u00e9 sings at festivals, theatres, country clubs, and corporate functions.

It\u2019s a musical relationship that has endured for over two decades, with band members playing in numerous projects together and apart. Following the 2012 release of their freewheeling Sounds Like This, the band took time off to work on various side projects. Zach Gill (keys/vocals) toured the world with the band\u2019s college pal Jack Johnson; Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar/vocals) played shows with the Grateful Dead\u2019s Phil Lesh; Steve Adams (bass/vocals) toured and recorded with Nicki Bluhm & the Gramblers; Dave Brogan (drums/vocals) joined up with Utah band, Mokie. These and other endeavors have influenced the band\u2019s new album Tangle Of Time.\n\nMore than previous releases, Tangle Of Time really taps into what makes ALO unique. It\u2019s that special blend of classic songwriting and the ability to stretch out jams and distill dance floor grooves. It's heartfelt lyrics that make you smile, reflect and just want to sing along either way. It's four great musicians who all write and sing. And four friends who've been through a lot together and still support, challenge and inspire one another.\n\nEntering Allegiant Records in San Anselmo, California this past January with co-producer Dave Simon-Baker, the four members decided they\u2019d take a different recording approach. Instead of spending pre-production days jamming and co-writing, each member brought in their own demos, roughly three dozen in total, for the group to listen to, pick apart and eventually whittle down to the 11 songs that make up Tangle Of Time. Once they narrowed their focus, they turned their attention to arrangements and production techniques. Songs were tightened up, layers made more experimental and the end results validated their new approach.\n\nLebo described the shared respect and admiration the band felt during the recording process this way: \"There are four strong opinions in the room, but playing together for so long we've all become pretty good at the empathy thing at this point; we can be very Zen about it. We truly value being together at this point in our careers, and whatever we get from our solo and side gigs, no matter how much fun we have, it's not this.\"\n\nThat sort of maturity, the ability to take stock of your friends, loved ones, and collaborators, and truly appreciate them is certainly one of the cornerstones of Tangle Of Time. Lebo, Adams and Gill first started playing music together in middle school, and then with Brogan right after college. Somehow, these relationships have lasted, evolved and been made stronger every year. One can almost hear the group releasing a satisfied existential sigh throughout the album, finding acceptance, love and contentment with the world they've built.\n\n\"I really appreciate the guys right now, more so than ever,\" Gill shared, excitedly adding, \"Years ago the feeling was, 'I wanna get to my songs and see how they sound while we're all here', whereas now I'm rooting for everyone else's songs. It's great.\"\n\nThat approach of supporting each other\u2019s songs worked like a charm, capturing each member\u2019s distinct songwriting voice, while simultaneously expanding the notion of what an ALO song or album can be. Take for instance the one-two-punch of the synth-filled, spacey jam vehicle \"The Ticket\" and the pedal steel-driven easy-going happiness of \"Simple Times\". Although two ends of the sonic spectrum, both are classic Gill songs at their core but stretched wide and far by the band\u2019s collective effort.\n\nNot to be outdone, Lebo's guitar epic \"Undertow\" is a song that practically begs to be stretched out live, with its swirling double guitar outro intoxicating the listener to such a degree that you might find yourself on the band's website, dreamily purchasing tickets for an entire run of shows just to see where the song ventures live. Lebo pairs this with \"Push\", a jaunty yet thoughtful number with a playful guitar riff that's basically the musical equivalent of joy.\n\n\"Not Old Yet\" and \"Keep On\", Adams\u2019 contributions to the album, are also touchstones to the spirit of Tangle Of Time. The first is a light-hearted romp about keeping a positive perspective on life\u2019s long road of hurdles and surprises, while the second is an upbeat, forward-thinking sing-along with lines that could be the album's mantra: \"Wherever this takes us, I know/That we've got each other, we've still got a long way to go.\"\n\nBrogan's \"Coast To Coast\" is among the most intriguing songs on the record. He, along with co-writer buddy Ben Malan, came up with a layer-upon-layer soundscape consisting of beautifully esoteric textures. The funky but ominous track tells the surreal tale of a band on the run, with more ideas and energy than know-how. Brogan shared that the theme of \u201ctangled time\u201d materialized unexpectedly over the course of the sessions, elaborating: \"There's a point where there is more behind you than ahead of you, and you realize that time becomes a limiting factor.\"\n\nPut the record on your turntable, and you can clearly hear the band\u2019s excitement to get back on the road and explore these songs with their audience. Improvisation is a staple of what the band does, and as Adams stated: \"Being in that unknown is such a great life lesson beyond just the music. For all the careful planning and preparing we do, being in the moment is really when it all matters.\"\n\nThe band is also planning new ways to expand the theatrical shenanigans that have become a fantastic complement to the live show. From confetti canons to 12-foot beach balls, pre-show skits to elaborate theme nights, bubble suits to a laser-shooting ukulele (yes, really)... ALO is always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to interact with fans to make their shows truly special. Gill, the band's head prankster, put it this way: \"I want people to come to a show expecting to be engaged in a fun and creative way. When I see someone dancing or singing along or reaching out to hit a giant beach ball, I start playing to the dancer and at that point, it's really a circle of energy traveling back and forth from the stage. The larger theatrical concepts are ways of interacting with the audience on another level.\"\n\nOn Tangle Of Time the band has reached that other level, and are ready to bring everyone along.", "otherInfo": "60+ artists, one day!

This was along with a label Aconito Records, an international label which its main headquarters in London. It is well-known for discovering several artists such as Deepbass, Ness, Claudio PRC and Giorgio Gigli. In 2015 she released her second reference named \"Environments\", which also occurred in this competent and famous label. In 2016 she made her debut in a triumphant sub-label of Dynamic Reflection called \" The Nursery\"( Sub-Label of Dynamic Reflection)and Sonntag Morgen. Kuroi's vision of techno is quite unique and different from those of other artists. She uses her own vision and applies it to her sounds, which include a wide variety of modulated and analog synths. Her first performances took place at several raves, later on she made her own path through some of the most important and mythical techno clubs in Madrid. These include Stardust, Cassette, Specka, Audium and One. Kuroi's sets are goodly welcomed by the audience as her performances are based on live and direct sounds which you can easily dance to. Another important factor that distinguishes Kuroi from the rest is that she has good adaptability skills, this means that she knows how to adapt her sounds to the audience and to the club. She is currently one of the most competent and successful deejays in her hometown, Madrid. Furthermore, Kuroi has had the pleasure to perform in remarkable clubs where techno emerged such as Tresor and About Blank in Berlin.

There\u2019s one major distinction, however, that separates her from other similarly studied musicians. That is Holly\u2019s devotion to the legendary rock band Phish. Having attended over 300 shows by the Burlington-based quartet, she became obsessed by their famous rendition of \u201cTweezer\u201d from Lake Tahoe on July 31, 2013. It led Holly to transcribe this 37-minute improvisational masterpiece note-for-note and arrange it for solo piano.

Holly\u2019s breathtaking renditions of Phish classics like \u201cIt\u2019s Ice,\u201d \u201cThe Squirming Coil\u201d and \u201cHarry Hood\u201d serve not only as a tribute to the modern day kings of jam, but stand on their own as fully developed classical pieces.

The band\u2019s seventh album, Wildness, their first in seven years, entered the UK charts at Number Two, went gold, and kept them on tour around the world for the best part of 18 months.\nThat\u2019s a lot of gigging time, but also a lot of thinking time.\n\n\u201cWhere did it all go right?\u201d echoes Lighbtody. \u201cNo idea!\u201d the singer and songwriter laughs. \u201cAfter 10 years of no success, no one \u2013 least of all us \u2013 expected us these last 15 years to sell 17 million albums, headline festivals and play to thousands of people all over the world.\u201d\nAdd to that: one billion global track streams, five UK platinum albums, an Ivor Novello award and Grammy and Mercury Music Prize nominations. And, in the shape of Chasing Cars, a modern classic recently anointed by the PPL as the most played song on UK radio of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWhen we released Final Straw in 2003, I think there was general goodwill around us from the media,\u201d continues Lightbody, \u201cas people knew the story of the previous 10 years and were kinda glad for us to get a shot on a major label,\" he notes of their move from indie Jeepster (also original home of Belle and Sebastian) to discerning Polydor imprint Fiction. That \u201csea-change\u201d set in motion the next phase of the band\u2019s existence. Still, in music, as in life, nothing is a given. \u201cOf course the good grace of the press is hard won and easy lost, but radio kept on playing us. That\u2019s been the real key to our success, I firmly believe. Radio \u2013 and, in those days when music was still being played on music, TV \u2013 changed our lives and our fortunes.\u201d\nNow, a quarter of a century since forming at Dundee University, it\u2019s time for Snow Patrol to reflect on those fortunes \u2013 and to do so in a typically song-centred way.\n\nPresenting Reworked: three brand new compositions and 13 songs from the Snow Patrol catalogue \u2013 hits and live favourites \u2013 imagined anew by the band. Tracks broken down, reassembled and reanimated in hotel rooms and dressing rooms in downtime from playing the planet's arenas. Demixes, if you like.\n\nThe inspired results take Snow Patrol somewhere new all over again. And Lightbody credits bandmate Johnny McDaid pointing them in the right direction. Lightbody figured a bunch of acoustic rerubs was the best the band could manage with the limited time they had while on the road. But as Snow Patrol had done a Reworked tour in 2009 and were planning another one in the winter of 2019. Why not, suggested McDaid, combine the two ideas?\n\n\u201cSo on the Wildness tour, Johnny set his recording gear up everywhere we went. He worked his butt off on this.\u201d In fact, the singer adds, the touring inspired some of the new musical approaches.\n\u201cWe just finished an acoustic tour of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. On those shows we did some of the songs close to how they sound on the Reworked album \u2013 for example, the new version of You\u2019re All I Have came directly out of playing those acoustic shows.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re All I Have is the opening track from 2006\u2019s Eyes Open, the album that also featured Chasing Cars. On Reworked, though, 21st century radio\u2019s biggest song is stripped back to first principles. Or, as Lightbody says, \u201cit\u2019s the song in its purest form. No big finish \u2013 stand up for the chorus! \u2013 and no bells or whistles. Just the vital parts of the song. Not so much a reworking as a tender portrayal of its essence.\u201d\n\nEyes Open is also represented by Open Your Eyes, which was the fifth single to be taken from the album. Nonetheless, the song had a remarkable afterlife in various syncs. For this album, Snow Patrol have reclaimed it with the help of onetime full-time member and ongoing occasional writing/producing wingman Iain Archer.\n\n\u201cJohnny and I recorded a few things on this song and then sent them to Iain. Iain came up with the beautiful, John Martyn-style guitar, and his version floored me when I heard it the first time. Iain\u2019s guitar playing has always been a joy to listen to and to have it feature so prominently on this album is just amazing.\"\n\nAlso presented in simple acoustic simplicity is Chocolate, the third single from Final Straw, and produced here in classy, \u201ctime-stopping\u201d style by McDaid. \u201cChocolate has been a live favourite since we released it. It\u2019s a song all Snow Patrol fans know \u2013 I can\u2019t attest that they all love it but they know it!\u201d its co-author laughs. \u201cAnd we wanted to rework the songs that the fans are the most familiar with. There's not much point in reworking songs people don\u2019t really know as there's not really a stark contrast.\u201d\nThat said, \u201cwe will be doing something with the first two albums before the release of Reworked as those two albums do not feature for that same reason,\u201d Lightbody teases.\nWhat of the recent Twitter \u201caccusation\u201d that SP have \u201cdisowned\u201d those albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It\u2019s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2001), because they don\u2019t play the songs live?\n\u201cNot true at all,\u201d he replies with a shake of the head. \u201cWe are very proud of them. It\u2019s just that when we play those songs live they negatively affect the atmosphere of the gig. And as Star Trek taught us: \u2018The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat need to entertain and surprise also informed the approach taken to Called Out In The Dark. The curtain-raiser from 2011's Fallen Empires now comes with an inventive synth throb that echoes the original.\n\u201cI had worried a little that the whole record was getting very downtempo,\u201d admits Lightbody. \u201cThe nature of recording in hotel rooms and dressing rooms is that things will invariably be low-key. Hard to rock out with a family of four in the next hotel room trying to sleep!\n\u201cSo when it came to some of the songs we recorded towards the end of the new album, we wanted to explore a slightly higher tempo \u2013 without, of course, leaning too heavy into the original version. Called Out\u2026 is certainly the closest to the original version of any song on Reworked, but I think distinct enough to warrant its place. It has an electro bent like the original but steers clear of any of its predecessor\u2019s tropes. I asked Iain to lift it up and he sure did.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the three new songs. First up, the lovely, heart-stopping Time Won\u2019t Go Slowly.\n\u201cJohnny and I wrote this in his house in LA. We\u2019re both massive fans of Frank Ocean, so we wanted it to sound like Frank Ocean crossed with Frank Sinatra. All the Franks! It\u2019s a classic crooner track. We just wanted to try something starkly different from anything we have done before.\n\"As for the lyrics, I guess I\u2019ve not written about love for a while and needed a fix,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI like the idea of the inherent tragedy woven into the fabric of time: time speeds up when we're having a great time and slows down when we're miserable. Although it\u2019s all perception, of course, not reality. And I like that, too. That distortion. Our minds are powerful and sometimes terrible things. I guess the song tries to wrap its head around that great cosmic joke. Also it\u2019s just a love song.\"\nThen there\u2019s I Think of Home, a folk-flavoured piano ballad with vivid, evocative and deeply personal lyrics. Lightbody wrote it in 2014, as part of a five-song contribution \u201cto a night dedicated to my greatest literary hero Seamus Heaney when he opened the Seamus Heaney Home Place in Magherafelt. They wanted me to play a few songs at the opening night.\n\u201cI set my own rules for the songs\u2019 content,\" he expands. \"They had to be inspired by what Heaney had been inspired by: home, family, Ireland, The Troubles, hope, the soil\u2026\u201d\nI Think of Home was later considered for inclusion on Wildness, but none of the versions the band tried out in the studio fitted.\n\u201cBut then we went on tour with Wildness and at shows in Ireland and Irish strongholds like Boston, New York, Sydney and Melbourne, I would play I Think Of Home acoustically on my own in the middle of gigs. It would always go down well.\n\u201cSo when it came to Reworked we had lived with the song enough to feel like we could do a great version of it. And Johnny produced a stunning version of it. I had been playing it a certain way for so long it was hard for me to hear it any other way. That can be dangerous \u2013 stagnation can set in. So when that happens you have to let someone you trust take it from you and remake it. So, in the spirit of what we were doing, it was great to get a reworked version of a song that had never even been released.\"\nThe third new song is Made Of Something Different Now, which is quietly sweeping, quietly epic and wholly devastating.\n\u201cOne of my favourite tracks we have done in ages,\" nods Lightbody. \"In keeping with the Reworked attitude of trying new things, it\u2019s unlike much of what we\u2019ve done before. Lyrically, it\u2019s the story of a dear friend\u2019s heartbreak. My own heart, having not been in a relationship in ten years, is unrisked so unbroken. A damning self-portrait if ever there was one! Writing this song \u2013 with Johnny \u2013 made me realise my own lack of bravery in that department. Hasn\u2019t effected any change yet, mind you, but it did start me thinking at least\u2026 Anyway, as us Celts say, it\u2019s a belter,\u201d he grins.\n\nThe final word should go to Take Back The City. Gary Lightbody\u2019s hymn to Belfast is the song that opens Reworked and is sure to be an emotive live highlight when Snow Patrol take Reworked on the road later this year. As he reflects on 25 years of Snow Patrol, how have his feelings about the city changed in the 11 years since the song was released?\n\u201cWell, as the song says, I love Belfast tonight and always. There are still things that drive me crazy about the place. But I think that's the same for everyone\u2019s home city \u2013 although my home town, of course, is Bangor.\n\u201cMy love has deepened though not waned. I see the conflict that still goes on in people\u2019s hearts, my own included, and yet there is this drive in most people \u2013 most people \u2013 to put the past behind us and move on. To lift each other up.\n\u201cWe need that now more than ever with the looming clusterfuck that is Brexit and the devastation it has the potential to bring to the whole of UK, but to Northern Ireland more than anywhere else. We need that will to put the past behind us and lift each other.\u201d\n\nHear, hear. Equally, with these 16 inspiring, enveloping tracks, this is also moment to embrace the past \u2013 and, like the man said, to use it to lift each other. This is Reworked. This is Snow Patrol\u2019s history, and their legacy. And it\u2019s their inspired next step.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Kemi Sulola ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10396448.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Rnb Ballard, Gospel, Reggae, Acoustic, R&b, Alternative, Urban, Jazz, Neo-soul", "Time": "7:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Kemi Sulola is a singer songwriter born and raised in the heart of East London.

Drawing on his experiences and surroundings John\u2019s musical repertoire includes songs with sincere, intelligent lyrics that are introspective and deeply personal, as well as tunes that are light-hearted and humourous.\n\nStarting his professional music career in 1984, John has been in a number of bands, including the award-winning \"The Town Cryers\", a band that reached the number one spot on seven radio stations in Canada with their first release in 1987 called \"All's Well.\u201d Allaire toured the country with the Cryers while releasing their 1989 CD, \"Surprise Surprise,\" which included a supporting video for Allaire's song \"Never Bin Hurt B-4.\" The video won honours as top independent video in Canada in 1989. The CD also had the dubious pleasure of being the first release in Canada by an independent band on the emerging CD format. The Town Cryers parted ways in 1992, but not before recording a whopping 18-track CD called \"Stanley's Cup.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, John founded the alt/punk band The Mercy Miners, playing with signed recording artists including Econoline Crush and Nada Surf. The Mercy Miners released a 10-song CD called Knuckle Sandwich in 1997.\n\nIn 2003, John released his first solo effort called Crime and Punishment; a 12-song collection that attracted particular attention on the east coast of Canada and throughout the USA. John\u2019s sophomore solo release \"Thank You Waitress!\" (2005) continues to be a source of fan requests at live shows, particularly the title track.\n\nJohn's 2007 release \"Ghosts of the Royal Motel\" garnered some of his best reviews with phrases like \"Canada's next music legend\", \"A new Neil Young\" and \"Perfect barroom cool.\" The video for the single \"Bourbon\" was played on national and international music television programming.\n\nJohn's 2009 release, \"Up Hill ... Both Ways\" has been selling very well in both the CD and vinyl formats. Early reviews in a US entertainment paper said, \"He has the lyrical sense of Dylan, the chops of Neil Young and his backing group reminds me of The Band...\". The American Songwriter Association awarded its \u201cBest Lyrics\u201d honours to John for his heartfelt song \u201cMagnets\u201d.\n\nJohn suffered a heart attack in October 2010 after a game of recreational hockey, but quickly bounced back and released an album in 2011 called \"Heart of Steel\" - a reflective collection of songs about seizing opportunities and living life to its fullest.\n\nNo stranger to performing, John plays an average of 120 plus shows each year in addition to regularly recording and releasing his own brand of guitar-driven alt-country/roots/folk. Each show is different from the last, with changing arrangements (acoustic and electric accompaniment), material choices, and of course John\u2019s quick wit and banter to draw in the audience. Whether playing solo or accompanied by the \u2018Campistas\u2019, John delivers a unique musical experience that does not easily fit into one genre, but is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n\nOver his 25 plus years of playing music, John has had the honour of sharing the stage with talented acts such as: The Black Crowes, Steve Earle, Snoop Dogg, City and Colour, Drive-By Truckers, Alejandro Escovedo, Alanis Morrisette, Blue Rodeo, David Lindley, Tragically Hip, Donovan, AWOLNATION, Lynn Miles, Hoodoo Gurus, BoDeans, Dr. and the Medics, Tom Wilson, The Church, VSpyVspy, Nada Surf, Econoline Crush, Weddings Parties Anything, Tom Cochrane, Grapes of Wrath, Nils, and many more...\n\nJohn is a dedicated supporter of other musicians and has been hosting someone new every Saturday afternoon at \u2018The Allaire Show\u2019 since 2010 (at Quinn\u2019s on Bank Street in Ottawa, ON).

I\u2019m Ruth\u2026welcome to my little world! I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream. (Dreams are good. I hope you have lots of them:)\nI grew up in rural western NY on a vineyard that\u2019s been in my family for over a hundred years. My grandma was the farmer\u2019s daughter and my grandpa worked on the grapes with her dad. That\u2019s how they met\u2026 Cute huh?\nMusic has been a part of my life since forever. I started playing piano and fiddle when I was three. I sang my first solo at church that year \u2013 and I also wrote my first song titled \u201cMr. Bluebird\u201d \u2013 my mom swears it was the same every time I sang it! Three was clearly a big year for me! But it was middle school when I fell in love with country music. This was 90s country at it\u2019s best \u2013 artists like Garth Brooks, Jo Dee Messina and Faith Hill were killing it on country radio and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I loved the stories they were telling through their songs. In high school it all came together when I started writing and playing the guitar. I was hooked.\nI get asked all the time how a girl from NY could possibly sing country music. Well I have a couple things to say about that: A) They play George Straight in the Wal-Mart where I\u2019m from too and B) My high school mascot was the Fredonia Hillbillies\u2026doesn\u2019t get much more country than that, does it?\nAfter graduating high school I attended Berklee College of Music where I majored in songwriting and made some lifelong friends. I fell in love with Boston (go Red Sox!) but I struggled to find my artistic voice during those years. So with hope in my heart I decided to make the move to Music City.\nWhen I moved to Nashville I started to write with everyone I could. I wrote all the time, sometimes several songs in one day and I was blessed by the support and feedback of so many talented co-writers. Within months, I finally felt like I was writing songs that were me, and through these songs, I found my voice.\nDuring this time I formed the duo Wild Honey, with another local songwriter, Victoria Gibson and we were featured on Season 1 of CMT\u2019s Can You Duet. Being on Can You Duet was the wildest experience. One week I\u2019m waiting tables and the next I\u2019m moving into the Opryland Hotel for a month of filming. Suddenly there were cameras and lights shoved in our faces almost 24 hours a day. The stakes were raised in a big way. The best way I can put it is this\u2026 where I\u2019m from, a tiny little town in NY, I never dared to dream that big\u2026 It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to sing for stadiums of millions of people\u2026 It\u2019s just that I never believed that it could happen to a small town girl like me. But all of a sudden, there I was competing on national television for a major label record deal. Can You Duet gave me the push I needed to realize that dreams do come true\u2026even for normal little people like me.\nAfter Can You Duet, it was on. I worked as hard as I could, writing everyday and back to waiting tables, sometimes till 4 in the morning to make ends meet. All that changed when I signed with Curb Records and Curb Publishing in the summer of 2011. That was a quite the summer! Within 3 months I got married, bought a house and signed a record deal! Whew\u2026 let me tell you, that was a much needed honeymoon:)\nI still live in Nashville, TN, now with my sweet husband and our two tiny dogs (Emmylou and Hazel). And I am so blessed to get to do music everyday.

I\u2019m currently recording my first album for Curb Records and it\u2019s SO exciting!!!\nThis record is the result of years of writing songs about the hurts and heartbreaks, joys and blessings, wild rides and sunny days that we all experience. This album represents everything I\u2019ve gone through while chasing down and exploring this wonderful adventure called music. In these songs, I tried to express the emotion we all go through while searching through the storm to find the light, love and home. I hope you love it!:)\nSo that\u2019s my story\u2026 That\u2019s me\u2026 I\u2019m just an ordinary girl-next-door with an extraordinary dream.

From ups to downs (and the unthinkable in between), the Tampa, FL alternative rock outfit has weathered last-minute label shifts, lineup changes, and everything else that the industry can possibly throw at a diligent, dynamic, and dedicated group of musicians. In over a decade on the scene, they\u2019ve delivered five full-length albums to a diehard fan base, culminating on 2012\u2019s 15th & Hope--the last record to be produced by the legendary Phil Ramone--enjoyed multiple television and film syncs, performed on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and played alongside everybody from Maroon 5 and Scott Weiland to Plain White T\u2019s. However, in 2014, vocalist and guitarist Don Miggs experienced something of a personal revelation that would inform his next musical step.\n\n\u201cI realized that, in some ways, I was making music to fill a hole so people could tell me I\u2019m great or chase some sort of mythical thing that somebody else deems a hit,\u201d he admits. \u201cI decided I was done doing that. You can\u2019t guarantee making anybody else happy, so you might as well make yourself happy. So, I started writing songs, and I didn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nWorking with collaborator Charlie Midnight and his MIGGS band mates Michael Lombardo [bass/vocals], John Luzzi [guitar/vocals], and Walker Adams [drums/vocals], Don churned out thirty songs in record time.\nRemarkably, this marks the first time the band has followed up an album with the same lineup, and it speaks to their chemistry and unity.\n\n\u201cWe have four completely different perspectives,\u201d John declares. \u201cWith four completely different musical tastes, I feel like we\u2019re just beginning to really mesh in the studio and live. It\u2019s exciting to be part of.\u201d\n\nOutside of MIGGS, Don stands out as an in-demand producer in his own right. He runs a studio out of Tampa, hosts his own radio show The Miggs & Swig Show on iheart radio, and will be a vintage guitar collector and aficionado forever. However, he\u2019s bringing out his most powerful statement yet in 2015 with MIGGS.\n\n\u201cDammit, I care a lot,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cI want people to listen and feel like there\u2019s a melody, and it matters. Like somehow I gave them a piece of themselves. I told a story that makes them get lost in their moment. If I can do that, on even just one of these songs, I win.

Some might say an essential part, and it\u2019s become a defining piece of the ultra-laid back, groove-ready persona he showcases throughout Europe \u201916, which captures 12 tracks and 85 minutes of Brant Bjork on the road last year with The Low Desert Punk Band supporting his two studio albums for Napalm: 2014\u2019s Black Power Flower and 2016\u2019s Tao of the Devil \u2014 both of which, it\u2019s worth noting, were of a similar leafy theme in terms of their artwork.\n\nIs it fair, then, to think of Europe \u201916 as the third in a trilogy of offerings for Napalm? Bjork has said openly that Tao of the Devil was the final studio outing on his contract for the Austrian imprint, and if one presumes a three-album deal, then it\u2019s quite possible Europe \u201916 is the farewell piece. If so, it marks a righteous summary of what Bjork has accomplished as a songwriter and performer over the last few years, returning to solo output after a successful run with Vista Chino following much tumult around touring as Kyuss Lives! and the also-Napalm-backed issue of 2013\u2019s Peace offering with that band.\n\nHighlighting cuts from Black Power Flower like \u201cControllers Destroyed,\u201d the aforementioned mindset-setting opener \u201cBuddha Time (Everything Fine)\u201d and the later \u201cStokely up Now,\u201d and even more from Tao of the Devil in \u201cHumble Pie,\u201d \u201cStackt,\u201d \u201cThe Gree Heen,\u201d as well as the later and more extended jams \u201cDave\u2019s War/Dave\u2019s Peace\u201d (based on \u201cDave\u2019s War\u201d from the record) and \u201cBiker No. 2,\u201d Europe \u201916 finds Bjork, guitarist Bubba DuPree (formerly of Void), bassist Dave Dinsmore (Ch\u00e9) and drummer Ryan G\u00fct at the proverbial top of their game in terms of chemistry, and of all the times Bjork could have issued a live album over the last decade-plus, it\u2019s easy to hear why now would be an obvious choice.\n\nJoined by guest vocalist Sean Wheeler in the second half of the set, this incarnation of Brant Bjork and the Low Desert Punk Band saunter through pieces from Bjork\u2018s substantial catalog like \u201cLow Desert Punk\u201d and \u201cLazy Bones/Automatic Fantastic\u201d from Jalamanta, \u201cFreaks of Nature\u201d from 2007\u2019s Somera S\u00f3l and \u201cLet the Truth be Known\u201d from 2005\u2019s Saved by Magic, and while live albums rarely exist that don\u2019t make the performing act come out on the positive side \u2014 that is, nobody wants to put out a shitty-sounding show \u2014 neither does Europe \u201916 shy away from the rawer side of the band\u2019s presentation, especially as regards Wheeler\u2018s vocals in \u201cBiker No. 2\u201d and \u201cFreaks of Nature\u201d and the natural movement and flow of the group\u2019s jams, which unfold beginnings and endings organically here, sounding unretouched and all the more engaging for that. Whether or not it\u2019s the last in a series of three, Europe \u201916 is a document of an era in Bjork\u2018s career that has not only seen a rise in his profile, but resulted in some of the most memorable material he\u2019s ever written.\n\nTo wit, songs like \u201cStackt\u201d and \u201cHumble Pie\u201d not only stand up to the landmark riff of \u201cAutomatic Fantastic,\u201d but they underscore the progression that\u2019s played out over time and a span of 11 LPs in Bjork\u2018s approach, and by embracing a jammier vibe later in the set in \u201cDave\u2019s War/Dave\u2019s Peace,\u201d \u201cBiker No. 2,\u201d \u201cFreaks of Nature,\u201d \u201cLow Desert Punk\u201d and \u201cLet the Truth be Known,\u201d which includes a finale take on the Rolling Stones\u2018 \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash,\u201d Europe \u201916 sets an immersive trajectory that feels true to the live experience. Of course, there\u2019s a big difference between watching a band onstage and soaking in an 85-minute live record, and the latter process is no minor undertaking, but even if one thinks of Europe \u201916 as a fan piece, it more than earns its place in Bjork\u2018s catalog, and the poise with which the band handles its turns and the commanding presence of Bjork at the forefront speak to not only the well-earned maturity of his craft but a showmanship that a studio outing simply wouldn\u2019t be able to bring into focus.\n\nNot saying much in terms of stage banter throughout, the man himself gets on mic before the get-your-ass-stoned advising of \u201cLet the Truth be Known\u201d to thank Berlin specifically after several \u201cdankesch\u00f6n\u201ds earlier on, and that brings to mind the relationship between desert rock and the EU heavy underground. There\u2019s a bit of irony there, since the Palm Desert scene, as it was in the \u201980s and early/mid \u201990s and as its legacy has grown in the years since, is so much based on the Californian landscape and American suburban culture, but no question Bjork has become the key ambassador for that movement and for the unique creativity and sound those sands helped to foster.\n\nHe\u2019ll head back abroad this fall to mark the release of Europe \u201916 and perhaps take a victory lap with The Low Desert Punk Band before moving on to other projects and ideas (or at least another outlet), but that stint, like this live album built from the last one, should only serve to reaffirm what Black Power Flower and Tao of the Devil continued to establish: that when it comes to desert rock, there\u2019s only one Brant Bjork. Nobody else brings the same level of soul to their sound, the classic feel and the steadiness of vibe that he does, and on Europe \u201916, some 17 years after first embarking on a solo career, he continues to show that in new and exciting ways.\n\nBy JJ Koczan, The Obelisk", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "The Frontier ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390436.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Alternative, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "The Frontier is a polished indie-pop project emerging from the D.C. area that combines mainstream rock and indie flavors to make a unique sound of it's own.

Sure, the pair met in Montreal in 2008. But as anyone who's been to Nevada's Black Rock Desert will tell you, Burning Man years are like dog years, and by that measure, Blond:ish has been together for a lifetime. As a youngster growing up in Canada, Vivie Ann aspired to be a computer hacker. Equally unique in her goals, Anstascia sought the acceptance of nerds. Both say they failed miserably. Eventually, their broken-heart trails converged and they created a midweek party in Montreal. Every Wednesday, they would promote, party, and DJ at the nightclub Cherry. These days, Viv and Anstascia are savy travelers. Their original productions and DJ sets are inspired, in part, by their travels and spiritual encounters. Tribal dudes chant and hum on the duo's new track, \u201cMoonbow.\u201d Dave Gahan, lead singer of Depeche Mode, provides the vocals in Blond:ish's remix of the legendary English band's \u201cShould Be Higher.\u201d Plus, they're driven to share their passion with the world, one listener at a time. \u201cA lot of people have never heard of us.

The band\u2019s follow-up single, \u201cMagnify,\u201d eclipsed the reach of the first single and also reached Top 5 at radio, followed by the equally successful single \u201cPoint To You.\u201d In addition, Mulligan\u2019s compelling songwriting can be heard on Crowder\u2019s \u201cMy Victory,\u201d as well as selections placed in film and television such as \u201cI Want You,\u201d which was chosen as the theme song for TV show \u201cCoupled,\u201d and the song \u201cI\u2019ll Think About You\u201d featured in the most deeply moving moment of the feature film The Shack.\n\nSince their debut release in 2016, We Are Messengers has played to more than 600,000 people as a part of the Winter Jam Tour Spectacular, the largest annual tour in Christian music, on major tours with Big Daddy Weave and the K-LOVE Christmas Tour alongside Steven Curtis Chapman, and has built a loyal fan base on their own headlining tours.\n\nWhether on stage or in the studio, We Are Messengers presents its truth with a confidence and purity that cuts through the noise. \u201cWe try to write simple songs for a very complicated world,\u201d shares Mulligan. \u201cAt the very core of what we do is honesty and transparency.

I want to be vulnerable and write songs that allow people to meet with God right where they are, in their humanity.\u201d\n\nMulligan\u2019s sensitive heart for the lost and hurting shines through in his songs as he himself was once lost and hurting.

His life was spiraling out of control when he received a call from his girlfriend Heidi telling him she had become a Christian. Shortly thereafter, he decided to leave the band, move back to Ireland and asked her to marry him. Unbeknownst to Mulligan, she had been praying daily for her future husband\u2019s salvation. Three weeks before their wedding, at a time when he was an avowed atheist, Mulligan had a life-altering experience in church and surrendered his life to Christ.\n\nHe eventually picked up his guitar again and began writing music rooted in faith. Today, the songs he writes and the stories he shares from stage stem from his own dramatic conversion and subsequent transformation. \u201cWe want to tell people about the goodness of God.

Over time, Buffalo Tom stripped away their grungier influences and developed into a straight-ahead rock group of the early '90s, capable of throttling rockers and beautiful ballads. Comprising guitarist/vocalist Bill Janovitz, bassist/vocalist Chris Colbourn, and drummer Tom Maginnis, Buffalo Tom began to develop their own style with their second album, 1990's Birdbrain, which featured a noticeable improvement in songwriting. In 1992, Buffalo Tom released Let Me Come Over, a gritty set of driving rock and achingly melancholy ballads; several of its tracks became alternative radio staples, including the gorgeous ballad \"Taillights Fade.\" Despite an increased amount of critical praise and some radio airplay, the album didn't sell. The follow-up, 1993's Big Red Letter Day, featured a more polished, radio-ready production, but the album received only a small push from radio and MTV. \"Soda Jerk,\" the first single from the album, became a minor alternative radio and MTV hit. After a yearlong tour, the group returned in the summer of 1995 with Sleepy Eyed, a return to the more direct sound of Let Me Come Over. Smitten followed in 1998, and two years later a best-of, Asides from Buffalo Tom, arrived. Almost a decade of inactivity followed, but things weren't over for Buffalo Tom; they returned in 2007 with an appearance at SXSW and a new full-length album on the New West label, Three Easy Pieces. Skins, the band's eighth studio album, arrived in early 2011 through their own Scrawny Records label. From this point onward, Buffalo Tom were for the most part retired, but the band periodically reunited for live shows. In 2017, after Beggars Banquet released an expanded 25th anniversary edition of Let Me Come Over, the trio reconvened for a short run of dates in the United States and Europe. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi", "otherInfo": "Facebook Live"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "PhaseOne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9171363.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Dubstep, Riddim, Heavy Metal, Bass Music, Drum & Bass", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Hailing from Sydney, PhaseOne is an Australian legend.

Sandwiched between gatefold LPs, 12-inch singles, dub versions and white-labels was a reservoir of inspiration that he would draw on for the following decades. That was then. This is now. Since his college days, Bay Area-native Lyrics Born\u2019s raw, authentic talent has been polished to a gleaming beacon of originality in a time when it\u2019s needed most, and it\u2019s release marks a new era of label relations. \u201cThe old model is dead, you cant just put it out and expect people to get it\u201d, explains LB, and the statement could easily be applied to his sound or his approach to marketing the finished product.\n\nLyrics Born has gone about the creation of his latest effort, As U Were, in a less-than-conventional manner. One defining characteristic of his sound thus far has been that it can be described as unequivocally fun, and this remains true of As U Were. However, LB does routinely peel back the gregarious exterior to reveal a contemplative everyman, and it\u2019s times like this that his true artistry is apparent. \u201cIt\u2019s at the point in my career where I\u2019ve been through a lot, fun and not so fun. I think I\u2019m dealing with a lot issues that are more mature than the last few albums, from abandonment to betrayal to incredible joy\u201d. He voices these sentiments prominently on the lead single \u201cLies x 3\u201d, a driving, heartfelt plead for truth.\n\nWhile touching on newer subjects, he also reached out to artists that he felt removed himself from his comfort zone. \u201cThe new record is more synth-oriented. I made an effort to work with younger artists: Trackademicks, Francis and The Lights, and Sam Sparro, namely\u201d. The bay-swagger is in full effect on \u201cFunky Hit Records\u201d, and while the new guests add a new dimension to the sound, Tom Shimura isn\u2019t one to lose sight of his roots. Gift of Gab drops a requisite, thought-provoking verse on the critical \u201cPills\u201d and the classic Latyrx tag-team makes it look way too easy on \u201cPushed Aside, Pulled Apart\u201d, one of the album\u2019s standout cuts. As U Were may well be LB\u2019s greatest achievement, but it\u2019s been a long time coming.\n\nLyrics Born had been a music obsessive since his youth, and in 1993 freestyles among a group of UC Davis classmates that occupied the same cramped radio quarters began to find their way onto paper, and suddenly LB had written \u201cSend Them\u201d. It became the first single on the newly minted Solesides Records, a collaborative venture between himself and his accomplices who would later go on to be known internationally as Blackalicious (comprised of MC Gift of Gab and producer Chief Xcel), DJ Shadow and Lateef The Truthspeaker, an East Oakland rapper with whom he found a shared affinity for the rapid-fire lyrical volleys that would define the next step. As Latyrx (a combination of their working names) the two MCs released The Album, in 1997. The LP would go on to become a certified classic, selling 100,000 copies, yet would prove to be the tip of an even larger iceberg.\n\nSolesides was re-imagined as Quannum Projects in 1999. As co-owner, LB used Quannum as a conduit through which he delivered his most realized project to date, 2003\u2019s Later That Day. The album yielded his biggest commercial success to date, \u201cCallin\u2019 Out\u201d, which charted nationally and was featured in several major motion pictures, EA Sports games as well as a Diet Coke spot featuring Adrian Brody. The remix LP, Same !@#$ Different Day was released shortly after, showcasing the talents of his closest associates and as well as new material. Meanwhile, Lyrics Born began to explore different means of engaging listeners. He kept fans abreast of his work by peppering the internet with The Lyrics Born Variety Show mixtape series which he released himself through his website. The mixtapes, as well as ceaseless touring and the creation of his own internet media outlets Lyrics Born TV and LBFM, were elements of a new formula.\n\nSince the release of Later That Day, Lyrics Born has averaged over 150 shows a year, and his explosive live energy was captured on the disc Overnite Encore, a compilation of live performances with live musicians from the Australian leg of his 2006 world tour. He followed up in 2008 with Everywhere At Once, a varied studio disk that signaled a departure from the sample-based pieces he had become known for, supplementing the sound with a full band and a healthy dose of synthesizers. Hence, he has arrived at well-rounded sound that is classic and yet futuristic. Tom Shimura hasn\u2019t forgotten how he got here, but he\u2019s never been afraid to look to the future, either.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "G-REX ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8734311.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Bass Music, Dubstep", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "Although the origins of G-REX can be dated back to 2015, 2019 was certainly the biggest year yet for Detroit native producer, Jake Sweeney.

It was during these formative years that Fokis developed a love for music and a work ethic that placed him amongst hip hop\u2019s hardest working entrepreneurs. Fokis began rhyming at an early age and later began to produce his own music. Seeking to enhance his career, Fokis pursued formal training as a recording engineer, later opening his own recording studio Krystal Clear Recordings. There, Fokis recorded and mixed for many artists including Big Daddy Kane, Fat Joe, Skyzoo, Torae, Dres, N.O.R.E, Kool G Rap, Brand Nubian, Chi-Ali, Ras Kass, Mic Geranimo, Bubba Sparxx and Rahsaan Patterson. His passion and commitment to succeed literally placed him on the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d. Early in his career, Fokis developed an online reality show based on his own experience as an independent hip hop artist seeking to secure a record deal within a year\u2019s time. Consistent with reality, the \u201cRoad to the Riches\u201d did not result in Fokis signing a record deal. Not deterred, Fokis went on to release several albums collaborating with various artists such as Joe Budden, Olu Dara (Nas\u2019 father), Deemi, Joell Ortiz and various producers such as Ty Fyffe, Focus\u2026(Aftermath Ent.) Fantom Of The Beat and Jake One. Fokis released various projects including the \u201c20/20\u201d EP exclusively produced by Focus of Aftermath \u201cRecognize Your Power\u201d EP with Edo. G & Shabaam Sahdeeq which was produced entirely by Fokis, \"This Thing Called Life\" which was produced by Oh No. all of which were well received by his fans.\n\nFokis has toured the United States and abroad, performed as an opening act for artists such as Common, Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., The Beatnuts, Onyx, Das Efx, Masta Ace and more. Through his experiences, Fokis developed a relevant broad appealing style and sound that remains true to the core foundational elements of Hip Hop with a commercial appeal. Though achieving success releasing his own music, Fokis realized in this era it would take more than pursuing a career as a recording artist to rise to the level of success he sought to achieve. As his experience with the business side of the industry grew, Fokis established his own independent record label, Loyalty Digital Corp. Through his label, Fokis has worked with and Executive produced projects like \u201cAn Ode To Reasonable Doubt\u201d by Skyzoo & Antman Wonder, \u201cBarrel Brothers\u201d by Skyzoo & Torae, \u201cNever Left\u201d by Sadat X and various others. Most recently, Fokis has created a membership based artist and producer collective called Local-Mu12. The members span from all over the world and are wrapping up their third LP for release this year. Fokis & Loyalty Digital\u2019s many achievements have been recognized by various blogs such as Complex, HipHopDX, NahRight, 2DopeBoyz, RapRadar, XXL and The Source to name a few.

Du\u00e9 le quartz disbanded in September of 2002, with Miyabi following up shortly afterwards with the announcement of his solo career.\n\nSolo Career: Miyabi appeared on TV to promote his debut album, Gagaku, also stressing the name change from \"Miyabi\" to \"\u96c5-miyavi.\" He continued to stress this change on into the first year of his solo career. It wasn't long before he had amassed a very large fanbase, despite having lost some of his old fanbase from his Du\u00e9 le quartz days, going on to release multiple singles and another album. About two years later, in late 2004, he was signed (or \"married\" as Universal and he had jokingly put it) to Universal Records Japan, making the transition from Indies to major. It was then that he made a second name change to MYV. As previously stated, however, it appears to be a shortened version of \"\u96c5-miyavi,\" as he still appears in magazines (and is listed on his website) as \"\u96c5-miyavi.\" His release, Rock no Gyakushuu -Super Star no Jouken-, marked his major debut.\n\nNew Band: S.K.I.N - After a four month long stay in America, \u96c5-miyavi accomplished something new, which might have come as a surprise for a few. Upon return to Japan, \u96c5-miyavi announced in a video comment (link posted on his official website) that he would like to \"try screaming in the background again\" and thus found an amazing guy (older than him) and will start their band in 2007. Although he did not say more, he also assured that he would also like to continue producing as a solo artist.\n\nIt has been confirmed that \u96c5-miyavi is part of the new super-band, S.K.I.N along with YOSHIKI, Gackt and Sugizo. They debuted on June 29th at Anime Expo, playing their first gig, during which it was announced that Ju-Ken (Gackt) would be their support member playing the bass.", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Vanness Wu ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Bad Bad Hats ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8716873.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Pop, Indie Pop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "New album \"Lightning Round\" out August 3rd via Afternoon Records!", "otherInfo": "Our weekly YouTube series, featuring covers, originals, Q+A and more.

Throughout his youth, his father exposed him to a wide variety of Eastern and Western music, giving Menert fertile soil in which to plant his musical visions. His passion for original analog sounds coupled with a vast knowledge of music history has given him an even larger platform from which to produce. A multi-instrumentalist, he incorporates live guitar and keys into his final production for a full sound and rich feel. By tapping into the world of music that surrounds him, Menert twists and turns day-to-day inspirations into music that is all his own.\n\nMenert worked as the co-producer with Derek Vincent Smith on the chart topping Pretty Lights album Taking Up Your Precious Time, and was a natural choice to be the first artist to join Pretty Lights Music in 2010 with the release of his solo album, Dreaming of a Bigger Life. Michal\u2019s second album with PLM, the critically acclaimed mega-LP Even If It Isn\u2019t Right, dropped in the spring of 2012. Within just a few short months, Menert was landing headlining slots at some of the most prestigious venues in the country.\n\nHis musical collaborations have brought him a wealth of inspiration, and led to the formation of a number of ongoing side projects including Half Color (with Paul Basic), Manic Menert (with Manic Focus), and a slew of others. 2014 saw the culmination of a musical dream with the debut of the Michal Menert Big Band \u2013 an 18-piece ensemble led by Michal that performed his catalog in front of thousands, including headlining performances at Denver\u2019s Fillmore Auditorium and direct support at Colorado\u2019s famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre.\n\nA dynamic and ideological producer, Menert has always taken a community driven approach. He works hand in hand with producers he chooses for his own record label, Super Best Records. By collaborating and working closely with a new generation of hip-hop & EDM producers, he\u2019s bringing a new musical vision to life without any imposed limitations.\n\nThe Spring of 2015 saw the release of Michal\u2019s third LP, Space Jazz on Super Best Records, to an extraordinary response from fans and press. That fall, Menert released the first LP, \u201c1\u201d with his live indie-soul band Michal Menert & the Pretty Fantastics. His sound combines vintage vinyl samples with rich analog synthesis and organic, hard-hitting beats. It\u2019s a fusion of yesterday\u2019s elements and tomorrow\u2019s ideas. Catch him on tour throughout 2015 and beyond.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "MISO ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Electronic, Trip Hop", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Ghastly ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9027199.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Doesnt Matter", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "sup im the ghost kid.", "otherInfo": "Couch Lands is back with a brand new Virtual Stage featuring DJ sets by Doctor P, Funtcase, Ghastly, Riot Ten, Boogie T, ATLiens, PhaseOne and more!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "alextbh ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8874332.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "twink pop music", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Joe Flizzow ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Julia Wu ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Nisha ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/264774.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Live Stream\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amazonmusic"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "FuntCase ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9229443.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Dubstep", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "OFFICIAL FUNTCASE FANPAGE PRESS LIKE FOR ALL INFO FUNTCASE BASED, INCLUDING: [[[Gigs, Releases, Up and Coming Tracks and many more...]]] Subscribe to my Channel: http://bit.ly/1apQMTd", "otherInfo": "Couch Lands is back with a brand new Virtual Stage featuring DJ sets by Doctor P, Funtcase, Ghastly, Riot Ten, Boogie T, ATLiens, PhaseOne and more!"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Guitar Mash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9837672.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "To contribute what we can for collective sanity and joy, Guitar Mash is thrilled to announce #HomeMadeMusic, a series of Virtual Campfires.

His ability to pair intense/aggressive sounds with beautiful and often peaceful/tranquil melodies brings a brilliant balance to his music that not many other artists are able to achieve.

The group's nucleus of composer/trackmaker/producer Taku and rapper Verbal first became friends while the two were attending St. Mary's International School, a Tokyo based international high school. Later Taku moved to California, where he worked as a DJ and began composing. At this juncture the ethnically Korean Verbal went to school in Boston, where he also got deeper into rap music. Verbal also got into Christianity, so much that he majored in theology, but his friend Taku convinced him to return to Tokyo to pursue music.\n\nIn 1998 they hooked up again in Tokyo, and brought into their musical circle the Japanese-Colombian female singer Lisa, who attended Seisen International School, St. Mary's sister school. Lisa had already begun working in music, including serving as vocalist for the group ram jam world. The group released their first song been so long as a 12-inch single on an indie label, and were soon picked up by the Avex-affiliated Rhythm Zone label. From Avex they released a string of hit singles, and then their debut album Planet Shining, which went to #6 on the Oricon album chart. The group followed this success up with the re-mix album THE REPLACEMENT PERCUSSIONISTS and a sold-out tour. The group also toured in Korea, where they were well received.\n\nTheir wide ranging popularity led to a number of side projects and collaborations, including Taku working on music by major stars like Hikaru Utada, Crystal Kay, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yumi Matsutoya, and Verbal working with the Korean superstar female idol group S.E.S. One S.E.S. member, Shoo, was actually born in Yokohama and speaks Japanese, which helped allow the group to attain some level of popularity in Japan in addition to their mega-success in Korea. Verbal has also worked with the pop duos Heartsdales and Halicali, and up and coming foreign idol Christina Milian. In 2001 the group released EXPO EXPO, and again released a remix album and toured.\n\nIn 2002 Lisa released the self-produced single move on. The song it seems was an announcement of sorts, as soon after she announced that she was leaving m-flo to concentrate on a solo career. After Lisa's departure m-flo have continued on as a duo, often recording with other artists. They developed a concept of sorts, the \u201cm-flo loves **** \u201d series, with a guest artist\u2019s name filling in the blank, such as \u201cm-flo loves Akiko Wada\u201d. In May 2004 they released the CD Astromantic and followed it with a related DVD. Astromantic was an album full of collaborations, including cuts with such major artists as BoA, Chemistry, Double, Kenji Furuya (of Dragon Ash), Ken Yokoyama (of Crazy Ken Band), and Maki Nomiya (of Pizzicato Five), and eventually released a remix album, Astromantic Charm School, where other composers and mixers would remix the songs from Astromantic. Two years later, m-flo released the album Beat Space Nine, which featured such artists as Yoshika, Emyli, Diggy Mo of SOUL'd OUT, Akiko Wada, and even a song with Lisa. A remix album, Dope Space nine was released much like Charm School.\nRecently, an m-flo Inside WORKS BEST II has been released, bringing together some of their best tracks, and remixing them.

Thile had set himself a formidable musical challenge and, as befits this enthusiastically risk-embracing artist, he was more than up to the task. In addition to traveling, planning, rehearsing, and performing on the fifteen episodes of APHC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season, Thile managed each week to create a funny, topical, and at times quite poignant new song he would play with a rotating cast of APHC band-mates and guest stars. These were not throwaway radio bits, but smart, fully realized compositions. They served the needs of the show but were just as timely and engaging on their own.\n\nIn July 2017, Thile went into New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios with producer and longtime friend Thomas Bartlett and that\u2019s when these songs gained an even deeper resonance. As they listened through the APHC versions, Thile and Bartlett realized that, taken together, these songs could form an album-length narrative. Part of the story Thile found was autobiographical. Thanks for Listening represents perhaps the most direct and personal material Thile has ever recorded. It reflects the changes to his own peripatetic life as he assumes a new role as APHC host and, behind the scenes, as a new dad\u2014while continuing to play with his band Punch Brothers and collaborate with such artists as Brad Mehldau, Edgar Meyer, and Yo-Yo Ma. We learn what delights him (like the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series,) and what alarms him (the polarized state of our nation post-election). But Thile also tells a broader tale\u2014satirically, wistfully, frankly\u2014 about the divisions and disconnects plaguing America today, whether it\u2019s on social media or at the Thanksgiving table. The overarching theme, Thile realized, was about the art of listening\u2014the joys of it, the current difficulties of it, and the necessity of hearing what others have to say, not just the overwhelming desire to be heard.\n\nListening, or the lack thereof, figures prominently on several tracks: \u201cFeedback Loop\u201d lampoons the way social media filters out all but those one agrees with, while \u201cModern Friendship\u201d rues the way old pals can drift apart\u2014and suggests that maybe sharing a well-made night cap could help solve that. \u201cStanley Ann\u201d is a graceful imagining of what Barack Obama might have said to his late mom as he departed the White House in January. The deceptively cheerful \u201cFalsetto,\u201d on the other hand, is an all-too-kind speculation on how the current occupant of the White House might gracelessly scold an activist entertainer\u2014managing to insult the singer\u2019s \u201cgirly falsetto\u201d in the process.\n\n\u201cMy initial working title was Get It out on the Radio\u201d (the name of the song he performs at the end of each APHC episode). But the album pivoted away from the show and toward the listeners\u2014and not just to the listeners of Prairie Home but to anyone who listens to things. They are my heroes\u2014people who listen. I find myself all too often on the other side of the conversation, talking about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s hard to maintain focus or give something enough attention to appreciate it. We\u2019re in a place where listening is a precious commodity. That\u2019s the theme that I noticed rising up, greater than \u2018here is what was happening last week\u2019 or \u2018here is the place we were.\u2019 It\u2019s a celebration of people who haven\u2019t switched off, despite being given every reason to do so.\u201d\n\nThe arrangements have an intimate, dream-like quality to them; the songs feel like reveries, not statements. Thile\u2019s voice is at times double- or triple-tracked, cossetted by subtle echo. He delivers vocal takes that are by turns wry and soulful, frequently deploying a lovely falsetto in an especially evocative way, more Beach Boys than bluegrass. The chorus of \u201cThank You, New York,\u201d performed with singer Gaby Moreno, is a vocal stand-out, a nose-thumbing good riddance to the turbulent year that was 2016 (and a nod to the resilience of New York City and its occupants). Thile\u2019s mandolin playing remains front and center\u2014and it the sole instrument on \u201cBalboa\u201d \u2014but it is often bolstered by Bartlett\u2019s subtle, slightly mysterious, layering of keyboards and electronics.\n\n\u201cI was deeply desirous of a record that sounded like it was coming from your own head. That\u2019s where we veered away from a more archival studio approach\u2014where you go in, perform the songs, and record exactly how those performances sounded,\u201d Thile says. \u201cThe recordings on Thank You for Listening are more fanciful in construction.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I would be at the big room of Reservoir Studios making maps of these songs with whatever stringed instruments seemed appropriate and singing scratch vocals. Then Thomas would take them into his little room and start experimenting on them. And I would start the next map,\u201d he continues. \u201cI would get my pass by having written the song and having created a keep-able demo of the song and then Thomas would get his pass without me looking over his shoulder, telling him \u2018that\u2019s not how it goes.\u2019 Which I\u2019m unable to not do if I\u2019m in the room. It was like an editor editing a novel.\u201d\n\nLike Thile, multi-instrumentalist Bartlett is a musical polymath, comfortable in diverse collaborative situations. He often sits in with the National; he plays piano in the Irish Music group The Gloaming; and he occasionally performs on his own under the Doveman moniker. Rather than enlisting a full APHC-style band in the studio, the pair conceived the project largely as a musical dialogue between them\u2014a listening session of their own, if you will.\n\nThile manned all the stringed instruments, save for bass (from Alan Hampton) and viola (from Nadia Sirota, on the title track). Ted Poor\u2014like Hampton, a member of Andrew Bird\u2019s touring band\u2014played drums on five tracks. Bartlett provided, in Thile\u2019s words, \u201cwhatever sounds weren\u2019t accounted for.\u201d Thile also invited three guest singers to the sessions, all of whom had performed multiple times on APHC: Sarah Jarosz, Gaby Mereno, and Aoife O\u2019 Donovan. He says, \u201cAll three had made really meaningful contributions to how the songs ended up expressing themselves. That goes for all the musicians who played on this last APHC season. They all made such meaningful contributions to these songs. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d\n\nThe original \u201cSong of the Week\u201d versions can be easily accessed via YouTube, now that all the APHC shows are live-streamed and subsequently archived. The performances are full of personality and humor, as Thile, a dependably energetic live performer, interacts with a roster of players that include various Punch Brothers, brilliant guitarist Julian Lage, and Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek. Contrasting these versions with the new studio recordings, one can appreciate the sort of magical transformation that took place at Reservoir Studios, one that was more about inspiration than analysis.\n\nThe process effected a transformation on Thile too: \u201cBefore hosting Prairie Home, I would listen to music much the way an athlete trains. Listening was like hitting the gym, like a pitcher strengthening his rotator cuff. I was listening to improve specific aspects of my musicianship or nourish it in specific ways. The hosting has brought me back into being a music lover, just listening with the idea of enjoying the three to five minutes of a performance, not worrying about whether it\u2019s rendering my sense of counterpoint more sophisticated or increasing my knowledge of how sonata form works or giving me more arrows in my improvisational quiver.\u201d He continues, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u2018do I like this? Is my life better since listening to this song?\u2019 That\u2019s what I care about now.\n\n\u201cI think that development led me to ask Thomas to produce Thanks for Listening,\u201d Thile concludes. \u201cHe and I have stayed up late drinking Amaro and listening to records. I often hold vast amounts of myself back to analyze things and Thomas would consistently play me things that would disarm that side of me. I was yearning to make a set of music that maybe hits more of those marks, to have some of that rub off on me. I hope I succeeded with Thanks for Listening.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michael Hill", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "John Michael Ferrari Singer Songwriter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10398469.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Country Pop, Country, Inspirational, Pop", "Time": "9:45 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "John Michael Ferrari writes emotional story-telling songs with a touch of sophistication in the standard, country, country/pop, and country/gospel genres.

It was a bit of good luck.\u201d\n\nThese grainy, absorbing images play over the exhilarating whirl of \u201cDivebomber\u201d, a song inspired by the World War II film of the same name, and one of several on his new album that evoke a sensation of sharp ascent, of giddy height, the free-fall thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rush, if you fly fast enough. With a rush of blood, you can bet you forget everyone.\u201d\n\nFinn did not set out on his third solo album with a theme in mind. But by the time he came to call it after another track on the record, \u201cDizzy Heights\u201d, it had become inescapable. \u201cIt crept up on me. I started noticing it in lots of places.\n\n\u201cYou start off with a number of different threads and angles and demos, and they dictate the terms of the record. It\u2019s only in the course of the process that you maybe get a feeling there\u2019s a type of song emerging, or an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe cloud jumpers epitomise, too, the Finn creative process: an attachment to a work-ethic and prosaic rigour - \u201ca willingness to be disciplined, punctual and focused\u201d \u2013 but designed for the arrival of something more, \u201cto capture the little flashes of complete happenstance or good fortune that come your way \u2013 often from a mistake\u201d.\n\nAn indirect inspiration for the height motif is mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1953, five years before Neil was born. \u201cHilary had a huge impact on my generation of New Zealanders,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the New Zealand DNA about trying to scale impossible heights. It\u2019s something that can be very positive, but also has its downside.\u201d\n\nAmid its vertiginous, richly melodic swirl, Dizzy Heights contemplates love (\u201cBetter than TV\u201d), loss (\u201cFlying in the Face of Love\u201d), ageing (\u201cRecluse\u201d) and allure (\u201cLights of New York\u201d). It peeks, too - in \u201cIn My Blood\u201d, for example - into the abyss.\n\nNeil Finn was 18 when he was invited by his older brother Tim to join the trailblazing art rock band Split Enz. His career since might be measured as a series of bounds, the best-known being Crowded House, which he founded with Paul Hester and Nick Seymour after the breakup of Split Enz in 1984. Four albums, among them Crowded House and Together Alone, brought the group popular and critical acclaim around the world.\n\nAlong the way, there have been a host of collaborations, including with brother Tim and wife Sharon, and an array of names from Johnny Marr, Ed O\u2019Brien, Eddie Vedder and most of Wilco. There have been two solo records, Try Whistling This and One Nil (or One All). And yet Dizzy Heights unmistakably marks a fresh leap.\n\nWith wife Sharon (bass) and sons Liam (guitar) and Elroy (drums), Finn travelled in two bursts to producer Dave Fridmann\u2019s Tarbox Road studio in upstate New York, to record songs composed at his Auckland studio, Roundhead. With Fridmann (Mercury Rev, The Flaming Lips), and in collaborations with young New Zealand musicians Connan Mockasin and SJD, Finn has assembled a textured, heady sound, furnished and elevated by woozy strings and soaring vocals.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it a solo record in a stripped back singer-songwriter sort of way,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI had a feeling Dave would be good at adding some odd shapes to the music. Which I always welcome \u2013 making things a little more expansive ... He is good at subverting things, and making things sound a bit messed up and not as obvious, rather than being too tasteful, which is always a temptation.\u201d\n\nFinn remembers an important English teacher, from four decades ago at his high school in Te Awamutu, a small rural town in New Zealand\u2019s north island. His name was Ron Martin, and he raced them through the School Certificate syllabus in a matter of weeks, to clear space for reading, writing, arguing, making films (\u201cHe [later] gave me a Super-8 movie I\u2019d made in his class, and I\u2019d done a kind of dramatised version of the song \u2018Aqualung\u2019 by Jethro Tull ... I was dressed as a tramp with an old coat\u201d).\n\nSays Finn: \u201cWe had a very spirited debate one day in class about whether having big aspirations, big dreams, was a good idea given it can ultimately lead to disillusionment and isolation and at worst bitterness. There was quite a lot of variance of opinion, and I definitely came out for the, yeah, you\u2019ve got to have the big dreams and big aspirations and it doesn\u2019t matter, what the hell.\n\n\u201cI think of that sometimes when ambition, or having big dreams, seems slightly shallow and vain. Because the motivations they shift \u2013 imperceptibly sometimes ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like those boys, jumping off that cliff. I keep thinking back to the one who runs to the edge and stops twice, before leaping off. Life carries on being like that.\u201d\n\n- TOBY MANHIRE", "otherInfo": "Neil Finn is back for more Fangradio live audio streams on Mixlr, Tuesdays and Saturdays at 3pm PT.\n\n\"Tuesday will be broadcast from my place, more or less solo.

Perhaps the greatest element of David Guetta\u2019s illustrious story is not simply his countless personal successes, but his wider game-changing approach. From making dance music and DJ culture more of a viable and legitimised commercial success than ever before to finally uniting the worlds of electronic and urban music, the repercussions of his visionary attitude cannot be underestimated.\n\nDavid has established himself as arguably the world\u2019s biggest and most successful DJ of all time by fusing dance music with urban artists. By teaming up with some of the biggest names in hip hop and R&B, and reinventing their sound for the electronic dancefloors, Guetta created pop alchemy. The ensuing hits such as \u2018I Gotta Feeling\u2019 with Black Eyed Peas, \u2018When Love Takes Over\u2019 with Kelly Rowland and \u2018Sexy Bitch\u2019 with Akon propelled him to superstardom. They also set a new template for the sound of commercial radio. This was instrumental in turning electronic music into the biggest youth movement since hip hop.\n\nOf course, his own groundbreaking accomplishments cannot be overlooked either. 50 million album and single sales; over 10 billion YouTube and Spotify plays; numerous #1 singles and Platinum and Gold certifications across the globe; two Grammys for Best Remixed Recording and four further nominations; one of the most successful club nights Ibiza has ever seen; one of the biggest social media followings of any DJ/producer; the first DJ to be on the cover of Billboard, the list goes on and on and on\u2026\n\nWith all his success as a chart-topping producer, it\u2019s all too easy to forget about his hallowed heritage as a highly respected DJ. Promoting raves in his native Paris with nothing more than photocopied flyers, he rose through the influential \u2018French touch\u2019 era that saw the likes of Daft Punk come to fame, but was soon forging his own path through the dance music scene. Whether he\u2019s playing at one of his residencies at XS and Encore in Las Vegas or Ushua\u00efa Ibiza or playing mega festivals like Tomorrowland (where he has performed since its first year) and Ultra Music Festival, he never forgets those humble roots. His \u2018classical\u2019 training in the art of mixing combined with his enduring appeal and continual relevancy ensured him the #6 spot on the DJ Mag Top 100 and a Billboard award for Top Dance/Electronic artist most recently.\n\nCiting his role in the studio in the vein of a classic producer, Guetta sits as the musical brain at the center of the project, bringing it all together. His incredible list of collaborators over the years has included Madonna, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Usher, Sia, John Legend, Nicki Minaj, Kelly Rowland, Showtek, Avicii, Ne-Yo, Akon, Afrojack and Nicky Romero for starters, but he has also been a keen supporter of lesser-known talent. The likes of Sam Martin and Chris Willis have both enjoyed continual support from Guetta, showing that he\u2019s not just about the A-listers but also about championing hot new names. \u201cOf course it\u2019s amazing to work with famous people,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut the reason behind their fame is their talent. But I also love finding talented people who are not famous, it\u2019s equally amazing to put the spotlight on them.\u201d\n\nAlways in high demand outside of the clubs, festivals and studios, Guetta\u2019s extra-curricular activities have ranged from providing the original soundtrack and musical direction for the UEFA Euro 2016 football championship to being a key partner for UNICEF and an early supporter of groundbreaking legal mix uploading platform Dubset. Never hesitating to help charities, David joined forces with the United Nations in support of \u2018\u2019The World Needs More\u2019\u2019 campaign to raise funds for humanitarian emergencies.\n\nOne of his latest releases Would I Lie To You is seeing him return to the club dancefloors, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019ll never be defined by just one side of his career. His passion for music remains undying, and while the world continues to watch his every move with anticipation, he\u2019ll ignore the pressure and continue his ongoing search for that perfect beat.\n\nHis latest release Shed A Light is a dance pop ballad that is bound to leave a lasting impression across the globe.

He composes, arranges, collaborates, improvises and has even been known to sing a song here and there in both English and Italian. But what he does create on the guitar makes the difference between simply playing and truly making music apparent in the most wonderful ways.\n\nD\u2019Agostino has been hailed as \u201ca guitarist\u2019s guitarist\u201d by Acoustic Guitar magazine as well as \u201ca giant of the acoustic guitar\u201d (San Diego Reader), and holds many top guitar awards, but the San Francisco Chronicle encapsulated the essential difference that distinguishes D\u2019Agostino\u2019s music when it dubbed him \u201ca poet.\u201d\n\nThat poetic eloquence, grace and magic suffuses Nine White Kites, his first album of new compositions for the guitar in a decade (during which time he\u2019s done much else wonderful with his musical talents). The set of 11 songs and two bonus tracks launches with the soaring fingerpicking of the title track, leading the listener through a tour de force showcase of D\u2019Agostino\u2019s mastery and artistry.\n\nNumbers like \u201cBarefoot in Rio\u201d (on which D\u2019Agostino makes a rare appearance on nylon string guitar), \u201cCowboy Minestrone\u201d (an homage to master country picker Jerry Reed) and \u201cReggae Ragu\u201d travel through spots on the musical globe where he finds stylistic inspiration to blend with his own international roots, while \u201cSan Francisco 1982\u201d revisits the allure of the city he first visited on vacation that year and soon after returned to and made his home. \u201cStreet Pulse\u201d bristles with a kinetic urban energy, \u201cImminent Dawn\u201d evokes the mystical junction of night becoming day, \u201cJump Rope\u201d is a stunning showcase of guitar athleticism and dexterousness, and the sparse and subdued \u201cSilence In Between\u201d captures the music in the space among the notes. \u201cClare\u2019s Gifts\u201d and \u201cSweet Sylvia\u201d are D\u2019Agostino\u2019s musical Mona Lisas that paint women on guitar. D\u2019Agostino wraps it up with two Italiano melodic deserts on the bonus tracks: \u201cNella Fantasia,\u201d an Ennio Morricone melody (originally \u201cGabriel\u2019s Oboe\u201d in the film The Mission) with lyrics by Chiara Ferrau, beautifully sung by Peppino\u2019s daughter Aleza, and the spry folk classicism of \u201cLa Gazza Ladra.\u201d\n\nAfter a listen to Nine White Kites, It\u2019s no wonder that Acoustic Guitar says that D\u2019Agostino is \u201cone of the most capable composers among fingerstyle guitarists\u201d while the San Jose Mercury News notes his \u201cgift for writing emotionally evocative tunes.\u201d The title reflects the fact that \u201cmusic is weightless,\u201d D\u2019Agostino observes. \u201cBut if you think about it, it can create very deep and heavy feelings. The kite is very light, like music, but it also can evoke feelings. Plus it symbolizes a sense of freedom, and kites are universal, found all around the world.\u201d\n\nA native of Italy, D\u2019Agostino has made his considerable international mark as a musical artist on the guitar since he arrived in America a little over 25 years ago. The readers of Guitar Player voted him Best Acoustic Guitarist in 2007, and the following year in Acoustic Guitar\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Awards he won a Bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time for his 2002 release Every Step of The Way (tying with Leo Kottke, one of his prime inspirations) and another Bronze award as Fingerstyle Guitarist of the Year. But as said above, it\u2019s not just his talent that makes D\u2019Agostino so notable, but also what he does with it.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune praises his \u201cvirtuosity and complexity\u201d as well as his gift for composing \u201cmemorable melodies.\u201d He is also an \u201castonishing entertainer\u201d (Anchorage Daily News). Yet it\u2019s what Guitar One has noted as his \u201clyrical artistry\u201d and fellow master player Adrian Legg describes as the \u201cwarm humanity\u201d of his playing that has earned him the stature of being a \u201cphenom,\u201d as Jazziz raves.\n\nHow has D\u2019Agostino earned such high praise and honors? \u201cMusic is not only what you know musically, but also what you experience in life, because it is a reflection of our personalities and spirit,\u201d he explains. In his playing and writing one feels his heart, spirit, soul and essence as well as your own.\n\nHe began playing guitar at the age of 10 when he heard his cousin play in church. After D\u2019Agostino got a few lessons from the cousin, he embarked on a journey of self-study and further exploration on the guitar and in music that continues today. So in addition to his \u201ctechnical prowess\u201d (Guitar One), he displays a stunning stylistic range in his work that spans classical to pop music and incorporates a spectrum of folk, ethnic and world styles. From his teens into his twenties, D\u2019Agostino learned about and absorbed many musical colors and flavors, being so enthralled with all to know about music and his chosen instrument that he went AWOL one night from the Italian Army to catch a concert by some acoustic guitarists he admired.\n\nAfter making his recorded mark in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later \u2014 both discs collaborations with fellow players that set the stage for many to follow \u2014 he moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants and then clubs and concerts after a fellow musician introduced D\u2019Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records, and has since issued six more albums prior to Nine White Kites, the most recent being Made in Italy, a musical travelogue through the songs and composers of the country where he was born and came of age.\n\nHe has released the collaborations Classic/Steel (2001) with contemporary classical guitar master David Tanenbaum and Bayshore Road (2005) with his close friend and virtuoso electric player Stef Burns. D\u2019Agostino also performs and has recorded with the United Guitar Ensemble, which features his steel string guitar alongside eight nylon string classical masters.\n\nHe has also released three instructional/performance DVDs as well as the book New Acoustic Guitar (Warner Bros. Publications), and also designed his signature Seagull guitar with innovative guitar maker Robert Godin that won a Silver People\u2019s Choice Award for Acoustic Guitar of the Year from Acoustic Guitar magazine in 2008. A hot ticket live performer in North and South America and Europe, he charms audiences with performances that are captivating and full-blooded musical experiences.\n\n\u201cI play Brazilian music, Irish music, country music, blues, ragtime, classical,\u201d he says of just some of the many styles heard within what he creates. Inspired by such diverse players as Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, among many others, his influences also include the progressive rockers like Genesis, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant and Mike Oldfield he listened to in his teens and early adulthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my curiosity,\u201d D\u2019Agostino explains. \u201cA lot of people stay within a frame and say they play blues and they play blues all their life. And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not judging anyone. But the way my brain works I need to explore different styles and what\u2019s available there and what\u2019s possible and what others do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeppino writes wonderful guitar pieces,\u201d says Kottke of his onetime acolyte. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my favorite composers for this cranky instrument. Plus, he\u2019s a tone player. I love his sound\u2026 [he] gets the resin and the wood.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Agostino likens his musical approach to the culinary artistry of his native Italy. \u201cIf you only know about tomatoes, garlic and basil, you will only make a certain kind of sauce. But if you know about maybe thyme, parsley, onions and olives, you make a different kind of recipe. But you have to know how to mix those elements with discretion and elegance.\u201d The results provide a delectable and nutritious listening experience for music lovers of all tastes that brings D\u2019Agostino satisfaction that radiates throughout his self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d. For as he says, \u201cOur job as musicians is to try to do what we love.self-dubbed \u201cMinestrone music\u201d.

Their latest release\u202f'The Perplexed Sky'\u202f is a story of highs and lows; of intense relationships, of bliss, delusions and the resurfacing of demons. Singer/songwriter Jack Murray plays with the idea of self in today\u2019s world, examining how our own perceptions are different than how others see us. \u202f'The Perplexed Sky\u202f' was produced by J. Robbins, a prominent figure in the legendary DC music scene of the 80s and 90s, at Magpie Cage in Baltimore. J\u2019s previous work includes Jawbox and Government Issue (member) as well as Clutch, Against Me!, and Jawbreaker (recording and production) among many others. The album is available on translucent dark purple vinyl, CD, and all digital platforms.\n\nThe band\u2019s live shows are a mix of noise, melody and frustration. As a duo, Jack uses guitars with bass parts built-in, creating distinct bass and guitar sounds that feed into separate amplifiers. Influenced by bands such as The Wipers, Screaming Trees, REM, Agent Orange, Nirvana and the White Stripes, they are often described as ranging from surf punk to garage rock, alternative and even paisley underground. One promoter described their new album as \u201cdream grunge alt-punk\u201d while the album\u2019s producer J. Robbins said certain elements reminded him of post-punk band The Chameleons.\n\nThe band has its roots in Gainesville, FL where they released their first EP\u202f'Kakistocracy' (2015), recorded by Roger Lima (Less Than Jake). Shortly after, Jack moved to NYC where the band released their second EP\u202f'\u2026Or the Devil Will Get You'\u202f recorded at If and Only If Productions in Brooklyn as well as a limited 7\u2033 split on Leesta Vall Sound Recordings.

During a career spanning three decades he has not only injected every inch of his being into the music industry, traveling the length and breadth of the planet to spread his gospel, but he has also been responsible for setting up some of the most prominent platforms in the business and kickstarting the careers of numerous international stars. DJ T. has an unsurpassed depth of knowledge, an unrelenting passion for discovering and nurturing new talent and unflinching determination, which has been the catalyst behind a hugely influential career lasting over 25 years and counting\u2026\n\nBorn in Dusseldorf, DJ T. (real name Thomas Koch), relocated to Frankfurt with his family in the late 70s. During his formative years, he fell for the hypnotic grooves of disco, inspired by his parents\u2019 record collection. At the age of nine he was already completely enraptured by music and that love affair continues until this very day. He began an obsessive quest to collect music, feeding his soul with everything from disco and hi-nrg, through to early hip-hop and electro, soul, funk and R\u2019n\u2019B. The groovy, infectious rhythms of all those genres continue to permeate into the music he makes and plays today, providing an intrinsic part of his sound ethic.\n\nAround this time he took up breakdancing, compelled by the energy of hip-hop and early electro pioneers to push himself physically, channelling the energy of true body music, which remains part of his musical DNA. From body-popping and locking, he progressed into DJing, a discipline through which he could share his undying passion for music. T. started to play at private parties in his hometown, soon picking up his first professional gigs. The late eighties proved to be a pivotal moment in his life as acid house swept through Europe, landing in Frankfurt and taking over with the launch of Sven V\u00e4th\u2019s legendary Omen club in 1988. The first wave of house and techno took hold and T. was there at the forefront, absorbing all the fresh new sounds from Chicago, Detroit and the UK. He picked up a residency at the infamous Music Hall and held residencies at countless clubs across the city during the next 10 years from Plastik and Dorian Gray to The Box. During this fertile period, DJ T. established himself as a reputable purveyor of electronic music and, by the end of the nineties, he was one of Frankfurt\u2019s best-known selectors.\n\nIn 1989 DJ T. tapped into another side of his creative energy to set up Groove Magazine. Identifying a gap in the market and fuelled by a need to satisfy his own desire for specialised music journalism, which focused on his interests \u2013 namely, underground dance music. Under his leadership the magazine was launched into the public\u2019s consciousness and he guided Groove to become one of Germany\u2019s premier dance music publications, which it still is today. He served as editor and publisher for 15 years and took the brand on the road with numerous tours and club events in and around Germany, not only on the road but across the airwaves with a weekly radio show.\n\nAfter a decade of events under the Groove banner, DJ T:injected all of his experience into the launch of his own venue. In 1999 he teamed up with a friend, Patrik Dechent, to open his own intimate club space, Monza. Over the next five years his creative vision and unique music programming kept the club buoyant and even spawned an Ibiza franchise; presenting the very best house music to a discerning, open-minded crowd. DJ T.\u2019s ambitions pushed him forward into yet another successful venture in 2002 when he collaborated with five friends to set up Get Physical, a seminal label which has received universal respect since its conception and has been responsible for launching the careers of a long list of global stars. Though he left in 2010, T. still A&Rs for the label, lending his remarkable ear to the continued success of the label.\n\nAs well as DJing, event organisation, journalism, club ownership, A&Ring and label management, T. has also produced an impressive catalogue of releases; both singles and albums, which demonstrate his ability to create a diverse range of sounds, drawing on his extensive experience of collecting and playing music. In the early stages of his production career, from debut EP, \u2018Monsterbaze\u2019, with Steve Bug in 2000, to his first album \u2018Boogie Playground\u2019 in 2005, DJ T. was injecting all the music he was surrounded by in his formative years into creating hypnotic house grooves, With three albums under his belt, he has proven time and again that he can make body music with soul, unleashing deep enchanting rhythms influenced by a wide range of genres. On his most recent album, T. partnered up with Stefan Eichinger (aka LOPAZZ) to create a long-player that explored his songwriting capabilities and allowed him to expand his creative boundaries. Entitled \u2018Pleasure Principle\u2019, it remains one of his most seminal projects to date and spawned a hugely popular series of remix EPs, featuring contributions from the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of contemporary house and techno including Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, Tale Of Us, Art Department and Jamie Jones & Lee Foss. DJ T. himself has also become synonymous with remixes, putting out numerous reworks for an array of artists and labels over the last decade.\n\nBeyond the production work, DJ T. has also been responsible for curating several key compilations over the years. In 2006 he released his debut commercial mix \u2018Body Language Vol.2\u2019, followed by \u2018fabric 51\u2019 in 2010, \u2018United Under The Ball \u2013 30 Years Of Disco\u2019 in 2011 and \u2018The House That Jack Built Vol 1 & 2\u2019 in 2012. In 2013 he celebrated 25 years of DJing with a very personal mix compilation, followed also by \u2018Body Language 15\u2019 and a collaboration with Defected and Strictly Rhythm to celebrate the latter\u2019s 25th anniversary. DJ T.\u2019s reputation for being a master selector has been cemented by these superlative collections of music, each of which has received widespread praise, often featuring many of T.\u2019s own edits of classic tracks.\n\nNow almost 30 years deep, with an extraordinary list of achievements behind him, T. shows no signs of slowing down, in fact his unrelenting drive and thirst for seeking out new avenues has led to several key changes in his circumstances recently. In 2015 T.\u2019s output has hit previously unexplored terrains, with music landing on labels such as AUS Music and Moon Harbour. Turning once again to his Chicago and jacking house roots, T.\u2019s latest tracks blend the old school styles with a modern sound ethic, focused around contemporary tech house and the dark and ravy sounds emanating out of the UK underground. In unison with new production partner Emanuel Satie - a talented newcomer from Frankfurt who now resides in Berlin.\n\nTwo years after he celebrated 25 years in the business with a world tour and numerous projects connected to the milestone event, DJ T. remains as enthusiastic about music as he was in his formative years. Creativity is at a high, his desire to spread music far and wide never wains and his artistry and dynamism as a DJ is unparalleled.", "otherInfo": "No other event info available"}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "AL1CE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8432226.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Fantasy, Dream, Rock", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "AL1CE is a multimedia performing arts rock group that fuses dance, surrealist art, video, world music, electronica and rock into a veritable broth of sound and vision.

Neatly avoiding pigeonholing, while embracing a myriad of different styles, his set creates a warm unique vibe of empathy on the dance floor.\n\nDoc's legendary 8 hour sets at Flammable Liquid, Sunday Love, to the most underground lofts, and warehouse parties know no colors, age or sexual orientation.

That's rare these days in a scene where there are sizable walls between the two ends of the dance music spectrum.\n\nWhile most star DJ's are one-note musicians sticking to a single subgenera of music, Doc' s live sets bring many styles of music as well as people together. In this age of specialized formats among DJ's and producers, what sets Martin apart from his peers is his ability to spin everything from deep house, acid, funk, tribal, and classics in a set, while having it all make sense. Doc is one of the most sought after DJs in America. Constantly touring, he can be found playing records everywhere from England to New Zealand, and everywhere in between. As the first West Coast DJ to ever hold many residencies in New York, he continues to spread the gospel according to Doc.\n\nNow residing in L.A. he has begun to spread his vibe through making music in the studio as well as playing it.

In the summer of 2017, Tim spent time in the studio with producer and close friend Marcus Paquin, narrowing down the over 30 songs into a single, cohesive record. The work they produced represents Tim at his core - a wonderfully imaginative songwriter, a thoughtful poet, a playful arranger, and a technically profound musician.

They toured with some of the most recognizable names in heavy metal, including MOTORHEAD, CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, BLACK LABEL SOCIETY, TYPE O NEGATIVE and SHADOWS FALL. Their rock n' roll music was featured in the movie \"School of Rock\" and on the MTV television shows \"Homewreckers\" and \"Viva La Bam.\" It was JUST JOE and then some.\n\nAn inside linebacker in college, Joe helped get their message cross over to the sporting world. BNS songs were featured on UFC and ESPN, and even the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment giant, THE BIG SHOW tapped Joe's soaring vocals with his bandmates for Show's entrance song, \"Crank It Up.\" From college learning to worldwide touring to crossover media. It was JUST JOE.\n\nDuring downtimes with BNS, Joe took up his piano and played clubs under the monicker BRAND NEW JOE. When he split from BNS, Joe developed a repertoire of more than 2500+ cover songs, ranging from FRANK SINATRA to METALLICA and everything imaginable in-between and has played to sold out houses up and down the east coast as JUST JOE.\n\nIn 2009, he hooked up with former BNS guitarist BRIAN \"SLIDER\" AZZOTO and formed ELEPHANT MOUNTAIN.

In adolescence and youth, nightclub listeners of heavy metal bands, Iron Maiden and Megadeth, their main influences. F\u00e1bio also liked to draw, and he painted t-shirts with drawings of the covers of the discs. Perhaps he has inherited his artistic vein from his family since he has been a movie actor in Europe, his best style of violin playing and making woodwork and his mother very much like to paint paintings. He is also a sports lover like Surf and in 1986 decided to create a fashion wave and express his art on t-shirts. He became a fashion designer, a designer brand, and produced fashion shows at renowned venues such as the Victoria Pub located in a neighborhood of the City of S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1991, he moved to the City of Mogi das Cruzes, where he made some visits, \"Surf Shops\" that sold his products. Continued to produce fashion shows and other events with rock bands and other styles, we can cite a landmark event in the City that was produced with the reggae band Cidade Negra. In 1995, he returned to meet the music and decided the school. Six years after his studies, he created a first rock band titled \"Brave Heart\", his ex-wife and brother also joined the band, played songs and some covers of Megadeth, Black Sabath, among others. They even came up with a small EP, but nothing professional. They did some parties in bars and schools of region, but in 1997, the pair of musicians embarked for Japan, where also they presented new songs like songs but without any performances. In 1998, when returning to Brazil, F\u00e1bio started to teach driums lessons in two schools in S\u00e3o Paulo. He returned to Japan even more than 3 times later. After a period of travel and learning, only year 2007 again formed a new band, this time with the name of \"Surfer of Christ\". An idea of ??the name came from the sport he practiced, surf, and \"Christ\", for he became a follower of Jesus' teachings.The band was a mix of rock and reggae and lasted about 2 years, recording only a single demo with five tracks and performed in some public places, squares, events and in public schools and churches of the region of S\u00e3o Paulo and Greater S\u00e3o Paulo . As F\u00e1bio was always fond of the Heavy Metal style, due to his influences, in 2009 he formed the band called \"No Thanxs\". They recorded a single and two CDs, taking on good projections due to the highlight of the remarkable, heavy riffs and inspiring lyrics of the songs. The band made small and large presentations in S\u00e3o Paulo and other cities, among them we can mention the opening of the show by the former vocalist of rock band Raimundos, Rodolfo Abrantes. \"No Thanxs\" participated in interviews on radios, newspapers and some local television channels. In 2012, F\u00e1bio announces the end of the band, for personal reasons and incompatibility of ideas. That same year, he traveled to the United States to improve his English skills and also to do a theological study at the Dunamis Resource Center led by Pr. Dennis Walker and Israel Silva. In February of 2013, he returned to Brazil and began a new stage in his career as guitarist and vocalist of a solo project titled \"Jesus Freack Rock\" starting the new compositions. All songs are of their own making, mostly written in English and Portuguese, because English is a universal language, and are based on the Holy Bible and also on true facts and themes of current reality. The presentations are enhanced in shows, festivals, churches, schools and events in general with the goal of bringing the true message of the gospel to the knowledge of people, whether Christian or not, emphasizing freedom, without religious dogmas and doctrines, nor created standards by some leaders. At the end of the year 2013, he returned to the United States for another season of presentations and divulgation of his new work. Touring the Cities of Las Vegas and Henderson and among some famous places, we can mention: - Mega Store Samash Music - Money Plays - BB's Club House, where he performed at the event in commemoration of US veterans with the special participation of ex- guitarist of thrash metal band Megadeth, Jeff Young. He then traveled to Mexico City to perform at the Veracruzano Social and Cultural Center at La Caverna Rock Bar. Upon returning to Brazil in 2014, the project was renamed \"Jesushed\", a more original name with a profound meaning : \"Jesus Shed.\" In 2015, he released the CD Born Again, in 2017 the EP 360 and in October 2018 the EP \"End Times\", that is currently on tour.Since 2016 \"Jesushed\" had 3 different line up, and currently has the following members: F\u00e1bio Curtis - Vocal and Guitar, Wellington Ferreira - lead guitar, Maicon Martins - Bass and Jos\u00e9 Carlos - Drums.", "otherInfo": "Release of new track called Brasil, sistema falido."}, {"Address": "", "Artist": "Pancho Barraza ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6145939.jpeg", "Coordinates": "", "Date": "Sat May 30 2020", "EventDate": "2020-05-30", "Genre": "Pop", "Time": "11:00 PM UTC", "Venue": "Live Stream", "moreBioInfo": "PANCHO BARRAZA Talentoso, creativo, compositor, int\u00e9rprete, m\u00fasico y arreglista\u2026 Hablar de Pancho Barraza es referirse a un artista que naci\u00f3 para la m\u00fasica, alguien que a lo largo de su trayectoria ha sabido ganarse un lugar muy especial en el gusto del p\u00fablico gracias a sus creaciones. Francisco Javier Barraza Rodr\u00edguez, a quien todo el mundo conoce como Pancho Barraza, es originario de Juan Jos\u00e9 R\u00edos, Sinaloa. Desde muy peque\u00f1o mostr\u00f3 una gran inclinaci\u00f3n hacia la m\u00fasica, aunque al principio casi nadie cre\u00eda en \u00e9l. Fue hasta la edad de 22 a\u00f1os, mientras era maestro de m\u00fasica en la secundaria del poblado de Villa Uni\u00f3n, que se inicia de manera profesional al formar parte del grupo vers\u00e1til Karisma como vocalista y bajista. Al mismo tiempo, integra el coro de la iglesia del pueblo. Al poco tiempo, su talento y don para componer, lo llevan a la banda Los Recoditos, donde lo designan como su voz principal logrando destacar con sus propias canciones. Adem\u00e1s, se convierte en el creador del estilo rom\u00e1ntico en la m\u00fasica de banda y es as\u00ed que Recoditos empieza a sonar en las radios del Pac\u00edfico gracias a los temas de Pancho. Es tanta su inquietud por crear y la confianza que se tiene como cantante, compositor y m\u00fasico que en 1995 se separa de Los Recoditos para lanzarse como solista y forma su propia banda. La bautiza con el nombre de \u2018Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019. De ah\u00ed en adelante, los nombres de Pancho Barraza y su banda Santa Mar\u00eda empiezan a escucharse con gran insistencia por todo el Pac\u00edfico y parte de Estados Unidos con temas como \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d, \u201cIgnorarte Mis L\u00e1grimas\u201d, \u201cGabriela De Mis Amores\u201d, \u201cPasi\u00f3n De Amor\u201d y \u201cSanta Mar\u00eda Banda\u201d. Todos estos \u00e9xitos vienen incluidos en su primera producci\u00f3n como solista titulada \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d. En abril del 96, lanza su segundo disco compacto titulado \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, del que destacan canciones como \u201cMi Amor Y Mi Agon\u00eda\u201d, \u201cUna Tarde Como Cualquiera\u201d, la titular \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, \u201cTe Amo Y Te Lo Digo\u201d y otras. Es tanta su capacidad musical, que al a\u00f1o siguiente decide incursionar en la m\u00fasica ranchera. Forma su mariachi Santa Mar\u00eda y graba el \u00e1lbum \u201cInv\u00e9ntame Un Amor\u201d, del que se desprenden los \u00e9xitos \u201cPero La Recuerdo\u201d, \u201cSolitario Entre La Gente\u201d y \u201cCantares De Medianoche\u201d. Tanta fue la aceptaci\u00f3n que tuvo Pancho Barraza con este disco que los lugares donde se presentaba siempre estaban llenos a reventar, por lo que merecidamente se gan\u00f3 el titulo de \u201c\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u201d. En 1998, se convierte en \u201cEl Vagabundo Que Te Ama\u201d y con \u00e9ste, que fue su nuevo CD, lanza un nuevo hit a ritmo de banda: \u201cMi Enemigo El Amor\u201d, y uno m\u00e1s a ritmo de cumbia: \u201cAquella Morena\u201d. Adem\u00e1s, por primera vez graba un corrido: \u201cHistoria De Amores\u201d. En junio de 1999, vuelve a sorprender con su producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cDel Camino A La Ciudad\u201d, un disco lleno de inspiraci\u00f3n y nostalgia por los momentos dificiles que pasa cualquier ser humano. De este nuevo trabajo musical se desprenden 12 temas en los que Pancho muestra su madurez art\u00edstica y humana, ya que incursiona al mismo tiempo en g\u00e9neros como la salsa, el bolero, la balada y la cumbia. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d es el disco que el \u2018\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u2019 lanza para comenzar el a\u00f1o 2000. Por primera vez en su exitosa carrera incluye temas de otros autores. Pero les imprime su muy peculiar estilo interpretativo como es el caso de \u201cUn Indio Quiere Llorar\u201d, \u201cMi Juramento\u201d, \u201cAy Amigo\u201d, y \u201cLas Rejas No Matan\u201d, entre otros. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d tambi\u00e9n cuenta con temas de su propia inspiraci\u00f3n, como \u201cCompa\u00f1era M\u00eda\u201d, \u201cLola La Bailera\u201d, \u201cNo Va A Matarme Tu Amor\u201d y \u201cLa Vaca Pinta\u201d. Para finales de ese mismo a\u00f1o, saca \u201cUna Noche Cualquiera\u201d una producci\u00f3n musical en la que vuelve a demostrar el porqu\u00e9 se ha convertido en uno de los \u2018cantautores\u2019 preferidos del p\u00fablico, al interprerar canciones como \u201cCon M\u00fasica Rom\u00e1ntica\u201d, \u201cEl Paso De La Iguana\u201d, \u201cH\u00e1blame Claro\u201d, \u201cDebajo De Los Laureles\u201d y la que da t\u00edtulo a este disco. Pero el talento y la creatividad de Pancho no deja de fluir y para mediados del 2000, casi a la par, lanza dos producciones. Una de estas es \u201cFormas De Vivir\u201d, con la que expone su gran versatilidad como autor, int\u00e9rprete y arreglista. Se trata de un disco completo, con acompa\u00f1amiento de su propio mariachi. Incluye temas a ritmo de cumbia como \u201cTienes Que Volver\u201d, \u201cRegresa Por Favor\u201d, \u201cMi Dama\u201d y \u201cSi Por Amor\u201d. La otra producci\u00f3n a ritmo de banda se llama \u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d. Por primera vez incluye una bachata (\u201cBurbuja De Amor\u201d) y un tema a ritmo de soca (\u201cPu tun tun\u201d), cumbias (\u201cLa Roncona\u201d, \u201cEl Muerto Se Fue De Rumba\u201d y \u201cEl Toro Baquet\u00f3n\u201d) y las rancheras que tan bien le van (\u201cArr\u00e1ncame La Vida\u201d, \u201cNo Volver\u00e9\u201d, \u201cCuando Nadie Te Quiera\u201d, \u201cA La Luz De Un Farol\u201d, \u201c\u00c1nimas Que No Amanezca\u201d y \u201cEl Dinero\u201d) y una balada (\u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d). Por su trayectoria y sus logros, su nombre es muy importante para quienes realmente gustan de la m\u00fasica popular. Pancho Barraza comenz\u00f3 el nuevo milenio con la alegre producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza Y Mujeriego\u201d, grabada bajo el sello que lo ha visto crecer: Discos Musart/ Balboa Records. Con \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza y Mujeriego\u201d, sigui\u00f3 en los primeros sitios de popularidad, sonando fuertemente en las estaciones de radio y sorprendiendo a propios y extra\u00f1os por su mezcla de ritmos y gran calidad art\u00edstica, con \u00e9xitos tan inolvidables como \u201cTe Esperar\u00e9\u201d, que contin\u00faa en la programaci\u00f3n de muchas emisoras hasta siete a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno. As\u00ed se proyecta el talento de este artista excepcional, cuyo cat\u00e1logo crece cada d\u00eda en sus tres facetas principales: compositor, cantante y m\u00fasico. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n lo confirman sus grabaciones m\u00e1s recientes para Discos Musart/ Balboa Records: \u201cEn Vivo\u201d, donde se dio el lujo de que el p\u00fablico presente le hiciera un coro formado por miles de gargantas; y \u201cPancho Barraza Con El Alma En La Mano\u201d, un \u00e1lbum en que volvi\u00f3 al estilo ranchero que tanto le gusta, obviamente acompa\u00f1ado de mariachi. Ahora mismo, en este 2008 lo m\u00e1s reciente de su discograf\u00eda en Estados Unidos es su \u00e1lbum \u201cLa M\u00e1s Hermosa\u201d, donde acompa\u00f1ado de su propia banda presenta 12 nuevas canciones, todas escritas por el \u00e9l mismo. El primer corte promocional de este CD es la balada banda \u201cTe Voy A Olvidar\u201d.

The reflective piano ballad \u201cFriend\u201d opens the album with Witt sifting through feelings of attraction for someone she knows should be just a pal and not a lover, while the aching vocal showcase \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d pairs torchy piano with taut electric guitar accents as Witt muses over the ways in which we edit our pasts to fit the present. Revisionary history, indeed \u2014 the album title comes from a lyric in that song.\n\n\u201cWe can constantly be revising how we remember things, and maybe that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Witt, whose TV credits include The Sopranos, Friday Night Lights and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s how we move on.\u201d\n\nProduced by Ben Folds, Revisionary History was years in the making. Some of the songs date back to the mid-\u201900s, which gave her plenty of time to hone them in concert before heading to Folds\u2019 studio in Nashville, where she recorded the album in two week-long chunks in the spring and late fall of 2013.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got such a unique and specific vision for how those songs should best be presented,\u201d Witt says of Folds. \u201cI had no doubt that he was going to bring to it his own vision for the sound of each song, but he also wanted it to be a truthful reflection of what I do. The record sounds very much like me.\u201d\n\nWitt credits Folds for digging into the essence of each song for musical arrangements that sometimes brought out their hidden sides: the folky stomp on \u201cBlind,\u201d for example, highlighted the rootsy touches in a song Witt had been performing for years, while the mournful trumpet and marching drumbeat perfectly captured the mood on \u201cDown,\u201d a tune inspired by the smart but troubled character Witt played on Season Five of the Emmy-nominated FX series Justified, featuring the Emmy-nominated New York rapper and actor T.O.N.E-z\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it all put together, it made me cry,\u201d Witt says. \u201cAt the end, when the trumpet comes in, it sounds like a soul making its way up.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl-power anthem \u201cAbout Me,\u201d which shows the influence of Folds and Billy Joel in the robust piano and Witt\u2019s defiant determined vocals; or the lush, sultry \u201960s-style pop tune \u201cTheme From Pasadena,\u201d which Witt wrote with Folds for the movie Cold Turkey (Witt starred opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the indie drama, which was originally to be called Pasadena). In fact, Revisionary History boasts such an array of sounds and styles that there\u2019s no pigeonholing Witt as a musician.\n\n\u201cI love all different types of music, so the songs that I come up with and am drawn to when I\u2019m writing are naturally all over the place,\u201d says Witt, whose movie credits include 88 Minutes with Al Pacino and Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt has been a music lover since she was a little girl growing up in Worcester, Mass. She began playing piano when she was 7, competing in international piano competitions into her teen years. After she moved to Los Angeles at 14, she supported herself by playing in the lobby lounge of the Beverly Wilshire hotel until she landed her first regular acting job on the CBS show Cybil when she was 16. It took a few more years before she began consistently writing her own songs, and it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she started performing them. Her first gig was opening for Jimmy Webb at a benefit in New York. Moving from standards and show tunes to original songs was a big leap for Witt.\n\n\u201cThere was a considerable fear factor,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an actor doing theater and doing live television, it wasn\u2019t about performing for people. It was about performing my own music. That\u2019s incredibly vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWitt\u2019s fears that audiences wouldn\u2019t respond proved very much unfounded, and the vulnerability of opening up to strangers helped her make the all-important connection that turned them into fans. 'The most that I can hope for is telling these stories that are incredibly personal, but saying them in a way that somebody else can relate to their own experiences,\" says Witt.\n\nbio:\n\nAlicia Witt has had a 3-decade long career, starting with her acting debut in David Lynch\u2019s classic \u2018Dune\u2019.\n\nWitt was most recently seen on Season 4 of the Emmy-award winning Showtime series \u2018House of Lies\u2019 opposite Don Cheadle.

Alicia played Wendy Crowe, the smart and sexy paralegal sister of crime lord Darryl Crowe (Michael Rapaport) who takes matters into her own hands to bring him to justice in the Season 5 finale. Last summer she appeared at the Geffen Playhouse in the Los Angeles debut of Tony-nominated Neil Labute play \u2018reasons to be pretty\u2019. The four-hander also starred Amber Tamblyn, Shawn Hatosy and Nick Gehlfuss, and was directed by Randall Arney, Artistic Director of the Geffen.\n\nTo viewers of the Hallmark Channel, Alicia may be best known for her Christmas films \u2018Christmas at Cartwright\u2019s\u2019 (2014) and \u2018A Very Merry Mix-Up\u2019 (2013), which have become their highest rated of all time.\n\nIn 2013, Alicia appeared opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the independent family dramedy 'Cold Turkey', in a performance which NY Daily News critic David Edelstein hailed as one of the best of 2013, and garnered the headline \u2018See Cold Turkey For Alicia Witt\u2019s Performance\u2019 in the Village Voice. Also released in 2013 was the film 'I Do', which had a nationwide theatrical release after screening at 25 festivals worldwide and winning 10 awards. Alicia has two songs featured in this film as well.\n\nAlicia is an accomplished singer/songwriter. A classically trained pianist, for the past 7 years she has been performing her original piano-driven rock all across the world, and has opened for Ben Folds Five, Jimmy Webb and John Fullbright.

That same year she played Detective Nola Falacci opposite Chris Noth on NBC\u2019s 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' for half a season, taking over for Julianne Nicholson while she was on maternity leave.\n\nOther roles include Paramount\u2019s 'Last Holiday' with Queen Latifah and Timothy Hutton, and New Line\u2019s critically acclaimed film \u2018The Upside of Anger\u2019, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite Joan Allen & Kevin Costner. She also starred in Warner Bros\u2019 hit romantic comedy, 'Two Weeks Notice', opposite Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\n\nWitt appeared on-stage in fall 2006 at London\u2019s Royal Court Theatre in Terry Johnson\u2019s 'Piano/Forte'.

In 1998, she starred in Columbia Tristar\u2019s hit horror movie, 'Urban Legend.\n\nOn television, Witt starred for four seasons as Cybill Shepherd\u2019s daughter Zoey on the hit CBS sitcom \u2018Cybill\u2019. She also guest starred on the phenomenally successful HBO series, \u2018The Sopranos\u2019, and the Emmy award winning \u2018Ally McBeal\u2019, in which she sang with Randy Newman. Witt combined her acting talents with her skills as a pianist in the romantic comedy, 'Playing Mona Lisa'.\n\nAlicia made her directorial debut with the short film 'Belinda\u2019s Swan Song', which she also wrote. The film premiered at the 2006 Rhode Island International Film Festival and was screened at 9 additional festivals around the world, including the Los Angeles International Short Film Festival.\n\nShe also appeared in 'Mr. Holland\u2019s Opus', opposite Richard Dreyfuss, as clarinet player Gertrude, as well as 'Four Rooms' (Miramax) with Tim Roth, Madonna, and Lili Taylor, and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Allison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell.

Their musical approach clashed with the then dominating ballads and happy pop tunes that filled the radio and TV programs, in offering dark and moody lyrics.\n\nfue un grupo mexicano de rock originalmente conformado por Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez (voz y guitarra), Alfonso Andr\u00e9 (bater\u00eda y percusiones), Salvador \"Sabo\" Romo (bajo) y Diego Herrera (teclados y saxof\u00f3n). Su primera presentaci\u00f3n fue el 11 de abril de 1987 en Rockotitl\u00e1n. La expectaci\u00f3n creada en el underground rockero mexicano fue tanta que mucha gente se qued\u00f3 fuera del recinto. Si bien Caifanes era un grupo nuevo, la anterior banda de Sa\u00fal, Alejandro Marcovich y Alfonso Andr\u00e9, llamada Las Ins\u00f3litas Im\u00e1genes de Aurora, ten\u00eda una amplia base de fan\u00e1ticos.\n\nSu primer disco, Caifanes (a veces nombrado tambi\u00e9n M\u00e1tenme porque me muero, Volumen 1 o Disco negro) sali\u00f3 a la venta en agosto de 1988 y el sencillo M\u00e1tenme porque me muero fue su primer \u00e9xito, seguido por Viento y La negra Tomasa, una versi\u00f3n de una cumbia escrita por el m\u00fasico cubano Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez Fiffe. El disco mostraba claras influencias del grupo brit\u00e1nico The Cure. Gustavo Cerati particip\u00f3 como m\u00fasico invitado en la grabaci\u00f3n del \u00e1lbum tocando la guitarra en La bestia humana. Este \u00e1lbum fue precedido por un EP con tres canciones producido con la intenci\u00f3n de probar la aceptaci\u00f3n del grupo entre la posible audiencia; el resultado fue la venta de m\u00e1s de trescientas mil copias y, por lo tanto, la grabaci\u00f3n del primer LP.\n\nSu segundo disco fue Volumen II, pero es mejor conocido como El Diablito. Esto se debe a un error de impresi\u00f3n: en la portada aparece un letrero borroso que dice el diablito y es considerado el \"verdadero\" t\u00edtulo del disco, adem\u00e1s el dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico muestra el dibujo de un diablito de loter\u00eda. El guitarrista argentino-mexicano Alejandro Marcovich se integra al grupo; su presencia result\u00f3 notoria desde un principio y su estilo fue fundamental en lo que comenzar\u00eda a ser el sonido de Caifanes.\n\nEn El Diablito aparece una de las canciones m\u00e1s populares del grupo, La c\u00e9lula que explota. Esta canci\u00f3n, mezcla de balada rockera con m\u00fasica de mariachi, apunta muy claramente la direcci\u00f3n que Caifanes habr\u00eda de tomar a partir de ese punto: una mezcla de rock con elementos de la ampl\u00edsima gama de estilos que comprende la m\u00fasica popular mexicana.\n\nEn 1992 se edita El Silencio que incluye gran parte del repertorio cl\u00e1sico de Caifanes, como No dejes que ..., Mi\u00e9rcoles de Ceniza, Nubes y Nos vamos juntos. Cuando este disco sali\u00f3 a la venta el grupo ya era un \u00e9xito en M\u00e9xico, Centroam\u00e9rcia, algunos pa\u00edses de Sudam\u00e9rica y entre la comunidad hispana de Estados Unidos. En agosto de 1992 llenaron por completo el Hollywood Palladium de Los \u00c1ngeles. En 1993 hicieron lo mismo en el Palacio de los Deportes de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, haza\u00f1a que ning\u00fan otro grupo de rock mexicano hab\u00eda logrado hasta el momento; con dicho concierto Sabo Romo y Diego Herrera se despidieron de la agrupaci\u00f3n.\n\nAl llegar 1994, Caifanes queda reducido a un tr\u00edo conformado por Sa\u00fal, Alfonso y Alejandro. Juntos dan forma al \u00faltimo \u00e1lbum de los Caifanes, El nervio del volc\u00e1n. Se eligen como sencillos las canciones Afuera, Aqu\u00ed no es as\u00ed y Ayer me dijo un ave. Su presencia en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n crece y es seguida muy de cerca por los noticiarios de MTV Latino para quien realizaron un Unplugged y donde se documentaron tanto el creciente \u00e9xito internacional del grupo (por ejemplo, en esos d\u00edas abrieron el concierto de los Rolling Stones en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico y participaron en el festival WOMAD, organizado por Peter Gabriel) como las crecientes diferencias entre Hern\u00e1ndez y Marcovich (en un reportaje Sa\u00fal le pregunta a Alejandro \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tenemos en com\u00fan?\" y Marc\u00f3vich responde sarc\u00e1sticamente: \"\u00bfEl n\u00famero de cromosomas?\"). Caifanes ofreci\u00f3 su \u00faltimo concierto el 18 de agosto de 1995 en la ciudad de San Luis Potos\u00ed.\n\nTras la desintegraci\u00f3n de Caifanes, Hern\u00e1ndez se dedica a recuperarse de un mal cr\u00f3nico en sus cuerdas vocales, e invita a Alfonso Andr\u00e9 (bater\u00eda), Federico Fong (bajo) y Jos\u00e9 Manuel Aguilera (guitarra) a formar un taller musical llamado Jaguares.\n[editar]\n\nEstilo\n\nAunque en un principio la m\u00fasica de Caifanes parec\u00eda ser simplemente una versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol de la m\u00fasica de The Cure, la inclusi\u00f3n de La negra Tomasa en el repertorio del grupo no era casual: Hern\u00e1ndez y Romo tienen ra\u00edces en colonias populares de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Sin embargo, Caifanes no volvi\u00f3 a apropiarse tan marcadamente de un estilo musical distinto del rock; por el contrario, incorpor\u00f3 elementos de la m\u00fasica popular mexicana en el esquema general de \u00e9ste.\n\nSi bien en El diablito la mayor parte de las canciones puede ser calificada simplemente como rock, las letras comienzan a tomar elementos populares (como la integraci\u00f3n total del dicho De noche todos los gatos son pardos en la canci\u00f3n hom\u00f3nima) y con La c\u00e9lula que explota se marca en gran medida el estilo cl\u00e1sico de Caifanes: letras demandantes y po\u00e9ticas y m\u00fasica a caballo entre el rock y la m\u00fasica mexicana. La presencia de Alejandro Marcovich, a partir de este disco se vuelve fundamental en el sonido del grupo, a tal grado que para muchos fan\u00e1ticos la diferencia principal entre Caifanes y Jaguares consiste en el estilo del guitarrista.\n\nLa c\u00e9lula que explota construida como una balada rock con arreglos de mariachi, es la primera de una serie de amalgamas. En El silencio las fusiones tocan de nuevo la m\u00fasica con una fuerte cadencia r\u00edtmica que en M\u00e9xico se tilda de guapachosa (Nubes, Hasta morir, Para que no digas que no pienso en ti), pero tambi\u00e9n la banda (Piedra), e inluso aparece una versi\u00f3n un son veracruzano, Mariquita, donde se combinan las tradicionales jaranas con las guitarras el\u00e9ctricas de Marcovich. Por \u00faltimo, en El nervio del volc\u00e1n experiementaron con r\u00edtmicas ind\u00edgenas (Afuera), dieron un toque de bolero a las percusiones de Ayer me dijo un ave y construyeron La llorona sobre el vals tradicional del mismo nombre.\n\nEs importante remarcar que aunque el estilo de Caifanes se define por sus fusiones entre rock y m\u00fasica tradicional, la mayor parte de su m\u00fasica es simplemente rock, inserto en la tradici\u00f3n musical hispanoamericana iniciada con en el rock argentino y que incorpora letras barrocas ancladas en la tradici\u00f3n po\u00e9tica de la regi\u00f3n. Las letras de Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez est\u00e1n construidas, en su mayor\u00eda, con base en figuras muy complejas, dif\u00edciles de interpetar, sin necesidad de rimas y son fuertemente l\u00edricas. Las poqu\u00edsimas letras escritas por Alejandro Marcovich o por la mancuerna Hern\u00e1ndez/Marcovich siguen el mismo patr\u00f3n.\n[editar]\n\nIntegrantes\n\n* Sa\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez (1987-1995, voz y guitarra)\n* Alfonso Andr\u00e9 (1987-1995, bater\u00eda y percusiones)\n* Diego Herrera (1987-1993, teclados, saxof\u00f3n y jarana)\n* Alejandro Marc\u00f3vich (1989-1995, guitarra y requinto jarocho)\n* Salvador \"Sabo\" Romo (1987-1993, bajo)\n\n[editar]\n\nDiscograf\u00eda\n\n* Caifanes (1988)\n* Caifanes.

Heavily influenced by Nebraska's thriving red dirt country scene, \"Shadow Lake Sessions\" is the culmination of a personal journey for husband and wife duo K.C. and Ali Mumy, who lead Kali Indiana.\n\nTheir tight, interwoven harmonic sound is reminiscent of classic country and bluegrass music but with modern country rock instrumentals. K.C. and Ali\u2019s love for one another shines through on the new E.P. in songs like \"Call Her,\u201d sure to be the first dance wedding song of the summer. A song to raise a glass to at the end of the night is \"Tennesse's Gotta,\u201d a boot-stomping barn burner sing-along about long days when you just need a tall glass.\n\nK.C. and Ali have been collaborating on songwriting since forming Kali Indiana in late 2017. K.C. grew up in Michigan on classic rock and old school country, before moving to the California coast where he played before making his way to the Midwest. Ali sang in Indiana church and school choirs while writing her own music and dreaming of becoming a country music star. When they met and fell in love, the two combined K.C.'s quintessentially country sound with Ali's dynamite power vocals and the resulting harmonies are something only a husband and wife could create.\n\nKali Indiana's E.P. is brought to life in collaboration with lead guitarist Joey Bastian (Omaha, NE), bassist Michael Fernando (Johnson City, TN), and drummer B.J. Conway (Des Moines, IA). The band's second album builds on the success of their self-titled original E.P., streaming now on all platforms. Kali Indiana puts on a high-energy show with something for everyone, taking crowd requests.

The Crowes are listed at #92 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of hard rock\".\n\nAt the time of their 1990 debut, the kind of rock & roll the Black Crowes specialize in was out of style. Only Guns N' Roses came close to approximating a vintage Stones-style raunch, but they were too angry and jagged to pull it off completely. The Black Crowes replicated that Stonesy swagger and Faces boogie perfectly. Vocalist Chris Robinson appropriated the sound and style of vintage Rod Stewart while guitarist Rich Robinson fused Keith Richards' lean attack with Ron Wood's messy rhythmic sense. At their best, the Black Crowes echo classic rock without slavishly imitating their influences.\n\nThe Robinson brothers originally formed the Black Crowes in Georgia in 1984. By the time of their 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker, the group comprised Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar), Johnny Colt (bass), Jeff Cease (guitar), and Steve Gorman (drums). \"Jealous Again,\" the first single from Shake Your Money Maker, was a moderate hit but it was the band's cover of Otis Redding's \"Hard to Handle\" that made the group a multi-platinum success. \"Hard to Handle\" climbed its way into the Top 40, propelling the album into the Top Ten. The acoustic ballad \"She Talks to Angels\" became the band's second Top 40 hit in the spring of 1991. Shake Your Money Maker would eventually sell over three million copies.\n\nThe Black Crowes delivered their second album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in the spring of 1992, adding new lead guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch. It entered the charts at number one, but it didn't have as many hit singles as the debut; none of the singles cracked the Top 40 and only \"Remedy\" and \"Thorn in My Pride\" made the Top 100. Nevertheless, the band established themselves as a popular concert attraction that summer, selling out theaters across America. The Black Crowes' third album, Amorica, arrived in late 1994. Amorica debuted in the Top Ten, but none of the singles from the album made the charts; even though the record went gold, it slipped off the charts in early 1995.\n\nThree Snakes & One Charm, the group's fourth album, was released in July of 1996. The album entered the charts at number 15, but it quickly slipped out of the Top 50. Nevertheless, the album received the best reviews of any Crowes album since The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. Guitarist Marc Ford was fired from the Black Crowes in August, 1997; two years later, the group returned with By Your Side. In mid-2000, the band collaborated with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on the double-disc Live at the Greek, an eclectic mix of newly recorded Zeppelin covers and additional classic blues cuts. A Tribute to a Work in Progress: Greatest Hits 1990-1999, a 16-track best-of compilation was also released in mid-2000. The Don Was-produced Lions appeared in spring 2001, and a summer tour with Oasis -- the Tour of Brotherly Love -- followed in June. But all was apparently not well with the group, in January of 2002 the band announced that they were on hiatus. Drummer Steve Gorman was fired from the band, and Chris Robinson announced his intentions for a solo career.\n\nThe Black Crowes have since reunited. All members circa 1992 are back, with the addition of one of their previous bassists, Sven Pipien, and harmony singers Mona Lisa Young and Charity White. They are enjoying a renaissance within the group as well as with their longtime fan base and have been consistently touring since formally reuniting in March 2005. In November of 2007, it was announced that North Mississippi Allstar guitarist Luther Dickinson formally joined the band, replacing Paul Stacey.
