IDJLEX\u2019s undeniable skills as a turntablist solidified his popularity laying down the foundation for a career which twenty-five years later shows no sign of slowing down.

On her new EP Revival, the 26-year-old singer/songwriter expands on the sound she first honed as a teenager\u2014a piano-driven brand of folk-pop recently revealed in her surprise hit single \u201cDear Love\u201d and in opening up for legendary \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d singer Don McLean in New York City. The follow-up to her 2016 EP Veracity, Revival marks a deliberate return to the sparsely adorned sensibilities of Marsh\u2019s early work. Although Veracity mostly delivered an elaborately arranged breed of electro-pop, it was the stripped-back closing track \u201cDear Love\u201d that emerged as Marsh\u2019s breakthrough. Prominently featured on an episode of NCIS: New Orleans, the ukulele-laced ballad landed on a host of curated Spotify playlists, amassed over 5 million streams on the platform, and ultimately inspired Marsh to rethink her sonic approach. \u201cLittle by little I had all these experiences where just being myself and letting my songwriting stand on its own seemed to be what really connected with people,\u201d says Marsh, who received a standing ovation after her solo acoustic performance at McLean\u2019s sold-out show. \u201cI used to think I had to be so much more than that, and have all these different layers happening in my songs. It was kind of a smack in the face, telling me that I never needed to change who I am or what I want to do with my music.\u201d Produced by Eric Novod at Lakehouse Recording Studios in Asbury Park, Revival centers on Marsh\u2019s finespun melodies and powerful voice, an instrument she handles with uncommon grace. In creating the album, Marsh and Novod assembled a lineup of local musicians, recording live to infuse every track with an undeniable energy. And despite unfolding with the occasional sonic flourish, Revival maintains a certain lucid simplicity from song to song. \u201cOn the last record, it was like we were taking each demo and constructing an entire city around it,\u201d notes Marsh. \u201cWith this one, I was really protective about keeping the essence of the original version of the song, and letting the focus stay on the melody and the story I\u2019m telling.\u201d On lead single \u201cTake Me With You,\u201d Marsh brings that dynamic to a delicately arranged reflection on her days on the Jersey Shore. \u201cThat song goes back to all those nights of hopping in a car with a bunch of my friends, playing open mics and then stopping at a diner on the way home,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cIt\u2019s about that youthful feeling of experiencing freedom for the first time and how exciting that is\u2014even if you\u2019re just doing something completely innocent like drinking a smoothie in a diner.\u201d With its intricate guitar work, lush piano tones, and lovingly detailed lyrics, the quietly epic \u201cTake Me With You\u201d bears a bittersweet mood that endures for all of Revival. \u201cWriting these songs brought up a lot of memories of being a teenager, and how challenging it is to try to figure out who you really are,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cThere\u2019s also a lot of looking back at the people and places that shaped me, even if they\u2019re not a part of my life anymore.\u201d But while Revival offers up everything from the stark melancholy of \u201cKids\u201d and elegant intensity of \u201cOn the Count of Three\u201d to the soaring serenade of \u201cI Need You Now\u201d and poignant balladry of \u201cStay with Me Now,\u201d Marsh imbues each song with a brightness of spirit that makes even the most wistful moments feel gently uplifting. Mostly raised in Hopewell Township, Marsh discovered her preternatural sense of melody as a little kid. \u201cI\u2019d just hear songs in my head all the time and start humming them,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mom would ask, \u2018What song is that?\u2019 and I\u2019d tell her, \u2018It\u2019s my song.\u2019\u201d After taking up piano at age 11 (\u201cI started learning and just couldn\u2019t get enough of it,\u201d she recalls), Marsh began putting those songs to music and finding her voice as a writer. Though she mainly grew up on classic rock\u2014thanks to her mom and dad, former musicians who toured around playing parties and off-the-cuff gigs after high school\u2014the release of Adele\u2019s 19 proved instrumental in her development as an artist. \u201cMy music always had such a huge jazz influence to it, and I was never drawn to writing your typical pop song,\u201d says Marsh, who was the first vocalist ever to take part in her high school\u2019s jazz band. \u201cWhen 19 came out, I finally felt like maybe there was a place for the kind of records I wanted to make.\u201d After cutting her teeth at those Jersey Shore coffee shops, Marsh headed off to William Paterson University to further sharpen her craft. During her time in college, she also took up ukulele, partly as a way to make her act more portable. \u201cOne night I was going to play an open mic, and I ended up pushing my keyboard there in this shopping cart that was randomly outside my dorm,\u201d she remembers. \u201cIt got to the point where I was like, \u2018Maybe I should pick up another instrument just to make this a little easier.\u2019\u201d As Marsh steadily built up a following, she began scoring more and more gigs around New York City, including shows at iconic venues like The Bitter End and Rockwood Music Hall. In addition to her City Winery gig with Don McLean\u2014an opportunity that came her way after her performance at The Outlaw Roadshow, a musical showcase co-curated by Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz\u2014she\u2019s also shared stages with artists like Andy Grammer, Gavin DeGraw, and Howie Day in recent years. Now known for the lively contrast between her lighthearted stage banter and emotionally charged performance, Marsh aims to make each set as intimate as possible. \u201cWhether there\u2019s five people or 5,000 people in the crowd, you\u2019ve got to play your heart out,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to give people moments that move them in some way.\u201d With the release of Revival, Marsh hopes to deepen that connection, and possibly inspire listeners to reflect on their own formative years. \u201cThere\u2019s a definite feel of nostalgia on this record, but to me it\u2019s a positive nostalgia,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good to look back and see that even the tough situations or negative experiences helped you to grow, and that it\u2019s all a part of becoming who you are today.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Lauren Marsh will be performing live acoustic at the New Jersey Lottery Festival of Ballooning in Readington, NJ from 4:00PM - 5:00PM on the Cash Pop Summer Stage on Saturday July 24th."}, {"Address": "New York City, NY", "Artist": "Kora (CA) ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8725375.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7127753, -74.0059728], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "Zero - Boat Party - New York", "moreBioInfo": "Kora is an artist project blending diverse sounds and stimulating textures, a place where organic elements and modern means collide.

So it's no surprise the family theme courses through many of its 12 songs. His music career has been a family project ever since he became a full-time touring artist a decade ago. That was right around the time when Jesse met his wife Jess working on a cruise ship in the South Pacific. \"As soon as we got back to the states, I proposed to her at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in July 2010 and we packed up the car for the first tour right after that. We've been touring together full-time ever since.\" Now with two-year-old Lily added to the clan, family is more important than ever to him, including the parental urge to love and protect. \"If I were the moon, I\u2019d light all of your back roads,\" he sings in \"If I Were The Moon\": \"You wouldn\u2019t need no headlights / I\u2019d always be full.\" The life of a touring family inspired the album's title track. \"When we wander, when we wander / Don\u2019t it feel like we\u2019re finally found.\" But in the face of the pandemic, he has found that \"wandering is not just a literal thing. We've followed our hearts with so many decisions in 2020-2021, and have found that there are many ways to wander and be free and brave.\" One of those ways has been going virtual. He says that his livestream concerts have \"become the highlight of my week and the thing that sustains us emotionally and financially. And an amazing community has sprung up from these concerts.\" The stage had been Jesse's home for a decade. He plays around 150 shows a year, from Bonnaroo to the Philadelphia Folk Festival, the 30A Songwriters Festival to AmericanaFest. When the pandemic canceled concerts and delayed the album's release, he pivoted to performing online and found a strong new connection to his fans, who had helped fund his albums all along. \"My musical tribe has always been there for me,\" he says with gratitude. Though recorded in 2019, the songs off the new album click with fans online too. He and his band recorded When We Wander live in the studio, a first for his career. \"I wanted to try that Jason Isbell, Chris Stapleton, Neil Young approach to live recording, prioritizing emotion and raw performances over perfection. I loved that experience.\" Recorded live, the album resonates especially with the intimacy and community spirit of the online shows. He also wrote all the music and lyrics this time, instead of working with collaborators, and took a very personal approach, including a look back. \"In Spite of You\" recalls his stay in a residential facility for behavior modification that traumatized him as a young teenager: \"The sermons that you sold me all were fakes.\" Yet he emerged to earn a degree from Berklee College of Music, net a five-year staff writer gig on Nashville's Music Row penning material for major TV networks, and win prestigious songwriting awards. And then to become the singer-songwriter his countless fan know today, who (in the words of Music News Nashville) \"bring[s] to mind iconic artist/poets like Paul Simon and Jackson Browne...

Right. Now.,\u2019 Satsang\u2019s extraordinary new album and debut release for venerated indie label SideOneDummy, it\u2019s also his muse. Written and recorded during an extended hiatus from the road, the record finds McManus reconnecting with his Montana roots and exploring a whole new palette of sounds and textures, drawing on classic country and modern Americana to forge a joyful, rustic collection all about letting go and living in the moment. McManus produced the album himself, and while the songs here are certainly honest and deeply personal, they\u2019re written in a spiritual language that taps into something far more universal, something inherent in the human condition that binds us as brothers and sisters on a shared journey to find ourselves and our place in this world. The performances and arrangements are broad and spacious to match, reflecting the wide-open fields and soaring mountains that surrounded the band during the whirlwind recording process, and the result is a lush, organic collection fueled by acoustic guitars, fiddle, and pedal steel, a warm, inviting record that hints at everything from Uncle Tupelo and The Jayhawks to Gregory Alan Isakov and The Head and the Heart as it meditates on the power\u2014and the pull\u2014of home. Though McManus was born in Montana, he actually spent much of his formative years in Des Moines and Chicago. His childhood was troubled, to say the least, marked by physical abuse at home and a nose for trouble on the rough streets that surrounded him, and by his late teens, he was struggling with alcohol and drug addiction. After returning to Montana for rehab, he got clean and sober, married the woman of his dreams, and launched Satsang with \u2018The Story Of You,\u2019 the band\u2019s breakout 2016 debut. Steeped in reggae, hip-hop, and world music, the album was an uplifting affirmation that connected with fans around the globe, racking up roughly 15 millions streams on Spotify alone. McManus and his bandmates returned a year later with their similarly successful sophomore effort, \u2018Pyramid(s),\u2019 which hit #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart and #2 on iTunes, and pushed their sound even further with 2019\u2019s \u2018Kulture,\u2019 which incorporated a wider swath of influences from Motown to Tom Petty.

Jane Lee Hooker exploded out of New York City in 2015, and won acclaim in the US and abroad with their debut album of revved-up blues covers \u201cNo B!\u201d The band were immediately snapped up and signed to legendary German blues label Ruf Records. The follow-up album \u201cSpiritus\u201d featured original material and was released in 2017 \u2013 once again to rave reviews from around the world. Jane Lee Hooker toured extensively behind these records, and played to packed houses across the US and Europe, including Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and the Czech Republic. Jane Lee Hooker released their long awaited new single \"Jane Lee Hooker\" earlier this year featuring the band\u2019s signature blend of hard-edged bluesy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Jericho has been featured in the band\u2019s live shows since they toured Europe in 2019, and it quickly became a fan favorite. Singer Dana \u201cDanger\u201d Athens brought the song to the band, with lyrics that are especially relevant with the struggles and challenges that people have recently been facing. Says Athens, \u201cJericho' is one of those songs that kind of wrote itself, the music and lyrics just poured out of me. A lot of songs have been written about the Battle of Jericho, it\u2019s a timeless anecdote for having the strength inside to use our voices to break down the walls that divide us and change our world for the good.\u201d Matt Chiaravalle (Joe Bonamassa, Warren Zevon, Courtney Love, Spacehog, Kittie) produced and mixed Jericho, after previously working with the band on both \u201cNo B!\u201d and \u201cSpiritus.\u201d A new Jane Lee Hooker EP will follow in mid-2021 - and \"Jericho\" gives fans an early taste of what\u2019s to come. Guitarists Tracy Hightop and Tina Gorin discovered their love of blazing dual guitar leads when they played together in the New York City band Helldorado in the late 90\u2019s. Hightop moved on to a stint with Nashville Pussy, and Gorin joined hard rockers Bad Wizard before the two friends met up again in 2010. The idea for Jane Lee Hooker began to take shape when the pair brought in bass player Mary Z, who had spent time with Hightop in NYC punk band the Wives. Singer Athens joined the group in 2013, and soon after the band hit the road. When original drummer Melissa Houston bowed out of Jane Lee Hooker in early 2020, the call was to put out to \u2018Lightnin\u2019 Ron Salvo. Salvo was a natural fit, having played with Hightop and Gorin in numerous NYC projects over the years including Helldorado, Bad Wizard and Plasmatics off-shoot New Hope. The five members of Jane Lee Hooker have decades of playing experience, tearing up stages both nationally and internationally, and sharing the bill with acts including Mot\u00f6rhead, MC5, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Deep Purple, Vanilla Fudge, the Allman Betts Band, Samantha Fish, the Hellacopters, the Melvins, Turbonegro, Ben Folds Five and They Might Be Giants. While Jane Lee Hooker\u2019s blend of rock, blues, punk, R&B and soul pays respect to the greats of the past \u2013 this band lives fiercely in the present tense. JLH\u2019s fiery live performances, featuring muscular lead guitars, a heavy rhythm section and soul-scorching vocals, have made them a must-see live act. In a world full of manufactured bands and live shows backed up by hard-drives, Jane Lee Hooker play rock \u2018n\u2019 roll the way it\u2019s meant to be played \u2013 loud and with passion. Jane Lee Hooker can\u2019t wait to get back out on the road to share new music with their fans around the world.

Clifford - Live at Lizzie King's", "moreBioInfo": "New York based singer-songwriter and bluegrass musician J.M. Clifford was coping with the recent death of a parent and a divorce when the global pandemic hit. Quarantined in his Brooklyn apartment, On a Saturday Night, a record about loss, acceptance and salvation, was born. Though Clifford played in various bands in college and after, he put aspirations of a touring career on the shelf. He became a music teacher at an inner city elementary school and shared his passion for creativity and songwriting with his students. After his mom passed away and his marriage ended, Clifford fell into a depression. \u201cI started dozens of songs, just trying to process what I\u2019d been through, but I couldn\u2019t finish anything. So I went on different medications, got into therapy, researched Buddhism and meditated, sometimes for hours a day.\u201c Once the fog began to lift, new ideas came quickly. After going through old demos to reignite his love for songwriting, Clifford came across an unfinished song called \u201cKick the Drum.\u201d The lyrics spoke of the joys of making music with friends and raising a glass as a way of dispensing with hard times, if only for the evening. It was in part a love song for the Brooklyn bluegrass community Clifford found at its spiritual headquarters, Sunnys Bar, located on the outskirts of Red Hook. \u201cI wandered into the back room of this old bar on a Saturday night and was blown away by the incredible scene there. The line between the audience and the performers blurred into one messy, glorious wash of sound.\u201d Clifford spent countless hours digging into the repertoire, pouring over recordings by Norman Blake, Bill Monroe and The Stanley Brothers. Soon he was hosting his own jams. From there, he took his new found love of bluegrass and started teaching the next generation of bluegrassers at The Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. By July of 2020, Clifford had enough material for a record. On A Saturday Night was recorded at The Bunker Studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Masked up and sanitized, the bluegrass community that lifted Clifford back up on his feet was now helping him put down roots in the genre that he credits with helping him through some very dark times. Co-Produced by Clifford, Ron Pope, and Nicole Cosme, the tracks range from traditional bluegrass romps to delicate and sparse ballads with introspective lyrics. The songs address his personal struggles head on, eventually finding some much needed closure and acceptance. It wasn\u2019t the first time music was Clifford\u2019s saving grace. \u201cAs a kid I was diagnosed with ADD, OCD and a handful of other acronyms. I had few friends and did terribly in school.\u201d When he was nine years old, Clifford fell in love with Guns N\u2019 Roses and started playing the drums. Music became an outlet and a way of connecting with other like minded people. Clifford\u2019s tastes changed as songwriting became his passion. He absorbed soul, folk, and jazz and released a debut record with songs about love, lust, God and existential dread. When his mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, Clifford found himself leaning on music once again. \u201cAfter my mom was diagnosed, she worked as a nurse in a hospice facility. That just blew me away. She was in a lot of pain and dealt with it by easing the suffering of other people. She also encouraged me to use my music in more explicitly therapeutic settings.\u201d In 2018 Clifford started volunteering with Musicians On Call, a program that brought live music to hospital patients. \u201cOf all the musical experiences I\u2019ve had, nothing has compared to what I\u2019ve shared with people in their most vulnerable moments. I left every volunteer session feeling this incredible awe at the ability of music to bring healing to people.\u201d For all of the bad the pandemic brought, it allowed Clifford to start processing painful emotions and memories, distilling them into songs infused with the rhythms and unapologetic vulnerability of bluegrass and old folk songs. Everything came full-circle: things had to fall apart before they could be rebuilt.

David Leon, as he is otherwise known, is the wildcard of Desert Hearts, the San Diego-bred crew of DJs and rabble-rousers tearing up the underground with deep, dark, and weird house and techno. A San Diego native, Leon was influenced early on by older brother Mikey Lion and dusty jaunts to Lightning in a Bottle and Black Rock City, but over the past two years, his renown as a DJ and chops on the decks have grown to match his larger-than-life personality. Porky leveled up his game performing in the mystical jungles of Tulum, the dusty expanses of Burning Man, and perhaps most notably, at the bi-annual Desert Hearts weekenders in Southern California. The group\u2019s ascent from a renegade rager to a dance music phenomenon that has been one of the most celebrated stories in dance music over the past couple of years, and Porkchop\u2019s standout sets and take-no-prisoners party attitude have been at the center of the whole whirlwind. In a sea of black-shirted stoics, Porkchop pours himself into the DJ booth bursting with life and color. His hair and clothing melt into bright gradients and he smiles unpretentiously as he deals out techno obscurities and house crowd-pleasers alike. His sets are a reminder of why we\u2019re all on the dancefloor in the first place\u2013\u2013to party. And nobody gets the party started like Porkchop. He\u2019s noted for being one of the most versatile member of the Desert Hearts Crew. His ability for weaving narratives through genres is clear, and he has a knack for dropping tracks that become moments you remember. With hair in technicolor and his USB filled at all times with dancefloor demolishers, bursting with love and positive vibes, Porkchop has developed into one of the most unpredictable, but dependable DJ\u2019s in the whole scene. He\u2019s earned his way onto stages with the likes of Lee Burridge, Justin Martin, and Tale of Us, played festivals like Symbiosis and Envision in Costa Rica, five-time veteran at Burning Man, playing iconic camps like Robot Heart and Distrikt, and all over North America with the hot-ticket City Hearts tour.

Active since early last decade, Allendes has grown over the years, releasing music for some of the most prestigious labels in the techno / house scene such as Desolat, Kaluki, VIVa Music, Cadenza, Snatch, Mood and Crosstown Rebels. The Fiebre Amarilla World Tour 2009 consecrated him on the world DJ platform and ever since, he has been omnipresent in his home country Chile at Creamfields, Awakenings, Mysteryland and Love Parade Festivals as well as on the world circuit at events such as Tomorrowland, MMW, BPM, ANTS and Hyte to name but a few. His sound as a producer shifts between synthetic house and techno grooves - always displaying flashes of organic rhythms and percussion. Allendes has produced several hits of the tech and house scene - the most recognisable being Caligula, Agility Queen and Esa Nena Quiere; and his production has been widely received and supported by some of the most influential DJs of our time, including Carl Cox, Loco Dice, Ricardo Villalobos, Josh Wink and Luciano. Music in the DNA Francisco Allendes was born in Chile and introduced to music from a very early age. At the tender age of nine, his parents bought him a violin, on which he continued to be classically trained for eight years and which took him to play in numerous chamber orchestras and folk groups. At 17, his musical taste took a turn when he first discovered progressive rock and synthesizers. The synthesizer was his initial contact with electronic instruments, and opened his eyes to a whole new world, which in turn, motivated him into researching new sounds. Soon after, he began to produce his own music and naturally he also moved on to discover the art of DJing. In 2001, he laid his hands on his first Technics and he progressed rapidly to join the circle of professional Chilean DJs. His first productions soon launched him onto the scene and led him to perform at some of the biggest festivals in Chile as well as giving him exposure to the international circuit. The formative years In 2005 Allendes moved to Zaragoza (Spain) and started working with DJ and producer I\u00f1igo Oru\u00e9zabal on the Monomachine and Garlic projects. He soon started releasing on European labels Immigrant, Catwash and Paradigm amongst others as well as playing in some local clubs. In 2007 he took his experience and returned to his hometown, and in association with his long time friend Marcelo Rosselot, started the first vinyl and digital record label based in Chile called Andes Music; aiming to promote upcoming South American artists. Shortly after this his career received a boost when he released a track he worked on together with Alexi Delano named \u201cEl Coleccionista de Piedras, on Matthew Dear\u2019s Spectral Sound label \u2013 all of which began to cement his name within the flourishing tech house scene. Early success and international recognition Allendes thereafter discovered his identity as a producer and developed his unique style (tech house and vigorous dance with Afro-Latin influences. He wrote multiple successful tracks: Esp\u00edritu (Kling Klong Records), Llovizna (Cadenza) and El Ladr\u00f3n de Mails (Cadenza Lab), releases that caught the attention of many international and iconic DJs. In 2009 he embarked on the Fiebre Amarilla World Tour, playing in clubs all over the world, including Japan, the Netherlands, USA, Spain, France, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. This tour put him firmly in the spotlight of the international industry and he soon after made the decision to move to Ibiza. Allendes in Ibiza Francisco Allendes arrived in Ibiza in 2010 and immediately signed up a residency at Ushua\u00efa Beach Club, a venue renowned for the underground music revolution that year and the place that launched the current Ushua\u00efa Club as it stands today. That season Allendes released the track Esa Nena Quiere on Steve Lawler\u2019s label \u201cVIVa Music\u201d - a record that immediately became an overnight success and received high acclaim from Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Reboot, Josh Wink and Tania Vulcano. In 2011 he was called up by Sven V\u00e4th and asked to be Cocoon resident of their party in Formentera (Tipic Club) \u2013 a collaboration that continued throughout 2012. In 2013 he went on to cement a monthly residency at ANTS (Ushua\u00efa) and throughout that summer he played back to back with Paola Poletto there, as well as performing at Loco Dice\u2019s Used + Abused parties and at the Privilege Closing Party. In fact Allendes has become of course no stranger on the Ibiza scene, having gone on to play parties regularly every season including at H\u00ef Ibiza, Space, Privilege, Amnesia, Sankeys, Underground, Heart and also having recently becoming the presenter for the weekly ANTS Radio show which airs on Ibiza Sonica Radio every Saturday. And now\u2026.. The past few years has seen Allendes continue his presence in Ibiza \u2013 still holding a residency at Ibiza\u00b4s biggest underground event \u201cANTS\u201d at Ushuaia, as well as continuing to play parties at several of the islands other superclubs. He\u00b4s also continued his extensive worldwide touring with dates in 2017 spanning the globe and involving sets at some of the worlds most recognisable clubs and festivals. More recently he completed another two huge South America tours which included an exclusive live performance with his own band - the \u201cAllendes Orchestra\u201d at Creamfields, Santiago, Chile. To be able to perform live with fellow musicians in his home city was a dream come true for Francisco and allowed him to introduce elements of his classical past to his electronic present. But of course as much as he loves to tour, you will never find Allendes far from his beloved studio where in the last few years he has penned releases for Desolat, Mood, Be As One, Crosstown Rebels, Kaluki, Underground Music and Snatch. Never one to rest on his laurels, Allendes has his own EP already penned and awaiting release on Solardo\u2019s fast growing label Sola Records, with further releases soon scheduled also on Armada Subjekt and Lost Records. In Fran\u00b4s own words \u201cmusic has always been part of my life \u2013 I have never done or wanted to do anything but music, and I can\u00b4t imagine a day when I wasn\u00b4t doing something music related\u201d.

His story is inspiring to anybody wanting to make their mark on dance music, his story is proof that good things happen to good people. Based in the North West of England, the much-liked DJ/producer has grown from humble beginnings as a resident DJ in 2011, honing his craft in the sweaty intimate basements of his hometown of Southport and growing through to supporting the likes of Masters At Work, and Dennis Ferrer at Southport Weekender. The DJ turned producer has since gone on to win numerous accolades with his studio exports, most notably being presented with an award for the biggest selling record of 2013 by Beatport for his sterling remix of Josh Butler\u2019s \u2018Got A Feeling\u2019 on MTA Records, which was #1 for six weeks and would still today be the second highest selling record of all time on the platform. This would continue the exciting story for the young newcomer, one that would lead to performances at Creamfields Festival (Liverpool), Lovebox (London), Pacha Festival (Amsterdam) and a residency at the infamous Sankey\u2019s Soap Box Manchester. In 2015, he would catch the attention of BBC Radio 1\u2019s key dance music gatekeeper Pete Tong who would announce him as a Future Star off the back of releases on Circus Recordings and 2020Vision setting the tone for a hectic touring schedule over the next year. It would be 2017 though where Bontan would up the game.

A stand out release for both artists. True to form, Bontan swiftly followed up with his debut on Hot Creations. The First Time EP was premiered by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 and was supported by the likes of Faze Magazine, Tsugi and DJ Mag. It went on to receive over 300 radio plays worldwide and again streamed over 500,000 times as both tracks from the EP reached #3 (The First Time) and #8 (Personal Questions) in the Beatport Main Chart.

Part mythical desert harlequin, part modern soul conductor, Mikey Lion is more than a DJ\u2013\u2013He\u2019s a freak of nature and a controller of energy. The San Diego-native has earned a dusty mystique over the past few years as the center of the Desert Hearts movement and as a house and techno provocateur with a stage presence that suggests he will ride this wave all the way to the top. If there's one thing Mikey does well, it's get the party started. Lion has brought the mothafuckin' ruckus to the stages of Lightning in a Bottle, the dustiest storms at Burning Man, and The Do LaB at Coachella, earning nods from Claude VonStroke, Jamie Jones, and Green Velvet in the process. In doing so, Lion and his signature top hat have developed a boisterous voice in the House & Techno scene with strong tribal, hip-hop, and psychedelic elements. But it all started with Wu-Tang and Daft Punk. Lion first found his way behind the decks as a thirteen year old kid, scratching underground hip-hop records religiously after school. At Coachella as a seventeen year old, he witnessed that legendary Daft Punk performance on the same night he tasted his first dose of psychedelics. The show had such a monumental impact on him, he gave up Hip-Hop and became a House DJ the very next day. After honing his craft with weekly marathon DJ sessions at Sala Razzmatazz in Barcelona, Mikey was introduced to Burner culture at Lightning in a Bottle, 2011. It was at his first Burning Man in 2011 that he found a community calling and merged forces with his brother Porkchop, life long friends Marbs & Deep Jesus, and the inimitable Lee Reynolds to form The Desert Hearts Crew. In November 2012, Desert Hearts began as a seedy, 200-person renegade gathering deep in the Mojave Desert. The intrepid crew barely survived a set of extreme weather conditions and unfortunate circumstances, but that first party sparked a fire. The entire point of that first Desert Hearts was to create as much love as humanly possible, and now that same gathering has evolved into the darling of the West Coast house and techno scene. The Bi-annual festival is capped at 3500 attendees in order to create the best possible vibe. Built upon beautiful people getting as weird as possible to deep and trippy house and techno, Desert Hearts has already achieved iconic status in the North American Festival Scene. Desert Hearts has given rise to a family of thousands and it's safe to call it a bonafide movement of love. And while Desert Hearts Records launched in 2014 as a totally-free record label, pushes the sonic aesthetic of the scene, the crew\u2019s busy international calendar of bookings has the DH message spreading far and wide. At the center of it all is Mikey Lion, the dusty prince of desert hearts, a beacon of weird far and wide, and one of this generation\u2019s most compelling agents of love.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "ELROW ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.710677, -73.92635039999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Brooklyn Mirage at Avant Gardner", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "140 Stewart Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Dennis Ferrer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8671704.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.710677, -73.92635039999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Deep House", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "The Brooklyn Mirage at Avant Gardner", "moreBioInfo": "As one-half of Sfere Recordings along with house legend Kerri Chandler, Dennis Ferrer\u2019s name has rapidly built momentum over the past five years amongst house music aficionados. Ferrer's soulful and afro-house influenced productions have appeared on leading house music labels stateside and in Europe. With a discography of original productions that extend from respected labels such as Sfere, Ibadan, Large, and King Street to Basic Recordings, Madhouse and Chillifunk, Ferrer is poised at the very top of the game. He is also widely accepted as one of the leading remixers of this generation of deep house producers and has lent additional production to multiple works on Distant, Defected, Papa, King Street, Large and Slip n Slide labels to name a few. Hits of the past include afro-house biggies \u201cFunu\u201d (Basic Recordings), \u201cKo Ko\u201d (Ibadan), \u201cReach 4 Freedom\u201d (Kingstreet) and \u201cDem People Go\u201d (Kingstreet) to soulful numbers such as \u201cWonderful People\u201d (Metaphor), \u201cJoy to the World\u201d (Sfere) and his classic Soul Collective series on Large Records. Currently buzzing from the Ferrer catalogue: his exquisite production of \u201cIt\u2019s A Beautiful Life\u201d, a remix of S.U.M.O\u2019s \u201cStay\u201d, and the sublime \u201cSandcastles\u201d (co-produced with Ibadan\u2019s Jerome Sydenham), reworkings of D\u2019Jaimin\u2019s \u201cOule Oule\u201d (Slip N\u2019 Slide) and Dubtribe System\u2019s \u201cNothing Is Impossible\u201d (Defected). Ferrer\u2019s interest in production and dance first led him into the world of early 90\u2019s electronic music. After a number of years working with the critically acclaimed Synewave label from New York, he connected with Kerri Chandler who re-introduced him to the soul and funk of music from his youth via House. Ferrer\u2019s love of such artists as T-Connection, DJ Rodgers, early Herbie Hancock, early Cameo and Confunkshun finally found ways to surface in his music. Chandler instantly recognized Ferrer\u2019s talent for production and business sense and together they formed Sfere Recordings in 1998 (Sfere being a name derived from Chandler\u2019s Shelter / Ibadan classic \u201cAtmosphere\u201d combined with Ferrer\u2019s old techno alias \u201cAurasphere\u201d). The label was devised with the ambitions of exploring many different aspects of soulful house including Brazilian, Gospel and Jazz sounds. The emphasis at Sfere is clearly, however, focused on songs since both partners believe in the timelessness of a great song. Ferrer\u2019s DJ career runs in tangent with his increased visibility as a producer and his creative reach covers five continents. December 2003 saw his return to South Africa for a Heineken sponsored series of events alongside UK DJ powerhouse, Pete Tong. He has traveled to multiple European markets and played with regularity in many of the major venues in countries such as the UK (MOS, Soul Heaven, Back To Basics, Ultragroove, Angel Deelite, Neighbourhood), France (Cheers, Sunslice Festival, L\u2019Ambassade, La Noche Festival, Queen), Scandinavia (Hultsfred Festival, Jeriko), Benulux (Pizzaz!), Russia (Propaganda), Greece (Balux), Italy (Red Zone), Japan (Module) and S.

Over the last seven plus years, the friendly character has excelled at many different styles, often ahead of the curve. He does well swung drums as well as bass, main room house and deeper, musically accomplished offerings that stir real emotion. Proof of that lies in his varied and vital discography. Coming on labels like Hypercolour, Tsuba and 20: 20 Vision, it includes many club hits and plenty of handy DJ weapons, but also an ambitious and widescreen debut album on Aus Music, which has become a regular home.

Not afraid of a big hook or slaying bassline, he is an artist who unites a variety of sounds, styles and scenes with ease, and always proves as fun as he is well informed. As a DJ, Huxley is someone as comfortable headlining a vast festival stage as he is holding down a small and sweaty basement. He does so from Africa to Australia and is the sort of selector who always delivers a slick, high impact dose of the good stuff. Such is his definitive sense of taste that he continues to lead from the front on his own Rinse FM show. It is there he welcomes exciting guests such as And.ID, Truncate and Vin Sol, and there that you get a wider window into his musical world.

He was as wild then as he is now, it\u2019s just that on two wheels, Reynolds\u2019 lack of abandon resulted in broken bones, not broken beats. In 1992, he limped off the ramp one last time and soon found himself lost to electronic psychedelia, and thusly one of the West Coast\u2019s finest DJs began his path to the Desert Hearts movement and the hysteria he now conjures with every performance. Now, a quarter century later, Reynolds has a lifetime\u2019s worth of experience bringing the weird and the wonderful to the dancefloor. He earned his chops up and down the West Coast in the dance scene\u2019s dustier institutions\u2013\u2013Moontribe, Moonshake, LiB\u2013\u2013That\u2019s where he developed his endlessly wide palate, penchant for mysticism, and an understanding that a dance party should be a spiritual experience. \u201cWhen I DJ, I want people to feel ecstatic, in a zone, in the moment, like the only thing that matters is the dance,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play music that people can dance to, I want to play music that makes people dance. I want it to sound like aliens are about to land on the dancefloor.\u201d In 2011, It was an encounter with a plucky bunch of San Diegans barely out of their teens that was the calling Lee Reynolds had spent his whole life working towards. Alongside Mikey Lion, Deep Jesus, Marbs, and Porkchop, Reynolds formed Desert Hearts and the rest is history in motion. Over the past three years of bi-annual renegade ragers and relentless touring, \u201cPapa\u201d Lee Reynolds has developed into the patriarch of the fastest growing and most visible cultural movement in all of stateside dance music. \u201cMy real role in Desert Hearts is more on a spiritual level, making sure we spread a positive message and do the right thing,\u201d says Reynolds. Wise words, maybe, but behind the decks, Reynolds is a maniacal presence as he channels his past lives, tastes, adventures, and perspectives into a dancefloor magic that captures you upon first beat and does not release: House, techno, acid, and breaks, they\u2019re all conjured up in a plume of purple haze and that little mad bastard is at the center of it all. Dance music now is so often about fast rises and immediate gratification, but Lee Reynolds\u2019 story is a reminder that some beats taste better when slowly fried over the course of 25 years. \u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with this shit forever and I\u2019ve always believed the madness was coming,\u201d says Reynolds. Well, the madness has commenced, and it seems like it\u2019s here for good\u2013\u2013and Lee Reynolds is conducting the score. - Jemayel Kh\u00e4w\u00e5ja", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "572 Cookman Ave, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Black Clouds ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.2159679, -74.0098603], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "6:45 PM", "Venue": "House Of Independents", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "620 Van Houten Ave, Clifton, NJ 07013", "Artist": "rp ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6344186.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.8579247, -74.14755339999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Dingbatz", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "234 Starr St, Brooklyn, NY 11237", "Artist": "Golf Clap ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11503074.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7055861, -73.9223421], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Techno, House, Disco, Funk, Deep House, Tech House", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Sultan Room", "moreBioInfo": "Detroit has long been a hub for electronic beat lovers and speaker freakers, but Golf Clap\u2019s Hugh Cleal aims to lead a new generation.

A native of Toronto, Canada, Margot studied under a generation of jazz legends including Oscar Peterson, Freddy Cole, Carol Welsman, and Norman Simmons. Equally at home in the musical worlds of jazz, R&B, chamber, and pop, she has been invited to perform in major venues worldwide with a long list of top-tier talent, including rock icon Sting, famed soprano Kathleen Battle, jazz stars Jeremy Pelt and Chris Botti, and pianists Robert Glasper and Geoffrey Keezer. Additionally, her voice can be heard in commercials, feature films, and television programs including Jane Goodall\u2019s Wild Chimpanzees (IMAX 2002), New Year (Doublesee 2010), Lethal Weapon (FOX 2016), The Young and The Restless (2016-2019), and One Good Reason (Alone.Calm 2020). Margot\u2019s new album entitled Power Flower, builds on her unique and emotive interpretations of American Standards. A deeply soothing homage to her influences in the Jazz, Pop, and Funk of the 70s and 80s, Margot spent two and a half years building the work; selecting seasoned titans Geoffrey Keezer, Billy Kilson, Seamus Blake, Ingrid Jensen, and Munyungo Jackson. Included in the liner notes is the phrase \u2018All vocals recorded without use of any pitch correction technology,\u2019 which sums up the attention she has paid to Power Flower. The song selection reveals the same care; three rare covers from Stevie Wonder, Wayne Shorter, and Joe Sample are balanced with three originals and a wonderful arrangement of the traditional song \u201cBlack Is The Color (Of My True Love\u2019s Hair).\u201d Power Flower released in Japan in December 2019 (Coreport), globally in October 2020 (Ropeadope Records) and on vinyl in March 2021. \u201cGillian has a love for song and the storytelling aspect of musical performance.

While their subjects occasionally tilt toward the unexpected, be it Viking adventures, crime stories, tales of incarceration, or what have you, they always manage to stay true to their indie ethos and careen their way through whatever muse happens to attract their collective fancy. Here, for example, they sing in celebration of Sam Houston, a preference for Pennsylvania, or a faithful father, but the sheer exhilaration that comes through in the music is consistently revved up in top gear. Further demonstration of that energy and aptitude is evident in the limited edition live EP Red Bank that reprises four songs from the new album, even while elevating them to new heights. - Lee Zimmerman in no Depression Magazine, Nov. 25, 2017 http://nodepression.com/album-review/all-success-no-failure", "otherInfo": "Mill Pond Music Academy Grand Opening Gala at 42 South Main St"}, {"Address": "601 Main St, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Somewhat Relative ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.2191008, -74.0126125], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Saint", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "AUTUMN CITY: * Saturday, July 24th The Saint Presents the return of Autumn City, an organic indie rock trio from New Jersey, inspired by life, heart break and rising above the ashes.

In one moment we see the push and pull between tradition and progression, and in another we see Pop and Hip-Hop musicians emulating and sampling. In Joe Alterman we find none of this struggle; the music just sounds good. Our conscious faculties are instantly disabled as we tap our feet, feeling the intent and joy of his playing. An old classic is new when you feel good in the moment. This fresh and joyful intent is captured on Joe Alterman\u2019s new release The Upside Of Down. Taken from two live shows at Birdland in November 2019 and February 2020, the album reminds us of a not-too-distant time when we gathered and danced. Joined by Nathaniel Schroeder on bass and Marlon Patton on drums, Alterman cruises gently and delightedly through timeless selections from Les McCann, Oscar Peterson, Henry Mancini and more, with some of his compositions in the mix.

In December 2019, Stelling started another cross-country sprint from California to Florida, where the songwriter who has long called western North Carolina home was raised. Aside from recording his fifth album, Best of Luck, he had toured much of that year, making relentless laps around North America. He wanted to make it home not only for Christmas but also to see Emma, his 92-year-old grandmother. He didn\u2019t; she passed just days before he arrived. Recorded alone in her modest white ranch house in Daytona Beach, Forgiving It All \u2014 Stelling\u2019s wisest, most intimate, and most settled record yet, and his first self-released LP in eight years \u2014 feels like a final tribute to her and to everything he and we have lost or gained. Last year seemed to brim with transformational potential for Stelling. For the better part of a decade, he had been a feverish and itinerant troubadour, spilling guts and blood and sweat in soul-scraping solo sets. He\u2019d lived up the lifestyle, too, hydrating for the stage with booze. But at the end of 2017, he\u2019d gone sober after recognizing that chunks of his life had disappeared. Recorded a year later, Best of Luck \u2014 his third album for Anti- and the first he\u2019d cut with a producer, Ben Harper \u2014 seemed poised to push him to new audiences, its mix of wistful acoustic ballads and stomp-around-the-room rock somehow both polished and primal. The shows were piling up, so much so that Stelling planned to have barely one day off in all of 2020. And then, of course, all that was scrapped. The news closed in around him as he toured north along the West Coast. He turned east and got as far as Colorado, then had a panic attack in a Kansas truck stop, wrestling with existential and professional despair as the world wobbled on its axis. Stelling came home and, like many of us, worked to shape a new routine in a world that was instantly alien. So for the first time in years, he spent days on end with his partner, Julia, and their bounding young dog, Ida. He hiked, read, and watched endless television to placate overwhelming anxiety as best he could. Having fulfilled his label contract (and convinced he didn\u2019t want a new one, anyway), Stelling launched a crowdfunding campaign, asking if fans felt compelled to invest in his songs. They said yes \u2014 he sold more records in those first 48 hours than he\u2019d ever sold in advance before. Stelling began at last to unpack a decade into which he had packed so much. What had music taught him that life had not, and vice versa? What did he have to sing about all that he had seen? The spellbinding 10 tracks of Forgiving It All represent the profound distillates of that reflection. Committed to tape in Emma\u2019s home a year after Stelling cut his intended never-ending tour short, these songs are the lessons of a once-wild kid looking at (not quite) 40, expressing acceptance for the struggles and joys of life and singing out his gratitude for still being here. Opener \u201cDie To Know\u201d is a tender ode to innocence, a remembrance of simple joy and sincerity before experience and age dulled our enthusiasms. \u201cWildfire,\u201d which moves with the ineffable grace of ripples on some idyllic pond, stares down accreted adult fears and begs for the mercy of rebirth. \u201cWWYLLYD\u201d presents an exercise in radical empathy, apt for our universally troubled times. \u201cRemember, everyone is suffering/not just you,\u201d Stelling pleas over strummed chords that rush like blood. The title is an acronym for \u201cWhen What You Love Lets You Down.\u201d We\u2019re all starving artists, it suggests, but that\u2019s what keeps us going, interested, and, if we\u2019re lucky, alive. To some extent, these songs are about letting yourself off the hook, about accepting your imperfections even as you deal with them. But title track \u201cForgiving It All,\u201d as mesmerizing and motivational as a religious mantra, admits that we don\u2019t bear responsibility for all of our baggage, that others have played a part. If we\u2019re going to reckon with ourselves, Stelling says, we have to encourage others to do the same, to share in this catharsis. \u201cLet the doubtful confide in you,\u201d he sings near the start, opening what may feel like the most candid therapy session you\u2019ve ever encountered. Stelling \u2014 truth be told, a marquee fingerpicker who\u2019s never been content to make purely wordless music \u2014 pauses for the gorgeous instrumental \u201cFor Your Drive,\u201d then ends with a hymn of his own, \u201cThey\u2019ll All Proclaim.\u201d It is a gracious, gorgeous aubade for what comes after \u2014 tomorrow, post-pandemic, whenever. We will wrestle for our lifetimes with what happened in 2020 and what may follow. Forgiving It All is an instinctual and honest response to trying to make the best of it: sorting through the past and using the present to prepare for an unwritten future. These songs remind us we\u2019re lucky to be here, no matter what or who it is we have to forgive. \u2013 Grayson Currin", "otherInfo": "Christopher Paul Stelling w/ Special Guest"}, {"Address": "5-25 46th Ave, Queens County, NY 11101", "Artist": "Strange Majik ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11460805.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7474559, -73.95417239999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues, Alternative", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Plaxall Gallery", "moreBioInfo": "Raised on rock 'n' roll born on the blues.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "601 Main St, Asbury Park, NJ 07712", "Artist": "Exmaid ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.2191008, -74.0126125], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "The Saint", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "AUTUMN CITY: * Saturday, July 24th The Saint Presents the return of Autumn City, an organic indie rock trio from New Jersey, inspired by life, heart break and rising above the ashes.

Biography Born to a Finnish American father and a Jewish American mother, employed by the U.S. foreign service, Kaukonen was a founding member of the popular psychedelic San Francisco-based band Jefferson Airplane, which scored two Top 10 radio hits in 1967 with \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit.\" Kaukonen learned to play guitar as a teenager in Washington, D.C. But before moving to the DC area, Jorma and family lived in the Philippines and other locales as he followed his father's career from assignment to assignment before returning to the place of his birth. As a teenager in Washington he and future Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady (who at the time played six-string guitar) formed a band named The Triumphs. Kaukonen departed Washington for studies at Antioch College where friend Ian Buchanan taught him fingerstyle guitar playing. Buchanan also introduced Kaukonen to the music of Reverend Gary Davis, whose songs have remained important parts of Kaukonen's repertoire throughout his career. In 1962 Kaukonen moved to the San Francisco bay area and enrolled in Santa Clara University. During this time he taught guitar lessons in a small music store in San Jose. As a self-described blues purist, Kaukonen never had any ambition to play in a rock band. He played as a solo act in coffee houses and can be heard accompanying a young Janis Joplin on acoustic guitar on an historic 1964 recording (known as \"The Typewriter Tapes\" because of the obtrusive sound of Kaukonen's first wife Margareta typing in the background). Invited to attend a Jefferson Airplane rehearsal by founding member Paul Kantner, Kaukonen found his imagination excited by the arsenal of effects available to electric guitar and later said, \"I was sucked in by technology.\" Jefferson Airplane Kaukonen's electric guitar work was distinctive and widely emulated by other Bay Area guitarists. Notable work with Jefferson Airplane includes \"Greasy Heart\", \"If You Feel\", \"Hey Frederick\" (which culminates in an extended lead guitar duet with himself), \"Wooden Ships\" and his original composition, \"Feel So Good\". Rolling Stone named Kaukonen the 54th greatest rock guitarist of all time and 16th greatest acoustic guitarist. Though never a prolific singer and songwriter during his Airplane tenure, Kaukonen contributed some distinctive material. \"Embryonic Journey\" showcased his fingerstyle acoustic guitar virtuosity. On the next Jefferson Airplane album, After Bathing at Baxter's, his playing developed a harder-edged sound inspired by Mike Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Cream and other groups that visited San Francisco. These stylistic changes are prominent in the acid rocker \"The Last Wall of the Castle\", as well as the instrumental \"Spare Chaynge\", co-written with bassist Jack Casady and drummer Spencer Dryden. Clocking in at 9:12 minutes, this improvisational style was further explored on the free-form extended jams \"Thing\" and \"Bear Melt\", both live instrumentals recorded in 1968. Kaukonen insists, however, on the liner notes of the Live at the Fillmore East album that these jams were not chaotic \"free for alls\" but in fact \"complex rehearsed arrangements.\" Two notable songs that were later to become Hot Tuna signature tunes were also recorded during the 1968-1969 period. These were the traditionals \"Rock Me Baby \" and the gospel ballad \"Good Shepherd.\" Other original compositions with the Airplane appeared on the 1971 album \"Bark\", the instrumental \"Wild Turkey\" and \"Feel So good\", as well as the acoustic autobiographical \"Third Week in the Chelsea\" detailing his feelings about the disintegration of the band. Hot Tuna and solo career In 1969-70, Kaukonen and Jack Casady formed Hot Tuna, a spin-off group that allowed them to play as long as they liked. An early incarnation of Hot Tuna included Airplane vocalist Marty Balin and featured Joey Covington on drums and vocals. This grouping came to an end after an unsuccessful recording jaunt to Jamaica, the sessions of which have never been released. Pared down to Kaukonen and Casady, Hot Tuna lived on as a vehicle for Kaukonen to show off his Piedmont style acoustic blues fingerpicking skills. The self-titled first album was all acoustic and recorded live. With the dissolution of Jefferson Airplane in 1972, Hot Tuna went electric, with Airplane fiddler Papa John Creach joining for the next two albums. Hot Tuna scored an FM hit with \"Ja Da (Keep On Truckin')\" from their third (and first studio) album, Burgers. At this time, Kaukonen's song-writing began to dominate, as further evidenced by the next album, The Phosphorescent Rat, which only featured one cover song. Beginning with their fifth album, America's Choice (1974), the addition of drummer Bob Steeler encouraged a rise in volume and a change of band personality -- a rampaging, Cream-like rock with often quasi-mystical lyrics courtesy of Kaukonen. During this period, the power trio was known for its very long live sets and instrumental jamming. In 1974, Kaukonen recorded the first and most successful of several solo albums, Quah, together with Tom Hobson. Produced by Jack Casady, and featuring (somewhat surprisingly) string overdubs on some tracks, this album contained some of Kaukonen's most deft fingerpicking work, especially on \"Hamar Promenade\", \"Blue Prelude\", \"Genesis\" and \" Flying Clouds\". The curious picture that adorns Quah's cover is today on display at Donkey Coffe and Espresso, a coffee shop in Athens, Ohio. Kaukonen toured vigorously throughout the 1970s in both the United States and Europe, but with Hot Tuna's break up in 1978, the first phase of the band's career ended. Casady left to form the new wave band \"SVT\", while Kaukonen released his second solo album, Jorma, a mix of electric guitar and acoustic fingerstyle in 1979. Meanwhile, he had formed the band \"Vital Parts\". Vital Parts featured bassist Denny DeGorio, who had played in a San Francisco band called the \"Offs\" with ex-Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler. Kaukonen, experimenting with a new image, not only cut his hair but dyed it purple then bright orange, and had extensive tattoos adorn his body, back and arms. The album Barbeque King was released in 1980. Kaukonen's traditional fan base did not warm to this new, perceived to be \"punk\" image, and sales of the album were so disappointing that Jorma was soon dropped from RCA records. He continued playing as a solo artist throughout the 1980s at such venues as The Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia, The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey and in Port Chester, New York. As in his Hot Tuna days, he played very long sets, usually beginning with an hour-long acoustic set followed by a long intermission and then a two hour electric set, sometimes accompanied by bass and drums. Hot Tuna themselves reformed in the late 1980s. At a 1987 Hot Tuna performance, Kaukonen surprised fellow Airplane alumnus Paul Kantner, who was sitting in, with a surprise appearance by his estranged lover Grace Slick; the success of this performance helped to pave the way for a Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and record in 1989. In 1980, Kaukonen appeared on Robert Hunter's Amagamalin Street. This was the third album released by Relix Records, a label, founded by Les Kippel, that specialized in bands from the San Francisco Bay Area. Relix also released Splashdown, featuring a rare performance by Hot Tuna on WQIV, a defunct radio station in New York. Kippel was instrumental in reuniting Kaukonen and Casady in 1985 for a Hot Tuna theater tour. Relix Records was Hot Tuna's record company until 2000, and also released Classic Hot Tuna Acoustic, Classic Hot Tuna Electric, Live at Sweetwater, and Live at Sweetwater 2. Two notable outside projects Kaukonen played on were the David Crosby album \"If I Could Only Remember My Name\" (1971) and Warren Zevon's \"Transverse City\" (1989). In 1993, he collaborated with ex-Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten in recording numerous arrangements of \"Embryonic Journey\". The resulting tracks were released as an album 1994 on the Relix label. In 1999, he played several gigs with Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2000, he appeared with jam band Widespread Panic during their summer tour. With his wife Vanessa, Kaukonen currently owns and operates the Fur Peace Ranch, a 119 acre music and guitar camp in the hills of southeast Ohio, north of Pomeroy; complete with a 32 track studio. He is currently under contract as a solo artist to Red House Records and still records and tours with Jack Casady and other friends such as Barry Mitterhof as Hot Tuna. His 2002 album Blue Country Heart was widely acclaimed by critics as one of the definitive examples of American \"Depression Era \" music and features Kaukonen backed by an all-star Nashville bluegrass band. The album was nominated for a Grammy. His latest album, Stars In My Crown, was released in March 2007.", "otherInfo": "Tables will be positioned 6' apart, with the front row of tables 12' from the performers. \" Tickets will be sold in \"Table For Two,\" \"Table For Four\" and \"Table For Six\" configurations only.

Pre-Pandemic, she performed eight to 10 shows a week in the tri-state area, playing such notable venues as the Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End, the Landmark Theater in Port Washington, Great South Bay Music Festival and the Philadelphia Music Festival. Despite her busy schedule, she still had time to write, record and release her debut album and perform high-profile shows that not only earned her a VIP audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, she was named a Sam Ash Music Store \u201cSpotlight Artist,\u201d and she has been an official Fishman endorsed artist since 2019. In March of 2020, Bella was set to release her new, self-titled, six-song EP, produced by Josh Dion of Paris Monster, which she describes as \u201ccapturing her experiences and spirit,\u201d and one that was already being hailed as her strongest to date. Karen Bella premiered live at the Rockwood Music Hall in NYC on March 13, 2020, the night before the world stopped due to Covid-19. Following the performance, she suffered a broken wrist requiring surgery and several months of therapy, and then she contracted Covid-19. Deciding to put the album release on hold, Bella focused on getting healthy. Finally, now in 2021, after recovering successfully, Karen Bella, is being released to radio and getting the attention it deserves. Her self-titled project is a heartfelt record that transcends genres and encourages deep listening. The lyrics on Karen Bella, at times, feel light and free, then dive without apology into traumatic relationships,betrayal,andpaststruggleswithsubstance abuse.Thoughevery song has a different twist stylistically, the production team and musicians worked hard to craft a consistent, crisp, authentic, timeless, and even dreamy sound. \u201cI grew up listening to a multitude of genres. As a songwriter, there are many benefits to having genre versatility,\u201d said Bella. \u201cI get to share my love for Folk, Rock, R&B, Pop, and Country to its fullest. This record represents that. I want my fans to enjoy these little chapters of my life. My goal as a songwriter is to have a positive effect on the listener, because music has been a miraculous coping mechanism for me, helping me to fight the depression and anxiety that followed traumatic life events.\u201d Bella began studying music and acting in elementary school. She started book- ing for recording sessions at nine years old and was writing songs at age 12. After college, she pursued music full-throttle, releasing her first album, Ordinary Girl in 2013 and performing in legendary venues around NYC. During the Pandemic, Bella has been featured on News 12 Long Island and in the Long Island music publication, Good Times Magazine, speaking about the struggles of being an artist at this time \u2013 including contracting Covid herself \u2013 and inspiring musicians to continue creating, no matter what life throws at you.

That statement could be construed in two distinctly opposite ways \u2013 either the buoyant groove to get audiences out of their seats or the emotional depth to touch a listener\u2019s soul \u2013 but Tyree is the rare case where both meanings are equally applicable. A product of the diverse Washington, DC music scene, Tyree is a performer and composer of virtuosic ability, infectious groove, and eclectic tastes. All of those elements are placed on stunning display on his latest release, Burn It! LIVE, a blistering live set from the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s prestigious BAMcaf\u00e9 Live series. Revealing his multi-faceted talents, that album follows his gorgeous, classically-influenced acoustic solo album Thoughtform Variations, ample evidence of his diversity and range. Determined to play the guitar since the age of four, Tyree studied both jazz and classical music in high school while writing his own rock songs and going to jam sessions at blues clubs at night. He continued his studies at DC\u2019s prestigious Duke Ellington School of the Arts and at Howard University before moving to his current home, Brooklyn, in 2002. The template for his genre-hopping agility was set by the pioneering Miscellaneous Flux, the band that Tyree co-founded in 1998 while still in DC. Refreshingly impossible to categorize, the group fused jazz, hip-hop and punk rock into a crowd-invigorating mix, releasing two EPs and a full-length album before disbanding in 2005 following its members\u2019 move to New York. Its acclaimed 2002 full-length CD, Dead in Dreams, won a \u201cWammie\u201d (Washington Area Music Association award) and garnered four other nominations for the band, including Best Urban Contemporary Instrumentalist for Tyree. Tyree\u2019s longstanding trio BT3 continues in that vein, grafting together jazz, funk and rock in often surprising but always vigorous fashion. The trio recorded their debut CD, re:Vision, in 2010 with special guests John Medeski and DJ Logic, no strangers to boundary-blurring groove. The album also featured tenor saxophonists Stacy Dillard and V. Jeffrey Smith, both of whom reprise their roles on Burn It! LIVE. His solo debut, Thoughtform Variations, displays Tyree\u2019s more introspective side even while retaining his recognizable stamp. The album consists of eight original pieces combining classical, jazz, pop and folk influences into a rich, harmonious sound. Evidencing influences as varied as John McLaughlin, Michael Hedges, and J.S. Bach, the pieces also reflect the indelible contributions made by family, friends and events in his life. Tyree\u2019s staggering versatility and creativity is spotlighted by the wide-ranging list of collaborators with whom he\u2019s worked, including artists as varied as Vernon Reid, Kyp Malone (TV On The Radio), Nicholas Payton, Dr. Cornel West, Res, Nomi, The Family Stand, Clark Terry, Soul Understated (featuring Mavis \u201cSwan\u201d Poole) and Elliott Sharp\u2019s SyndaKit, among others, sharing high-profile stages such as the Apollo, New York City\u2019s Blue Note, Lincoln Center, Tonic, DC\u2019s Blues Alley, Festival Sons d\u2019Hiver (Paris, France), the Clifford Brown Jazz Festival, Chenango Blues Festival, Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival and the Kennedy Center In recent years he\u2019s toured and recorded with the profoundly eclectic Burnt Sugar: The Arkestra Chamber as well as the uncategorizable Memphis singer-songwriter Valerie June, whose idiosyncratic blend of folk, blues, gospel, and soul have brought Tyree to the stages of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the Late Show with David Letterman. His compositions have also taken the leap from stage to screen. He has scored several independent films as well as pieces for television that have appeared on ESPN and in advertising campaigns for companies like Green Team USA.", "otherInfo": "A Summery Caramelized Comeback: Return of the Burnt Sugar Mystery Tour \n\nAvant Groidd bandleader and Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber founder Greg Tate says the Butch Morris-inspired \u201cConduction\u201d he uses to drive the funk-fusion ensemble is a method \u201cakin to Mickey Mouse in Fantasia.\u201d That vision of playful improvisation, raucous power, and pure magic neatly captures the spirit of this accomplished musical collective of Lincoln Center favorites. \n\nFor their first performance since early 2020, this 15-piece electroacoustic incarnation of BSAC reclaims Damrosch Park to electrify with an evening of exhilaratingly danceable fun and Afrofuturistic frolic, blasting a set of high-octane originals and archly outrageous variations of Gershwin classics."}, {"Address": "636 Dean St, Brooklyn, NY 11238", "Artist": "Jared Schonig ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8503721.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6802373, -73.9693035], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Andy Ezrin Trio @ Soapbox Ballery", "moreBioInfo": "Born 1983 in Los Angeles, CA to a family of professional musicians, Jared Schonig began playing the piano at age 5 and the drums at age 14.

Now he is launching a solo project that reimagines Sikh kirtan with boundary-defying Punjabi anthems to uplift & ignite. Sonny's first musical outlet as a child of immigrant parents in North Carolina was singing Sikh devotional music in gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship). His energy shifted to other types of music as he became a more serious musician: ska, reggae, funk, punk rock, bhangra, and more. In 2003, Sonny co-founded the political rock band Outernational and recorded an album produced by Tom Morello. As a singer and trumpet player, he has been central to the sound and raw energy of Red Baraat since the band's inception in 2008, touring globally and recording 5 studio albums. Sonny is currently finishing his debut solo album, produced by Wil-Dog Abers of Ozomatli, entitled Chardi Kala, the Sikh concept of revolutionary eternal optimism. His first single, Mitar Pyare Nu, premiered on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered and Rolling Stone India. Sonny\u2019s music is a reminder that hope, love, and devotion are crucial to our struggles and our collective survival. Chardi Kala is a return to Sonny\u2019s Punjabi & Sikh roots, but with the lens he\u2019s developed over the course of his life as a touring musician, educator, and activist. Musically, the project embodies the many spiritual, political, and aesthetic elements that have shaped Sonny: a bolero-mariachi Sikh shabad on one track, a qawwali song with a reggae bass line on another, a bombastic Ghadar Party tribute in Punjabi and Spanish on yet another. His live band, which includes harmonium, electric guitar, tabla, and drumset, provides listeners with an experience of both introspective reflection and fervent urgency.", "otherInfo": "Sonny Singh's Chardi Kala project plays its first indoor club show in over a year! \n\nYuka Tadano - bass\nRia Modak - guitar, harmonium, vocals\nJonathan Goldberger - guitar\nRohin Khemani - drums and percussion"}, {"Address": "201 Union Ln, Brielle, NJ 08730", "Artist": "Jessica Rose Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11208536.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.1072543, -74.0522045], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country Pop, Country, Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Pig and Parrot Sandbar", "moreBioInfo": "Jessica Rose was named Emerging Artist by the Country Music Association.

It was formed in 1980 by Jairo Varela, who became producer, director, songwriter, vocalist and guiro player. It also included Nicolas Cristanelo, on the piano; Alexis Lozano, on the trombone; Francisco Garcia, on the bass; Luis Pacheco, on the congas; as well as vocalists Jorge Bassam and Hector Viveros. Grupo Niche's first album: \"Al Pasito\" was released that same year, 1980, and placed their native Colombia in a modest position in the salsa world. \"Querer Es Poder\" was Grupo Niche's second album, released in 1981, one year immediately after the first. The group's success was growing larger. \"Trateno\" became the group's third album, which featured \"Atrato Viajero\", one of Varela's compositions of his teen years. And, in 1984, Grupo Niche released \"No Hay Quinto Malo\", which featured their signature song, \"Cali Pachanguero\". But, perhaps Grupo Niche's best recording was their next release, \"Se Paso!\", produced in 1985 under the New York Latin Records label. In 1986, the band incorporated Puerto Rican vocalist Tito Gomez, who had previously worked with the famous Puerto Rican salsa group, la Sonora Poncena, and Ray Barretto, the Godfather of Latin Jazz. Later that year, 1986, Grupo Niche released \"Me Huele A Matrimonio\". Afterward, yet another Puerto Rican joined, the pianist Israel Tanenbaum, who would eventually separate from the group and join a Niche spin-off band: Orquesta Guayacan. Grupo Niche is known for both its vigorous, uptempo dance music as well as slower-paced romantic numbers. Among its best known hits are \"Cali Pachanguero\", \"Del Puente Pa'll\u00e1\", \"Sin Sentimientos\", \"Una Aventura\", \"Etnia\", \"Gotas de Lluvia\", \"Han Cogido la Cosa\", \"Mi Pueblo\", Hagamos Lo Que Diga Corazon, \"Duele Mas\", \"Nuestro Sue\u00f1o\", and the famous cumbia \"Canoa Rancha\". Some of the most famous singers from Niche throughout its changing history include Tito Gomez, Moncho Santana, Charlie Cardona as well as Willy Garcia and Javier Vasquez, now members of the group 'Son de Cali'. They have been very successful, and some of their songs are considered Classics of Salsa Music. The group still enjoys some of its past successes, and, as of 2006, is on tour, making worldwide presentations, and singing their most memorable songs.", "otherInfo": "Lineup subject to change.

Following the success of \u201cB2U\u201d came the smash single \u201cSupernatural\u201d with Quix and Anjulie, and in 2017 Boombox Cartel released his highly anticipated debut EP \u201cCartel\u201d, featuring innovative tracks \u201cAlamo\u201d and \u201cJefe\u201d, which set the bar high for Boombox\u2019s next level artistry and creativity. In 2019, Boombox Cartel embarked on his biggest headline bus tour yet; The Cell Tour. It featured a full stage production, synchronized visuals and sold out dates all across the US, from New York to Los Angeles, Austin, Minneapolis and more. He has toured the globe securing prime slots at major festivals including Lollapalooza, EDC Las Vegas and Mexico, Sunburn, Creamfields and many more. With his intention to bring his music and people from all backgrounds together in each performance, the artist\u2019s built up accreditation in the dance music realm speaks for itself. Boombox Cartel continues to push musical boundaries in his genre-blending output.

One would not guess that this is a man hailed by greats; Ramsey Lewis describes his piano playing as \u2018a joy to behold\u2019, Les McCann states \u2018As a man and musician he is already a giant\u2019. Journalist Nat Hentoff championed three of Alterman\u2019s albums, as well as his writing (Joe wrote liner notes to three Wynton Marsalis/JALC albums, calling one of Joe\u2019s columns \u201cone of the very best pieces on the essence of jazz, the spirit of jazz, that I\u2019ve ever read, and I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d Joe Alterman began at NYU with a BA and Masters in Jazz Piano, followed by performances with Houston Person, Les McCann, Dick Gregory, and Ramsey Lewis. Downbeat describes his sound as \u2018 rooted in the blues, and with a touch reminiscent of the great pianists of the 1950s\u2014Red Garland, Ahmad Jamal, Bill Evans. It is clear Joe hits all of the necessary points for Jazz critics and fans alike. But there is more to the story, of course. The twenty-first century has thus far seen yet another transition for this thing called Jazz. In one moment we see the push and pull between tradition and progression, and in another we see Pop and Hip-Hop musicians emulating and sampling. In Joe Alterman we find none of this struggle; the music just sounds good. Our conscious faculties are instantly disabled as we tap our feet, feeling the intent and joy of his playing. An old classic is new when you feel good in the moment. This fresh and joyful intent is captured on Joe Alterman\u2019s new release The Upside Of Down. Taken from two live shows at Birdland in November 2019 and February 2020, the album reminds us of a not-too-distant time when we gathered and danced. Joined by Nathaniel Schroeder on bass and Marlon Patton on drums, Alterman cruises gently and delightedly through timeless selections from Les McCann, Oscar Peterson, Henry Mancini and more, with some of his compositions in the mix. The Upside Of Down is set for release on August 13.

A native of Toronto, Canada, Margot studied under a generation of jazz legends including Oscar Peterson, Freddy Cole, Carol Welsman, and Norman Simmons. Equally at home in the musical worlds of jazz, R&B, chamber, and pop, she has been invited to perform in major venues worldwide with a long list of top-tier talent, including rock icon Sting, famed soprano Kathleen Battle, jazz stars Jeremy Pelt and Chris Botti, and pianists Robert Glasper and Geoffrey Keezer. Additionally, her voice can be heard in commercials, feature films, and television programs including Jane Goodall\u2019s Wild Chimpanzees (IMAX 2002), New Year (Doublesee 2010), Lethal Weapon (FOX 2016), The Young and The Restless (2016-2019), and One Good Reason (Alone.Calm 2020). Margot\u2019s new album entitled Power Flower, builds on her unique and emotive interpretations of American Standards. A deeply soothing homage to her influences in the Jazz, Pop, and Funk of the 70s and 80s, Margot spent two and a half years building the work; selecting seasoned titans Geoffrey Keezer, Billy Kilson, Seamus Blake, Ingrid Jensen, and Munyungo Jackson. Included in the liner notes is the phrase \u2018All vocals recorded without use of any pitch correction technology,\u2019 which sums up the attention she has paid to Power Flower. The song selection reveals the same care; three rare covers from Stevie Wonder, Wayne Shorter, and Joe Sample are balanced with three originals and a wonderful arrangement of the traditional song \u201cBlack Is The Color (Of My True Love\u2019s Hair).\u201d Power Flower released in Japan in December 2019 (Coreport), globally in October 2020 (Ropeadope Records) and on vinyl in March 2021. \u201cGillian has a love for song and the storytelling aspect of musical performance.

Six String Drag played a major role in the early success of Steve Earle and Jack Emerson\u2019s E Squared label. Roby and his band toured nationally with Earle and other acts and also gained a strong following on the east coast and the midwest. The band was featured on the soundtrack to the Grammy nominated film You Can Count On Me and garnered much critical acclaim for their E Squared release High Hat. In 1998 the band broke up and Roby continued with a solo career releasing two more critically acclaimed albums Mercury\u2019s Blues and Rather Not Know. Roby\u2019s writing and singing have been praised by Billboard, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Boston Phoenix, The Washington Post, Option, No Depression, Performing Songwriter and many other publications. Kenny has also been featured on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered and Acoustic Cafe and has received extensive national airplay on NPR, Americana and AAA radio stations. Ryan Adams has claimed Roby as as an influential writer on his and his former band Whiskeytown\u2019s music. Adams featured Roby\u2019s song Rather Not Know on NPR\u2019s All Songs Considered in 2004. (in a segment called You Play the Dj: Artist\u2019s Picks) As well, Adams recently mentioned Roby in Rolling Stone as the best songwriter that not many people have heard of. Roby's new album \"The Mercy Filter\" leans much less on Americana than previous efforts but dips and turns more into straight up rock, experimentation, Beatle-esque grooves, and soulful ballads. His new band features Scott McCall (Two Dollar Pistols, New Electric Combo), Mark O'Brien (Two Dollar Pistols, Barn Burning), David Kim (Les Dirt Clods, Houston Brothers) and Ray Duffey (Six String Drag, Countdown Quartet, New Electric Combo) To hear more songs, go to www.myspace.com/themercyfilter.

In 2000, the duo shortened their name simply to The Dwellas. In 1994, the Cella Dwellas signed to prominent hip hop label Loud Records, and released their debut single, \"Land of the Lost\". The following year, the duo made one of their earliest appearances on the Masta Ace Incorporated album Sittin' on Chrome, featured on the track \"4 Da Mind\". Also in 1995, the Dwellas released a pair of singles, \"Good Dwellas\" and \"Perfect Match\", which were the duo's only charting singles. \"Land of the Lost\", a sequel to \"Good Dwellas\" and \"Perfect Match\" were included on the duo's 1996 debut Realms 'N Reality. The album was a moderate underground success, debuting at #160 on the Billboard 200 album chart, #21 on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and #10 on the Heatseekers chart. The majority of the album was produced by Nick Wiz, and also featured beats from DJ Megahurtz, The Bluez Brothers and the duo themselves. The album received considerable acclaim from both critics and underground fans, due to its unique lyrical style and dark, atmospheric production. All Music Guide writer Michael Di Bella describes the album's style as a combination of \"Dungeons and Dragons-style role-playing games, horror flicks, slick, rugged beats, and imaginative, often humorous lyrics\", and called the album \"an exciting and bizarre ride through two warped intellects.\" [1] UG and Phantasm returned in 2000 with their simplified title, The Dwellas, and released their sophomore album, The Last Shall Be First through Loud Records. The album again featured production from Nick Wiz, as well as star beat-makers like Large Professor, Ayatollah and Rockwilder. Guests on the album included Large Professor, Inspectah Deck, Cocoa Brovaz and Organized Konfusion. The album received moderate reviews, but received little attention, failing to reach any Billboard chart. The album's singles, \"Stand Up\", \"Leakage\" and \"Game of Death\", all failed to reach any Billboard singles chart. All Music Guide once again praised the album. Writer Jon Azpiri stated that the duo could \"more than hold their own among hip-hop heavyweights\" and \"after listening to The Last Shall Be First, it's clear that the Dwellas have risen to another level.\" [2] The duo's only release since The Last Shall Be First was a single titled \"Who Killed the Hip Hop\", released in 2003. They have yet to release a third album.", "otherInfo": "Cella Dwellas 25 Year Anniversary Show at Arlene's Grocery! with Almighty Grams and Jay Royale"}, {"Address": "599 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Nights ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.7096703, -73.9232787], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Shoegaze, Alternative", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Loft", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "116 E. 16th St, New York City, NY 10003", "Artist": "Mike Vecchione ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9616627.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7353826, -73.9884719], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stand (Main Room)", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Mike Vecchione, Big Jay Oakerson, Rich Vos, & More!"}, {"Address": "30 Park St, Montclair, NJ 07042", "Artist": "The Cliffs Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9698854.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.8161813, -74.218414], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Just Jakes", "moreBioInfo": "We are an 8 piece supergroup, comprised of seasoned musicians playing the songs you know and love!", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "23 Meadow St, Brooklyn, NY 11206, USA, New York City, NY", "Artist": "Wally Callerio ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7838882.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7109796, -73.93630379999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues, Jazz, Deep House, Nu Jazz, House Music, Trip Hop, Electronic", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "The Brooklyn Monarch", "moreBioInfo": "WALLY CALLERIO ______________________________________________ To be a successful house music producer, you have to make tracks that DJs want to play. And, to be a good DJ, you have to play music that inspires people to move their asses. Simple in theory, but not in execution. Wally Callerio\u2019s inherent ability to do both \u2014 and to do both well \u2014 has served him justly over the last two decades, establishing him as an artist with talent, vision and staying power in a genre that has navigated tumultuous highs, lows and growing pains in between. With over 20 years of experience behind the decks and in the studio under his belt, Callerio has put out a remarkable 250 original tracks and remixes on over 50 labels worldwide. Most recently, his music has been released on such respected heavyweights as Defected, Cajual, Farris Wheel Recordings, Grin Music and Sampled Recordings. In addition, Callerio has earned accolades under his alter ego moniker Poncho Warwick, consistently ranking as a top annual pick for best chillout artist on Beatport. In his role as Music Supervisor for \u201cUnconscious Therapy,\u201d a documentary released in April 2016 that chronicles the rise and evolution of house music via the lens of Frankie Knuckles and his fellow innovators, Callerio took on the crucial responsibility of licensing and curating the film\u2019s soundtrack. He is also a featured artist in the documentary, alongside Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, Masters at Work and a bevy of other house icons. Possessed of an entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to embrace change, Callerio has earned and enjoyed enduring success as both an artist and label-owner. Los Angeles-based Dufflebag Recordings, which Callerio launched in 1998, has been churning out deep and funky grooves suffused with soulful vocals since its inception, and the label boasts an impressive roster of artists that includes Demarkus Lewis, Manjane, Alysha Kid, Corduroy Mavericks, JT Donaldson, Natural Rhythm, Ryan Truman and R&B legend Jon B. under his moniker Jah Ques. For Callerio, house music still holds just as much untapped potential as it did when he first cut his teeth on the genre in the early nineties \u2014 and he\u2019s never been one to rest on his laurels when his passion is at stake and opportunity abounds. \u201cI don\u2019t try to predict the future of house, I try to give it my imagination and push with my music,\u201d Callerio says. \u201cI try to inspire people into making and playing the right stuff.\u201d That drive and openness have kept Callerio prolific, relevant and on top of his game \u2014 and better still, are a promise of many good things yet to come.

Descended from a family of cowboys and Baptist preachers, he\u2019s part African- American, part Egyptian, part Cherokee Indian but while his heritage is all- American his global outlook, and unique way of viewing the world through the prism of contemporary music culture, transcends his Mid-Western origins. Born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and raised in suburban Detroit, Seth learnt the art of DJing initially from his stepfather (then a college Radio DJ) and later working behind the counter in legendary Detroit record store \u2018Melodies & Memories\u2019. It wasn\u2019t until he made the brave decision to seek new-beginnings in mid- 2000s Berlin that his DJ career really found its feet. Moving to Berlin fresh out of his teens, just as the minimal techno movement was kicking off, was the making of Seth and since then he hasn\u2019t looked back. Since moving from Detroit to Berlin, and more recently London then Ibiza, ten years ago, Seth has established himself as one of underground electronic music\u2019s most iconic figures, equally at home playing to the smoke-filled dancefloors of some of the world\u2019s most discerning nightclubs, such as fabric, Nortstern, De School or Output, as he is headlining the world\u2019s largest festivals, like Glastonbury, Lowlands, Roskilde or Tomorrowlands. Right from the word go Seth has been as passionate about food and contemporary art as he is about music and these two interests have resonated at all points in parallel alongside his music career. A multi-faceted polymath: he has held residencies at talismanic music institutions such as DC10 (Ibiza), fabric (London) Trouw (Amsterdam), and Output (NYC), runs three record labels, owns a successful restaurant \u2018Smokey Tails\u2019 and is just about to unveil a new project that sits firmly at the intersection between futuristic electronica, contemporary art and technology. In 2013 he was voted number one DJ in the world in Resident Advisor\u2019s prodigious \u2018Top 100 DJs\u2019 poll. In 2016 he was member of an expedition to the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro lead by renowned Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo that raised over $1million for brain cancer charities. \u201cI live to work on projects and build ideas that sit at the point where art, commerce and ideas meet.

His focus on house music from the land of funk and disco, was triggered while playing the club and warehouse scene in San Francisco. As one of the major players in laying the foundations of a strong West Coast dance scene, Doc has always been a master of mixing the crowd with the music. Neatly avoiding pigeonholing, while embracing a myriad of different styles, his set creates a warm unique vibe of empathy on the dance floor. Doc's legendary 8 hour sets at Flammable Liquid, Sunday Love, to the most underground lofts, and warehouse parties know no colors, age or sexual orientation. Not only does he regularly devastate dance floors in prestigious clubs like New York's Twilo and Liverpool's Cream, to the smallest loft parties, but he can also send a crowd of ravers into a euphoric groove. That's rare these days in a scene where there are sizable walls between the two ends of the dance music spectrum. While most star DJ's are one-note musicians sticking to a single subgenera of music, Doc' s live sets bring many styles of music as well as people together. In this age of specialized formats among DJ's and producers, what sets Martin apart from his peers is his ability to spin everything from deep house, acid, funk, tribal, and classics in a set, while having it all make sense. Doc is one of the most sought after DJs in America. Constantly touring, he can be found playing records everywhere from England to New Zealand, and everywhere in between. As the first West Coast DJ to ever hold many residencies in New York, he continues to spread the gospel according to Doc. Now residing in L.A. he has begun to spread his vibe through making music in the studio as well as playing it. Remixing The Mighty Dub Katz projects for Nervous Records, as well as original tracks for Moonshine, Shaboom, 99 North, and the ever growing Leaf Recordings to name a few. Doc's magic continues to grow, whether it is on the turntables or in the studio. He is a future legend of house and loved by thousands all over the world.

After four decades of singing background for icons like the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, and Nine Inch Nails, Lisa is finally offering her own humble, heartfelt song, accompanied by her inventive new band Grand Baton. The past 18 months have been a whirlwind, with performances at the Newport and Monterey Jazz Festivals, at the Hollywood Bowl, and in major cities all over the world. The unexpected success of the Oscar-winning documentary Twenty Feet from Stardom (2013) altered the course of Lisa's musical journey. The film told her story, complete with clips of her 1991 Grammy-winning R&B hit \"How Can I Ease The Pain,\" live footage of her legendary duets with Mick Jagger on \"Gimme Shelter,\" and glowing testimonials from famous colleagues like Sting, Patti Austin, and Chris Botti. It showcased her virtuosity and vulnerability, opened a window on her sometimes lonely life on the road, earned her a second Grammy award, and left audiences eager to see and hear more. Lisa set out on her first tour with no recordings or video to help book and promote shows, headlining first in small clubs, moving quickly to festivals and concert halls. Journalists, music business insiders, and supporters jumped in to spread the word. \"Her glamorous-girl-next-door quality makes fans all over the world think she's their own secret discovery.\" (Broadway World) \"A sublime experience,\" \"phenomenal times infinity,\" \"mind blowing,\" \"an intangible souvenir that will remain in our hearts and minds forever.\" (Facebook followers) \"Transcendental!\"(The Huffington Post) \"She brought down the house in the single best show I\u2019ve seen in the many years I\u2019ve visited Birdland.\" (The New York Times) \"You know you're in the presence of greatness when the hair on the back of your neck stands up. On her own stage, [Fischer] exuded supreme confidence. The display of vocal magic was mesmerizing . . . quiet and subtle until the mighty shout was unleashed . . . .\" (The Edmonton Sun) \"[A] wondrous instrument that can seamlessly blend classical, jazz, soul, gospel, rock and folk.\" (Minneapolis Star Tribune). Lisa has found ideal co-conspirators in Grand Baton. The band's organic fusion of African, Middle Eastern, and Caribbean rhythms, psychedelic soul, and progressive rock awakens and ignites Lisa's flexibility and freedom of expression. \"Collectively they bring amazing musicianship, hearts and souls and most importantly a sense of playfulness,\" she says. \"It's a dream to be sonically surrounded with this kind of sensitivity and care.\" The band has helped her realize her lifelong desire to make music that heals but still rocks the house. In performance, she draws from an eclectic palette of influences, whether putting her stamp on Led Zeppelin and Little Willie John or recasting rock anthems from her tours with the Stones and Tina Turner. While Lisa's range is legendary, her greatest gift is the ability to connect, to reach the hearts of her listeners. Raised in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, Lisa emerged from New York's fervent studio scene in the early-1980s and quickly became session singer royalty. She paid her dues as a member of the Marvelettes before legendary vocalist Luther Vandross invited her to sing background with his touring band. He became her mentor and friend, nurturing her talent over a 20-year period until his untimely passing in 2005. During Lisa's two decades working with Luther, her voice also powered albums by a constellation of music legends including Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Bobby McFerrin, George Benson, Diana Ross, Laurie Anderson, Teddy Pendergrass, Dionne Warwick, Grover Washington, Billy Ocean, Melba Moore, Al Jarreau, Patti LaBelle, and other major recording artists. Lisa joined the Rolling Stones on tour for the first time for their 1989 Steel Wheels tour; she has graced their stage for 26 years. When the spotlight catches Lisa singing with Mick Jagger she is a quintessential rock and roll goddess, soaring above the band's earthy groove. \"It's always a high point in the show for me,\" says Mick. Keith Richards commends Lisa's \"amazing power, energy, and projection.\" In 1991, in the midst of touring with both the Stones and Luther Vandross, Lisa recorded a solo album, So Intense, for Elektra Records. \"I used members of my session singing community on the CD, so I felt surrounded by love,\" she says. \"The most difficult thing was finding the right music. It was also the most exciting thing.\" The album featured Lisa's songwriting collaborations with producer Narada Michael Walden on both the Top 10 R&B hit \"Save Me\" and the number one and Grammy-winning R&B single \"How Can I Ease the Pain.\" Lisa also won the Grammy for \"Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female,\" an honor she shared with Patti LaBelle, whose award-winning project Burnin' also featured Lisa on background vocals. Though she continued to record for soundtracks and various studio projects, Lisa's career revolved around supporting other artists. Then, in 2011, the late Gil Friesen and director Morgan Neville approached Lisa when they began interviewing singers for Twenty Feet from Stardom, a feature-length documentary celebrating the contributions of background vocalists. Alongside vocal trailblazers like Darlene Love and Merry Clayton, Lisa candidly discussed the delicate balance between life and career, success and challenges, as well as the nuance of singing with other vocalists. \"Ms. Fischer has become the unexpected star of Mr. Neville's film,\" said the New York Times. \"She's the empress of that world,\" music legend Patti Austin declared in the film. \"That's a powerhouse voice. I think of her as a star,\" said Sting. Between her down-to-earth persona in interview footage, her vocal mastery in archival clips, and her multi-tracked performance of Samuel Barber's \"Sure on This Shining Night,\" Lisa moved viewers with her voice, her soft-spoken charm, and her thought-provoking insights. \"This movie is going to make Lisa Fischer a star,\" said music industry pundit Bob Lefsetz. \"And she deserves it, because she's just that damn good.

Two Super-Bowl appearances, Pollstar Box Office chart-topping tours with Def Leppard, Journey, Boston, REO Speedwagon, Bad Company (to name only a few), two more studio albums and no end in sight, STYX continues to conquer the planet, one venue at a time. Spawned from a suburban Chicago basement in the early \u201870s, Styx would eventually transform into the virtual arena rock prototype by the late '70s and early '80s, due to a fondness for big rockers and soaring power ballads. Early on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake & Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as non-stop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until a track originally from their second album, \"Lady\" started to get substantial airplay in late '74 on the Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with their record label, and opted to sign on with A&M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (their former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, original guitarist John Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw. Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as \"Come Sail Away,\" \"Renegade,\" \"Blue Collar Man\" and \"Fooling Yourself.\u201d The band decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once-beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as \"Too Much Time on My Hands\". It also marked the first time in history that a band released four consecutive triple-platinum albums. A career-encompassing live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of its members pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. A re-recording of their early hit, \"Lady\" (titled \"Lady\" '95\"), for a Greatest Hits compilation, finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- as he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's \"Return to Paradise,\" while a whole new generation of rock fans were introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track \"Mr. Roboto,\" as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks & Geeks.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "622 Green Ave, Brielle, NJ 08730", "Artist": "Predator Dub Assassins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8334325.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.1077035, -74.0517914], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Reggae", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "P-Dub acoustic @ Waypoint Waterman's Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "Official Website: http://dubonline.net/", "otherInfo": "https://www.dubonline.net"}, {"Address": "3001 New St Unit A2, Oceanside, NY 11572", "Artist": "Dudley Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8371487.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.6390399, -73.65607849999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz, R&b, Hip Hop, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Barrier Brewing Co.", "moreBioInfo": "Dudley Music is a Long Island-based Hip Hop singer-songwriter, producer, and jazz musician, playing saxophone, keys, guitar, drums, flute, and clarinet.

The concept of Vini Vici was formed by the boys with an intention to express their love for the old school sound, paired with their progressive ideas. Iboga Records and FM Bookings, widely considered to be the biggest psytrance label and booking agency, were the first to see the potential of the project and invited them to be part of their well respected family, alongside names such as: Ace Ventura, Liquid Soul, Ticon, Captain Hook, Atmos, and the like. After the huge success of their premier EP 'Divine Mode' and their follow-up \u2018Back Underground\u2019, \u2018Expender\u2019, \u2018Anything & Everything\u2019, and \u2018Veni Vidi Vici\u2019 tracks (all top sellers on Beatport and Iboga Records charts), Vini Vici continued to produce massive hits while touring the world nonstop - Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, Finland, France, India, Denmark, Germany, United State, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Australia, Serbia, Netherland, Scotland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel\u2026.. It's no surprise Beatport positioned them at No.3 on the Top Artist list of 2014. 2015 was a huge step forward for the boys with the release of their debut album \u2018Vini Vici - Future Classics\u2019. They hit the Beatport Main Chart at No.2 (Psytrance at No.1) - a position that very few psytrance artists have managed to stand at before, followed by Psyshop No.1 and TrackItDown No.1 spots, while the legendary Infected Mushroom named them \u201cthe best upcoming psytrance artists at the moment\u201d. The explosion continued when trance king Armin Van Buuren edited their already classic tune \u2018The Tribe\u2019, and featured them on his legendary \u2018ASOT\u2019 radio show over and over again. Finishing 2015 with a bang, the boys were ranked by Beatport as No.1 on the PsyTrance Artist chart and they also landed the Best Selling Track of 2015. They continued to make history early in 2016 with their Vini Vici Remix of \u2018Hilight Tribe - Free Tibet\u2019 - the track gained over 15,000,000 views on YouTube and 5,000,000 plays on Soundcloud, while also hitting the No.2 spot on Beatport\u2019s Main chart, and becoming the first psytrance track ever to have entered the Beatport Main Top 10. After such an outstanding beginning to 2016, it\u2019s no surprise that the rest of their year continued to bring this elevated level and even after many successful years before became their best year by far. Some even call it the \u2018The Vini Vici Year\u2019 - with over 220 shows in some of the most prestigious electronic music events around the globe (A State Of Trance Festival NL, Tomorrowland BE, Boom Festival PT, Electric Daisy Carnival in U.S.A, Ultra BR, Dreamstate U.S.A, Transmission CZ, Experience BR, Vuuv DE, Sunburn GOA, Luminosity NL, Earthcore AU, Unity IL just to name a few\u2026). Keeping their No.1 spot on Beatport\u2019s Psytrance Artist list and Best Selling Track for the second year in a row went on to lead a new generation of psytrance fans and producers to their style. Just before ending off 2016 came the jewel in the crown; a collaboration with no other than one of the solid founders of modern electronic music - Armin Van Buuren, featuring french band Hilight Tribe in their creation \u2018Great Spirit\u2019. This massive collaboration took over the Beatport Main Chart immediately and gained over 1,000,000 views on YouTube in just 2 weeks, taking them one step closer to their life goal of spreading psytrance culture and energy in the world.

That premier album was strongly influenced by many 4AD acts, brought into sharp focus by the mixing of This Mortal Coil\u2019s John Fryer (Lush, NIN, Depeche Mode) and featuring artwork by 4ADs legendary designer, V23's Vaughan Oliver (Pixies, Bauhaus), which further enhanced their strong aesthetic connections to that label. The band maintains a distinctive ethos--embracing their idols, while still forging their own sound. Their second LP, Beyond Desire, coming October 13th via Papercup Music finds them working with legendary My Bloody Valentine engineer Guy Fixsen (MBV, WIRE) and Jorge Elbreht (Ariel Pink, No Joy, Frankie Rose, Violens, Lansing-Drieden) with artwork from Timothy O\u2019Donnell (another 4AD design alumni) at Mexican Summer's Gary's Electric studio in Greenpoint. The new record finds them exploring something much more than bands within their sphere typically strive for - it's introspection leavened with human connectedness and higher arching themes of maturation and growth that transcend the basic needs of lust and want. This record comes far closer to approximating their live show, with a scorching sound that is often volatile, rife with damaged guitar deconstructions and gleaming figures, yet maintains their eminently melodic sensibilities. Beyond Desire, shifts from shimmering to scorching at the drop of a hat held together by rock solid songwriting. By moving between both ends of the spectrum, the ten tracks on Beyond Desire function both as blissed-out, resplendent expository narratives, and also as pure, white-noise nihilism. Both their live performances and album, replete with gorgeous packaging and artwork, are crucial entry points to understanding the band. Their upcoming tour will take them across the country from New Orleans to California playing in old and new cities alike over the course of three months. DLE has done multiple national tours over the past three years resulting in over 200 shows and taking them to SXSW, CMJ, NXNE, Northside Festival and everywhere in between. Previous tours and SXSW bills included Swervedriver, A Place to Bury Strangers, The Ocean Blue, The Warlocks, Modern English, The Wedding Present & Trail Of the Dead. They're also veterans of the Desert Stars festival, sharing a bill with the Lemonheads and opening for Lou Barlow in the Joshua Tree desert in 2016. They've toured the East with Slumberland bands Weekend and Lorelei, and on the West Coast with Beach Fossils and the Telescopes at The Echo. They played a festival in 2011 with the Psychedelic Furs as well as sold out shows in 2010 opening for the then recently reunited Chapterhouse and Ulrich Schnauss. They\u2019ve constantly topped the CMJ Top 20 indie charts, have played twice live on the venerable KEXP's John in the Morning, and were recently featured as song of the day, while simultaniously on regular rotation on KEXP, and have also been featured on Nic Harcourt's KCSN show Morning Becomes Electric. \"DLE bring you Dream-Pop!\" -FILTER Magazine \"Some of the best live music in the city\" -Time Out NY \"Brooklyn\u2019s Dead Leaf Echo play guitar-pop in the mold of Primal Scream and Swervedriver.\" - Death and Taxes \"We love Dead Leaf Echo's dreamy pop\" -The L Magazine", "otherInfo": "Free Outdoor Show"}, {"Address": "371 High Mountain Rd, North Haledon, NJ 07508", "Artist": "Marilyn Castillo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11563913.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.9519563, -74.18250549999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Latino Alternativo, Mexican Folk, Latin Pop, Pop", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Bohemian Night with Marilyn Castillo", "moreBioInfo": "Described as \u201ca soulful Latin diva with an experimental edge\u201d by Ilana Martin, director of the Vocal Workout Singing School, Marilyn Castillo is among the many rising stars in New York\u2019s Latin music scene, drawing audiences with her touching singing style and interpretation.

For New Jersey singer/songwriter Tara Dente, that duo of traits is on full display on the new album called Truth In The Mud. Grounded in a kind of rootsy Americana, it\u2019s only after letting each song bloom that one begins to hear all of Dente\u2019s varied influences. From her early years surrounded by the sound of Celtic and church hymns, to her self-guided tour through American vernacular music, you hear solid fingerpicking, storytelling, and a voice that always offers comfort. And from influences as diverse as Nick Drake and Enya, you hear a focus on not just songcraft, but soundcraft - using words and music seamlessly to create a cohesive whole. Since stepping into Asbury Park\u2019s music scene back in 2012, Dente\u2019s reputation has been steadily building, buoyed by her standout 2014 debut called Leave Your Ghosts Behind as well as 2017\u2019s The Gleaner, released worldwide on Travianna Records. With Truth In The Mud, Dente has made her most compelling artistic statement yet. This is the work of an artist in complete command, but still vulnerable to the kind of self-doubt that makes her feel approachable and welcoming. There\u2019s comfort in her songs, because Tara Dente knows what to say - and how to say it - at exactly the right time. Never is that more accurate than on \u2018Hill So Steep,\u2019 the new album\u2019s leadoff track. Despite being written well before 2020\u2019s unprecedented disruption to artistic life, Dente tackles the classic Sisyphean predicament that has become all too familiar for artists living and working in our current environment. As she explains, \u201c\u2019Hill So Steep\u2019 is about a dream I had. In the dream, I was driving up a hill so steep, I felt like I was climbing the steepest roller coaster with no belt on or bar to hold me in and would just fall out. The dream certainly reflected difficult circumstances happening in my life at the time. I was a server at a popular restaurant in my town and did pretty well in tips that day. As soon as I turned the corner walking to my car after work, I noticed it, as well as a slew of other cars, had been towed. The dollar amount it took to get my car back from the auto shop was the exact amount I had made that day in tips. That night, I had the dream. Sometimes you take a step forward, and then take a step right back. But then another day, you'll take three steps forward. You just have to hang in there the best you can and look for the next right thing.\" Truth In The Mud is a giant step forward. And there are many more to come. This is no longer an artist on her way.

Already devoted to turntables, he heard something different in those tracks, and he \u201cwent for the difference. I never got a break in New York, but England happened right away, so I catered to them.\u201d In any event, the Todd Terry sound was born. By 1988, Todd Terry hit big in England and Europe, and his notoriety was making its way back to the U.S. In addition to DJ appearances, Todd was cutting his classic underground tracks A Day In The Life, Weekend, and Can You Party, released under monikers such as the Todd Terry Project, House Of Gypsies, and Royal House, all considered essential and ground breaking. In the mid 90\u2019s, the Ministry of Sound\u2019s eponymous UK label released A Day In The Life, a collection of Todd Terry tracks that had been causing dance floor panic. That then led the way to a deal with Mercury Records allowing him to set up a context in which to work with his favourite singers and performers. The first release, Keep On Jumpin\u2019 on featured a vocal workout from super-divas Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown, together for the first time ever. The song became a top 10 UK crossover pop hit and worldwide smash. Todd followed with the anthem \u2018Somethin Going On\u2019, a top 5 UK crossover pop hit. All the while, Todd continued to break new ground as a Producer/Remixer. From SNAP to Annie Lennox to George Michael to Bjork, Todd\u2019s mixes bridge the ground between club cool and commercial accessibility. In 1995, his remix for Everything But The Girl\u2019s Missing became a worldwide smash, giving the British duo their first ever hit. He then rode the charts with mixes for Garbage (Stupid Girl), The Cardigans (Love Fool), Everything But The Girl (Wrong), 10,000 Maniacs (More Than This), Jamiroquai (Alright), The Cardigans (Been It), and The Lightning Seeds (You Showed Me),.among others. He also produced a Robin S track (Givin\u2019 You All That I\u2019ve Got) for the multi-platinum Space Jam soundtrack. Todd is one of the world\u2019s most celebrated figures in dance music.

He\u2019s a natural storyteller, balancing the exuberant with the poignant, and able to distill universal truth out of his often romantic, drawn-from-life tales. Cohn followed up his platinum-selling debut with two more releases in the 1990s, at which point TIME magazine called him \"one of the honest, emotional voices we need in this decade\" and Bonnie Raitt declared, \"Marc is one of the most soulful, talented artists I know. I love his songs, he's an incredible singer, and I marvel at his ability to mesmerize every audience he plays for.\" Raitt, James Taylor, David Crosby, Graham Nash and Patty Griffin all made guest appearances on Cohn\u2019s early records for Atlanta, as his reputation as an artist and performer continued to grow. In 1998, Cohn took a decade-long sabbatical from recording, ending in 2007 with Join the Parade. Inspired by the horrific events following Hurricane Katrina and his own near fatal shooting just weeks before, Parade is his most moving and critically acclaimed record to date. About his album Listening Booth: 1970, a collection of reimagined classics from that seminal year in music, Rolling Stone said, \u201cCohn has one of rock\u2019s most soulful croons \u2013 a rich immediately recognizable tenor that makes these songs his own.\u201d In late 2014, Cohn released, \u201cThe Coldest Corner in the World,\u201d the title song to the documentary Tree Man and his first original song released in more than seven years.

In addition to releasing new music, Cohn has put together a 25th anniversary concert tour where he is performing his debut record in its entirety from start to finish.

Now, whether live or on record, the band still radiates the energy of a ragtag crew of music students playing bluegrass on the street. But anchoring that energy is their instrumental chops, their strong songwriting, and their varied influences that stretch beyond bluegrass, even beyond American roots music altogether. Whether sharing lead vocals and instrumental solos or blending their voices into loose, joyous harmony, the four members of Damn Tall Buildings (guitarist/lead vocalist Max Capistran, bassist/lead vocalist Sasha Dubyk, fiddler/vocalist Avery Ballotta and banjoist/vocalist Jordan Alleman) blend elements of bluegrass, blues, roots-rock and vintage swing to create a captivating, high-energy sound. Since their busking days, they\u2019ve made three albums: 2014\u2019s Cure-All, 2015\u2019s self-titled, and their forthcoming third album, Don\u2019t Look Down. The band has also relocated to Brooklyn, NY and toured widely, sharing stages with Sierra Hull and the California Honeydrops and appearing at festivals like Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival, and Freshgrass Festival, where they took second place in the 2016 band competition. Their lyrics find beauty and glory in the mundane, workaday struggle of everyday life: time keeps passing, you don\u2019t like your job, you drink too much, you laugh with your friends, you search for a home, and you dream about what else might be out there.

SONI withanEYE is emerging with a genre expanding collection of music that will attract listeners from house lovers to head bangers with her self-described \u201cHip Rock with a touch of Funk'n Soul.\u201d As she put the finishing touches on her debut album featuring Mobb Deep and Quest Love of The Roots to name a few, SONI withanEYE delivered a taste of what is about to come in the video for her forthcoming single \u201cGet It Together\u201d featuring the legendary Raekwon, from the Wu Tang Clan and her new video for her new single \"Rebel\" featuring cameos from Natalie of Nina Sky and video vixen Gloria Velez bringing a strong message of women empowerment through visual art and song. Born and bred in Queens, New York, Soni Guzman, known as SONI withanEYE, honed her skills in church while singing in the choir during her time at Catholic school. But it wasn\u2019t until she began playing with instruments such as the piano and guitar, which proved she had an innate talent to sing and perform. She expanded her talents of how to work a crowd even more, when added spinning records to her repartee. While continuing to live in New York and traveling the world, SONIcontinuously finds inspirations in so many sounds and cultures, which are magically reflected in her unique music. While her Puerto Rican roots are showcased in some of her past catalog of music, it\u2019s the present work she\u2019s creating that speaks to her musicianship across a myriad of genres. She credits an array of artists from David Bowie to Dolly Parton, from Madonna to Dinah Washington, and from Ray Barreto to Led Zeppelin for her eclectic love of music. \u201cI would love for my music to create emotion, joy, consciousness, compassion and influence people,\u201d SONI states, \u201cThere are many different emotions and a strong personality I project through my music, that's influenced by my experiences, friends and family, as well as the different genres I've been exposed to growing up.\u201d Inspired by her father, who played everything from the congas to saxophone, and even managed the Brooklyn Breakers, SONI withanEYE moves in the same direction by not being able to be pigeonholed into one specific genre. Although SONI withanEYE has recorded with the likes of Timberland and The Beatnuts, SONI may be predominately known for her past collaborations with Todd Terry, Tony Touch, Louie Vega and working with the legendary Jelly Bean Benitez, but her debut album will be fully decorated with flavors of Hip-Hop, House, Rock-n-Roll and R&B. While some may try to throw labels on what her music represents, Soni serves as a musical teacher of sorts, defining what she truly is: a versatile force with a voice that touches the soul with tracks like \"Here to Stay\" released by Vega Records, \u201cSilly Girl\u201d featuring Questlove of The Roots and single/video featuring Raekwon \u201cGet It Together\u201d attest to that. SONI withanEYE currently serves as the face of Cypress Hills\u2019 BReal.tv where she hosts the weekly live broadcasted \"Toca Tuesday\" during which she interviews her fellow artists and party goers as she showcases her cunning on-camera charm. SONI has also created her own Brunch Event Series called \u201cLet\u2019s Play KETCHUP\u201d and \u201cExtra Sauce\u00e8\u201d that celebrates the love for food and music.

They discovered a musical and personal kinship that they fought for years \u2013 in and amongst other commitments \u2013 to get back to. With the breakup of the bis-quits in 1994, Kimbrough went on to be lead guitarist in Todd Snider & the Nervous Wrecks. (He has since produced several of Snider\u2019s records, along with a whole slew of other artists.) Womack wrote Cheese Chronicles: The True Story of a Rock n\u2019 Roll Band You\u2019ve Never Heard Of (the story of his first band, Government Cheese. Kimbrough went on from Todd Snider\u2019s band to play with Rodney Crowell (most recently) as well as with Kim Richey, Josh Rouse and others, and to become one of the most in-demand session guitarists in Nashville, launching a successful solo career as well and getting songs cut by Jimmy Buffett, Jack Ingram and Little Feat. Womack wrote songs with Jason & the Scorchers and Dan Baird, and has been covered by Todd Snider, Scott Kempner and David Olney, among others. Drawing on Juke-Joint Blues, Country and good old Heavy Rock, DADDY (as they chose to call their new band) made its debut many years later, in 2005, with the \u201cAt The Women\u2019s Club\u201d album, recorded live in Frankfort, Kentucky.

Dion Francis DiMucci (b July 18, 1939), better known as Dion, is an American singer-songwriter, now widely recognized as one of the top singers of his era, blending the best elements of doo-wop, pop, and R&B styles. Early years Dion was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx borough of New York City. As a child, he used to accompany his father, a vaudeville entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of country music \u2013 particularly Hank Williams \u2013 and the blues and doo-wop stars he heard in local bars and on the radio. His singing abilities were honed on the street corners of Crotona Avenue, where he rounded up other local singers inventing acapella licks, and in local clubs. In early 1957 he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz, who had just formed Mohawk Records. They recorded him with a vocal group, The Timberlanes, and released a single \"The Chosen Few\", arranged by Hugo Montenegro, which became a minor regional hit. With the Belmonts, 1957-1960 Schwartz also signed up Dion's friends, The Belmonts, named after nearby Belmont Avenue. Their breakthrough together came in early 1958, when \"I Wonder Why\" made # 22 on the national US charts, followed up with \"No One Knows\" and \"Don\u2019t Pity Me\" which were also chart hits. This success won Dion and the Belmonts a place on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. On 2 February 1959, after playing at Clear Lake, Iowa, Dion decided that he could not afford the $36 cost of a flight to the next venue [1]. The plane crashed, and Holly and the other stars were killed. In March 1959, Dion and the Belmonts\u2019 next single, \"A Teenager In Love\", was released, making # 5 in the US pop charts and # 28 in the UK. Their biggest hit, \"Where or When\", was released in November 1959, and reached #3 on the US charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked in to hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful, there were musical and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960 Dion decided to quit for a solo career. Solo stardom, 1960-1964 1961 album coverBy the end of 1960, Dion had recorded and released his first solo album, Alone With Dion, and the single \"Lonely Teenager\", which rose to # 12 in the US charts. Follow-ups \"Havin\u2019 Fun\" and \"Kissin\u2019 Game\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with new vocal group the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \"Runaround Sue\", stormed up the charts, reaching # 1 in the US charts in September 1961, and # 11 in the UK, where he also toured. For the next single, the record company promoted the A-side, \"The Majestic\", but it was the B-side, Maresca\u2019s song \"The Wanderer\", which received the radio plays and again rose swiftly up the charts, reaching # 2 in the US charts in December 1961 and # 10 in the UK. As a classic oldie, it made the UK top twenty again in 1976. By the end of 1961, Dion was a major star, with a worldwide touring schedule, and he followed up with a string of hit singles \u2013 \"Lovers Who Wander\" (# 3), \"Little Diane\" (# 8), \"Love Came To Me\" (# 10) and \"Ruby Baby\" (# 2) all making the top ten in 1962. Several of these were written or co-written by Dion. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander. At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records, the first rock and roll artist ever signed to that label. Although the first single, Leiber and Stoller\u2019s \"Ruby Baby\", was a big hit, reaching # 2, several follow-ups were less so, although \"Donna the Prima Donna\" and \"Drip Drop\" both reached # 6 in the charts in late 1963. Nevertheless, problems with his addiction and changing public tastes did cause him to enter a period of commercial decline. Changing fortunes, 1964-1968 Following a European tour, Dion returned to the USA and was introduced to classic blues music by Columbia\u2019s John Hammond. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including Willie Dixon\u2019s \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"Spoonful\", but these releases \u2013 some produced by Tom Wilson, with Al Kooper on keyboards - were not commercially successful. In 1966, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts for the album Together Again on ABC Records. Again, this bombed, despite one classic self-penned song, \"My Girl The Month Of May\". Although by this stage Dion\u2019s career appeared to be nearing an end, he retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, the only pop artist featured on the album cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. In April 1968, Dion had a powerful religious experience. After getting clean from drug use, he approached Laurie Records for a new contract, and they agreed on condition that he record the song \"Abraham, Martin and John\", written by Dick Holler (also the writer of The Royal Guardsmen\u2019s \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\") in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy during the summer of 1968. The success of this song \u2013 later recorded by many others including Marvin Gaye \u2013 which reached # 4 in the US charts, resuscitated Dion\u2019s career. The mature period, 1968-1986 Born To Be With You, 1975For the next few years, Dion\u2019s music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to critical acclaim but moderate sales, moving to the Warner Brothers label in 1969. There followed a one-off live reunion show with the Belmonts at Madison Square Garden in 1972, released on album. This was followed in 1975 by the album Born To Be With You, eccentrically produced by Phil Spector. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as Jason Pierce of Spiritualized and Pete Townshend of The Who. In 1978 Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, Return of the Wanderer, another critical success and commercial failure. In December 1979 he experienced a life-changing religious experience, documented in this article [1]. Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a contemporary Christian music vein, in which he released a number of albums on the Dayspring label reflecting his religious convictions. Recent work In 1987 Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at Radio City Music Hall in New York. This helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Lou Reed, all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences. In 1988 Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled The Wanderer: Dion's Story was published. In the following year, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the induction speech being given by Lou Reed. In 1989 he returned to secular rock music with the album Yo Frankie, and since then has released several albums with contemporary rock artists. His D\u00e9j\u00e0 Nu album in 2000 found him covering Bruce Springsteen, a major follower over the years. He joined Scott Kempner of the Del-Lords and Mike Mesaros of The Smithereens in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted. In January 2006 he released Bronx in Blue, an album of blues and country standards, which was critically acclaimed and nominated for a Grammy.

The studs n\u2019 leather bedecked TRANSMETAL, founded during January 1987, have stuck to their Thrash / Speed Metal stance over nearly twenty Spanish language albums. Upon their formation TRANSMETAL was fronted by vocalist Alberto Pimentel, who featured on the 1988 debut \u2018Muerto en la Cruz\u2019, produced by Dark Angel\u2019s Eric Meyer, and the follow up \u2018Desear Un Funeral\u2019. On June 18th 1989 the group opened for Death at the Naucalpan Arena Lopez Mateos. In 1990 Pimentel departed to found LEPROSSY. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez of ILLUSION, and subsequently frontman for Arkhe, would fill the vacancy before Juan Carlos Camarena took the role of second guitarist. The band featured on the high profile \u2018New Titans Over Mexico\u2019 tour of 1991, these shows sharing billing with Sacred Reich in January, Kreator in July and Sepultura in December. On May 3rd 1992 TRANSMETAL supported Overkill at the Arena A. Lopez Mateos in Tlanepantla then appeared as part of the \u2018Mexican Mosh\u2019 festival alongside Sick of It All, Deicide and Nuclear Assault. The album that year, 'Amanecer En El Mausoleu', featured a cover version of 'Killers' by French band Killers. On November 8th the band scored the high profile support to Black Sabbath's concert at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City. 1992 witnessed the departure of these latest two recruits and Alberto Pimental resumed activities with the band on a stand in basis. A successful Mexican tour during October found TRANSMETAL headlining over Mortuary and Inquisidor. The band's status would engender a further slot at the March 1993 \u2018Mexican Mosh\u2019 festival event, this time sharing honours with OVERKILL, KREATOR and Monstrosity among others. The following year TRANSMETAL, together with fellow native acts Angeles del Infierno and Rata Blanca, represented Mexico at the June 1994 \u2018Monstruos De Rock\u2019 gathering in Spain. The group notably guested for Slayer on September 10th at the Mexico City Balneario Olimpico. Pimentel would opt out yet again to forge another version of Leprosy (spelt with one \u2018S\u2019 on this ocassion) assembling a new band including Ramses guitarist Julio Marquez and ex-INQUISIDOR drummer Felipe Chacon. TRANSMETAL took onboard the esteemed former Luzbel and Huizar frontman Arturo Huizar as their lead vocalist but by February 1998 two members of Panic, vocalist Mauricio Torres and guitarist \u2018Eric Towers\u2019 (a.k.a. Ernesto Torres) stabilised the band for the album 'Las Alas Del Emperador'. Meantime, Lorenzo Partida and ex-TRANSMETAL vocalist Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez would create the side project Ultratumba. TRANSMETAL's show at the Adolph Lopez Mateos de Tlalnepantla Arena in Mexico City in July 1999 was filmed and recorded, subsequently put out as two live discs 'dubbed XIII A\u00f1os... En Vivo - Primera Parte' and 'XIII A\u00f1os... En Vivo - Segunda Parte'. TRANSMETAL took a novel approach of recording tracks for two albums at once, 'Tristeza De Lucifer' and 'De Bajo De Los Cielos P\u00farpura', these sessions held in Hammond, Indiana with producer Mike Sheffield. Upon the release of 'Tristeza De Lucifer' the group toured South America during 2001. Shows in Bogota, Colombia, Manizales and Cal\u00ed in Colombia, River basin in Ecuador, Arequipa in Peru, La Paz and Santa Cruz in Bolivia would prove a first for a Mexican Metal band. 'De Bajo De Los Cielos P\u00farpura' then arrived in July 2000, prompting a 30 date run of shows across the USA. That same year the debut album 'Muerto En La Cruz' would see a CD re-issue, adding four extra tracks. The band's legacy would be honoured in 2001 with the delivery of no less than two tribute albums in 'Milicia Infernal... Tributo a Transmetal' and the live 'Milicia Infernal... Tributo A Transmetal (En Vivo)', both released on the Denver label. Those paying homage included LUZBEL, PANIC, Disgorge, Ricter, Allusion, ULTRATUMBA, Domain, IRA, A.N.I.M.A.L., Leprycorn and Mechanical Chaos. TRANSMETAL returned in September 2002 with the experimental 'El Amor Supremo', this album, their very first to incorporate keyboards and recorded at Studio 880 in San Pablo California, seeing production duties going to the Cancer, DEATH, Disincarnate, Testament and Konkhra credited guitarist JAMES MURPHY. The band's December 2003 album, 'Lo Podrido Corona La Inmensidad', saw keyboard contributions coming from Erick Fuentes Quintana and a guest guitar solo on the track 'Creador De La Amargura' from JAMES MURPHY. 2004 saw TRANSMETAL tackling an album, 'Temple De Acero', comprising entirely of cover versions including the Scorpions 'The Zoo', Candlemass' 'At The Gallows End', Celtic Frost's 'Return To The Eve' and 'Dethroned Emperor', Accept's 'Balls To The Wall', AC/DC's 'Back In Black' and 'Let Me Put My Love Into You', Sodom's 'Remember The Fallen', BLACK SABBATH's 'Evil Woman', DEATH's 'Evil Death', Uriah Heep's 'Free And Easy' and Twisted Sister's 'The Kids Are Back'. A notable compilation issued in June that same year, '17 Years Down In Hell', re-worked the tracks from the previous two albums, 'El Amor Supremo' and 'Lo Podrido Corona La Inmensidad', in English language. An unaccredited track, a newly recorded version of 'Aborrecer Al Forence', saw Mauricio Torres on vocals. New studio album 'El Despertar De La Adversidad' arrived in February 2006, capitalised on by a run of Mexican shows, gigs in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and spot US gigs. The band would be back in the recording studio before the end of the year cutting the 'Progresi\u00f3n Neur\u00f3tica' album for November.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 Bleecker St, New York, NY 10012", "Artist": "No\u00e9 Socha ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11489633.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7284039, -73.9992845], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Slide Blues, Accoustic, Country, Americana, Blues And Jazz, Blues, Slide Guitar", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Terra Blues with The Pioneers ", "moreBioInfo": "No\u00e9 Socha is a Brooklyn-based guitar and harmonica player originally from the small town of Carpi, Italy.

He is known as a great jazz, latin and classical pianist with superb technical ability, and has played and recorded with many world-famous musicians. Michel lists some of his main influences as Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and Art Tatum. Michel was born into a musical family and as a young child showed great aptitude for the accordion that his parents gave him. Although he enjoyed the accordion, it was his grandparents' piano that sparked his interest the most, so at aged 9 he asked his parents to buy him one. Their response was to first send him to the Elementary Music School, part of the National Conservatory, and then a year later to grant his wish. The formal system of the music school taught Michel to play in the classical style, and by aged 16 he was playing with the National Symphony Orchestra of the Dominican Republic. Michel comments on his first encounter with the sounds of jazz, in an interview with the All About Jazz website: \u201dThe first time I heard jazz was when I was 14 and a half. I heard the great Art Tatum on the radio playing his solo piano rendition of 'Tea for Two.' That immediately caught my ear. I just wanted to soak it in, to learn to play that style. Then I found out it was jazz.\u201d Michel studied for 13 years at the National Conservatory, and whilst developing his strong classical abilities was also heavily influenced by the bop tradition, and by the contemporary jazz of Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. His influences at this time also included Horace Silver, Erroll Garner, and the ragtime music of Scott Joplin. When the Harvard University Jazz Band visited the Dominican Republic and heard Michel at a jam session, the bandleader encouraged him, 'You should be in the States', and so the idea was planted. In 1979 Michel moved to New York to study at Mannes College and at The Juilliard School, and broke onto the international stage in 1983 when Tito Puente's pianist was unable to make a concert at the Montreal Jazz Festival. On a recommendation, without hearing him, Tito asked Michel to play. Cuban reedman Paquito D'Rivera was in the audience, and immediately offered him a place in his band. For four years Michel toured internationally with Paquito, and recorded two albums with him. Michel's emergence as a star in his own right began around 1985, the year he debuted with his trio at Carnegie Hall. In that same year he toured Europe with Paquito D\u2019Rivera\u2019s quintet, and recorded his first album, Why Not?, for Japan\u2019s King label. In 1988 Michel debuted on a major record label, Sony, with the release of Michel Camilo. This became a bestseller and held the top jazz album spot for ten consecutive weeks.

His songwriting uses a palette of Blues, Country, Jazz and Rock with a sensitivity and wit that has also earned him the broad fan base most instrumental guitarist never enjoy. Campilongo's career began in the mid 1970s when he studied guitar in his native San Francisco with the eccentric Bunnie Gregoire, who taught the pre-teen to embrace everything from George Van Eps to John Denver. Campilongo recalls, \"Before Bunnie I used to just randomly buy records if there weren't that many songs on them, I didn't care who the artist was. A banner day would be discovering a double album that only had two songs on it. So I ended up with John Coltrane Live in Japan and John McLaughlin's Devotion with Larry Young on organ. I listened to those records until they melted and I still do to this day (on CD). Eventually, I found Roy Buchanan's first album and all bets were off, I was going to be a guitar player.\" Jim's first instrument was purchased with Green Stamps. In addition to Chet Atkins and Roy Buchanan, Jim began to be deeply affected by Muddy Waters and the Sex Pistols. Around this time he was given a 1959 Telecaster by an appreciative student in exchange for successful bass lessons. \"Playing that '59 Tele changed everything for me,\" Campilongo remembers, \"It was like it told me to get serious.\" Soon after, he formed the hugely popular Ten Gallon Cats, which featured pedal steel guitar and Jim's ever-expanding Country/Jazz vocabulary. They recorded three CDs. Jim broke from the Cats and reached a creative pinnacle in his existing body of work with 1998's Table For One, a collection of winsome and elegant compositions praised by Billboard as, \"Americana at its most touching\". Guitar Player affirmed the CD as a showcase for Campilongo's \"darkly romantic melodicism\". The record also garnered Campilongo a new level of recognition. In 2002, Campilongo pulled up stakes and moved to New York, where he formed his Electric Trio, which toured Europe and Scandinavia and recorded the acclaimed CD American Hips, lauded by Guitar Player as \"easily his best effort to date\". No Depression raved, \"Campilongo meets himself every time he picks up his instrument; that brand of artistic bravery is rare and to be treasured.\" Since 2004 the \"Campy Trio\" reigns each Monday night at New York's Living Room, a residency that Time Out New York recommended as \"one of the city's strongest\". Jim's new CD, entitled Heaven is Creepy is set for an August, 2006 release.

He is known as a great jazz, latin and classical pianist with superb technical ability, and has played and recorded with many world-famous musicians. Michel lists some of his main influences as Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and Art Tatum. Michel was born into a musical family and as a young child showed great aptitude for the accordion that his parents gave him. Although he enjoyed the accordion, it was his grandparents' piano that sparked his interest the most, so at aged 9 he asked his parents to buy him one. Their response was to first send him to the Elementary Music School, part of the National Conservatory, and then a year later to grant his wish. The formal system of the music school taught Michel to play in the classical style, and by aged 16 he was playing with the National Symphony Orchestra of the Dominican Republic. Michel comments on his first encounter with the sounds of jazz, in an interview with the All About Jazz website: \u201dThe first time I heard jazz was when I was 14 and a half. I heard the great Art Tatum on the radio playing his solo piano rendition of 'Tea for Two.' That immediately caught my ear. I just wanted to soak it in, to learn to play that style. Then I found out it was jazz.\u201d Michel studied for 13 years at the National Conservatory, and whilst developing his strong classical abilities was also heavily influenced by the bop tradition, and by the contemporary jazz of Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea. His influences at this time also included Horace Silver, Erroll Garner, and the ragtime music of Scott Joplin. When the Harvard University Jazz Band visited the Dominican Republic and heard Michel at a jam session, the bandleader encouraged him, 'You should be in the States', and so the idea was planted. In 1979 Michel moved to New York to study at Mannes College and at The Juilliard School, and broke onto the international stage in 1983 when Tito Puente's pianist was unable to make a concert at the Montreal Jazz Festival. On a recommendation, without hearing him, Tito asked Michel to play. Cuban reedman Paquito D'Rivera was in the audience, and immediately offered him a place in his band. For four years Michel toured internationally with Paquito, and recorded two albums with him. Michel's emergence as a star in his own right began around 1985, the year he debuted with his trio at Carnegie Hall. In that same year he toured Europe with Paquito D\u2019Rivera\u2019s quintet, and recorded his first album, Why Not?, for Japan\u2019s King label. In 1988 Michel debuted on a major record label, Sony, with the release of Michel Camilo. This became a bestseller and held the top jazz album spot for ten consecutive weeks. Other bestselling albums followed and so did the accolades, including a Grammy and an Emmy. Michel's collaborative 2000 album with flamenco guitarist Tomatito, Spain won Best Latin Jazz Album in the first Latin Grammy Awards. As well as being an outstanding performer, Michel is a talented composer and has written scores for several Spanish language films including Los Peores A\u00f1os de Nuestra Vida and the award-winning Amo Tu Cama Rica. Michel tours extensively, and lectures in Europe, the US and in the Puerto Rico Conservatory. He holds several honorary degrees, a Visiting Professorship at Berklee College of Music, and has been honored in his home country by being named a Knight of the Heraldic Order of Christopher Columbus, and being awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez & Mella.

Drive. Determination. That\u2019s what Leanne Weiss and Derek Allan bring to country music. You won\u2019t find them sitting still, nor can you try to stop them. Long before their formation as country duo October Rose, these two were separately chasing similar dreams with the same level of ambition, but in different states. Growing up in the suburbs of Northern New Jersey, Leanne idolized vocalists like Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, writing songs through her teenage years and performing wherever she could in whatever genre she could. After a bout of divine inspiration, Weiss took a chance and recorded her first country EP. \u201cI saw Carrie Underwood in concert, and couldn\u2019t sleep that night. My desire to pursue my dreams was so strong.\u201d Weiss quickly garnered opening slots for Kenny Rogers, Dierks Bentley, and Kristian Bush of Sugarland and shows at classic venues like Nashville\u2019s The Bluebird. Despite her success, she considered throwing in the towel and putting her music career on hold. \u201cI was feeling frustrated,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what my next move would be after three years of recording and performing.\u201d Three hundred and sixty five miles away in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Derek was on a musical journey that began at age elven when his mom gave him a gift that would change his life\u2014his first guitar. \u201cShe bought my dad, my brother, and me guitars for my dad\u2019s birthday,\u201d Derek recalls. \u201cI started taking lessons.\u201d He actively honed his skills as a musician, songwriter, singer\u2014and bodybuilder. Though growing up partial to 80\u2019s hair metal bands like Warrant and Def Leppard, it was undeniable that country music was in his blood. Before long, Derek was performing his original songs and quickly establishing himself in Pittsburgh music scene. Opening slots for prominent bands like The Stickers were paving the way for him to make his mark in his home city. Then in early 2016, a job change brought Derek to New Jersey, unaware of the story that fate had in store for both he and Leanne. After stumbling across Leanne\u2019s music video, Derek contacted her via Facebook, wanting to make some new friends in country music. The two chatted and Derek came out to one of her shows. \u201cI wound up sitting next to her mom, who talked her daughter up,\u201d says Derek. When Leanne took the stage with her band, Derek knew mom was right. The two met after the show and became fast friends, hanging out and writing music together. \u201cWhen we started harmonizing together, it was like the world stopped,\u201d says Leanne. \u201cWe knew we had something incredible.\u201d Suffice it to say, she wasn\u2019t about to give up on music anytime soon, and fate was moving her into a new direction. Derek knew then his move to New Jersey was his destiny. But could they abandon the solo careers they had built and form a brand new duo? ?Their answer to that is reflected in the first song they ever wrote together. \u2018\u201cHeartbreak Song\u2019 is so special to us because it symbolizes the leap of faith we took in our musical relationship,\u201d says Derek. The two had plotted out their goals and strategized their musical game plan that summer. Without hesitation, they announced their debut at a New York City show in October 2016 in front of friends and family. It was clear they had made the right decision. ?Since their formation, October Rose\u2019s momentum grows stronger by the day. \u201cHeartbreak Song,\u201d the emotional song that started it all, is gaining critical acclaim and traction on the country music charts. And with a rigorous schedule of performing all over the country, this duo continues to win audiences over with their energetic stage performances. \u201cWe\u2019ve already opened for awesome acts like Jake Owen, Drew Baldridge, Russell Dickerson, Jimmie Allen, and Jordan Davis,\u201c Leanne says of their performance credits. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring our fans new music.\u201d ? Their debut EP, \u201cAll In\u201d features six songs, including the motivational title track. \u201c\u2019All In\u201d is our follow-up to \u2018Heartbreak Song,\u201d in that it epitomizes the strength of our partnership as a duo and our desire to go \u2018all in\u2019 with our dreams,\u201d says Derek. Produced, engineered, and mixed by Chris Badami of Portrait Recording Studios, their debut EP is a labor of love and a testament to their unique style of writing and performing. With their unmistakable chemistry and a contagious, rock-infused sound, October Rose is undoubtedly a formidable and unstoppable presence in country music. It\u2019s clear to see that the same fate that brought them together will move them toward their mutual dream. Currently, October Rose is on the road and releasing new music in 2020.", "otherInfo": "October Rose performs for the Morris Township Outdoor Concert Series at Ginty Field.

Organized by post-bop pianist Marc Cary, The Harlem Sessions (originating at Gin Fizz and now based at Smoke Jazz Club) invites musicians, poets, artists, philosophers and dancers to build and explore a new common repertoire with original ensemble arrangements. A key player in galvanizing this fresh and dynamic sense of cultural awareness, drummer/composer Curtis Nowosad was on hand anchoring the groove every week during the gathering\u2019s first years \u2013 and he\u2019s still part of the action today. Having made his home in Harlem since 2013 when he was working on his masters at the Manhattan School of Music, the 31-year-old Canadian native emerges as a powerful musical force for social justice on a groundbreaking self-titled jazz and blues-driven collection that illuminates past and present American history while creating some profound history of its own. While it may seem curious to some that Curtis would self-title his third overall album, it\u2019s reflective of a desire to share his deeper core identity. He imparts his truth and the issues that have long mattered to him via five impactful originals and edgy, intensely rendered versions of three thematically related pieces: Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s \u201cHome is Where the Hatred Is,\u201d Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Co-produced with Cary, it\u2019s also the drummer\u2019s first collection to feature the explosive and intuitive chemistry of his NY-based ensemble that has held court in NYC everywhere from Smalls, Fat Cat and Rockwood Music Hall to The Jazz Standard and full week residencies at Dizzy\u2019s Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center. The group includes Duane Eubanks (trumpet), Braxton Cook (alto sax), Andrew Renfroe (guitar), Jonathan Thomas (piano, Fender Rhodes, organ) and Luke Sellick (bass). Guests include Corey Wallace (trombone), Matthew Whitaker (organ) and vocalists Michael Mayo (whose beautiful wordless vocal brings a rich humanity to \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d and \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d) and Brianna Thomas, who brings the burning soul-blues angles and edges to \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues\u201d and \u201cSee Line Woman.\u201d Cary himself guests on Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer and synth. Curtis laid the foundation for this current release with two previous critically acclaimed collections, his debut The Skeptic & the Cynic (which spent two weeks at #1 on the Canadian Jazz charts and featured Grammy-nominated pianist Taylor Eigsti) and the WCMA-winning and JUNO-nominated Dialectics (Cellar Live), which made DownBeat Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest of 2015\u201d list, reached #3 on the CMJ jazz charts and spent ten weeks on the JazzWeek charts. The Skeptic & the Cynic was comprised mostly of cover songs by Michael Jackson, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Pink Floyd, Black Star and 2Pac, along with two originals. Recorded in Winnipeg in 2014 after Curtis\u2019 first year at Manhattan School of Music, Dialectics featured mostly original music along with arrangements of compositions by Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter and the jazz standard \u201cI Remember You.\u201d \u201cI recorded my first two albums in my hometown of Winnipeg,\u201d Curtis says, \u201cwith a band made up of my former teachers from the University of Manitoba. Those works were geared towards my growth as a musician and gaining a deeper knowledge of jazz. Stylistically, the new one is definitely a departure from those, yet is a much better reflection of who I am and the themes and issues that matter to me. It\u2019s more important to me than just, \u2018here are some new songs.\u2019 These social issues were always simmering in my mind, and I was very vocal about them among the people I know and love, but it took a while before I was able to convey my feelings musically. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve lived a lot of life between the release of Dialectics and now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of life and musical experience and been through a lot, so it felt appropriate to self-title the album. The music is very personal to me. I have gained a lot of insight living in Harlem for the past 5 1/2 years, and as a European-descended practitioner of Black American Music, I feel it is my duty to approach this music and these themes in a respectful, earnest and serious manner. I also feel that as I have made the transition from being an \u2018outsider looking in\u2019 (being from Canada) to an \u2018insider looking out,\u2019 so to speak, I have a unique perspective that I have chosen to express with this album.\u201d Understanding the world from Curtis\u2019 perspective will no doubt prompt listeners not only to enjoy some of the most inventive, hard-hitting jazz they\u2019ve heard in a long time, but also to start Googling and brushing up on their social history. Four of his five originals are devoted to activists who gave their lives or livelihoods to the struggle for a better planet. The dreamy and mystical, then percussively busier and bustling \u201cThe Water Protectors\u201d is dedicated to the Standing Rock Sioux and all other indigenous people in the U.S., Canada and worldwide who are fighting for their rights to exist without encroachment. Ranging from lilting and simmering gospel to fiery bebop to an electric piano, organ and affected saxophone jam, \u201cNever Forget What They Did to Fred Hampton\u201d reflects both the forward thinking, socially conscious vision and the violent chaos that beset the Black Panther movement. Curtis composed the track on the anniversary of the FBI\u2019s assassination of Hampton, one of the movement\u2019s young, charismatic leaders who was head of the Chicago Chapter of the Party when he was gunned down in December 1969, at the age of 21. \u201cHis murder must be remembered and understood as we celebrate his message and vision of a brighter future for African Americans and all people devoted to justice and solidarity,\u201d the drummer says. The emotional, deeply soulful ballad \u201cSong 4 Marielle Franco\u201d is dedicated to Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who was the leading voice in her country against police brutality and corruption before her assassination in March 2018. \u201cBlues 4 Colin K\u201d is a lively, high energy blues romp with a hypnotic soul transporting melody designed to shed light on former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who like Muhammad Ali fifty years before him, was robbed of his best years of competing for taking a stand (via taking a knee during the national anthem) against injustice and the oppression of Black people. Curtis balances the heavy themes with a personal statement of a different kind, the romantic and whimsical \u201cWaltz 4 Meg,\u201d dedicated to his wife Megan, whom he has known for over half his life. Curtis, who started playing drums at 12 and picked up piano at 16, grew up in Winnipeg, the son of a piano teacher mother and saxophonist father. While he grew up hearing jazz around the house, Curtis opted instead for bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Yet his mindset shifted quickly from hard rock to jazz when he heard Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, particularly their 1963 album Caravan. \u201cI liked John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and started learning with records I checked out of the public library,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was something about Blakey being a thunderous drummer and bandleader that tapped into my spirit and made me realize I wanted to be that kind of musician as well. Why jazz? Its sense of freedom just spoke to me, and I think that\u2019s what attracts a lot of people. There are no limits. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with a lot of New York musicians when I was in high school and college, and that played a large part as well.\u201d Establishing himself on the NY jazz scene, Curtis has played in the bands of Philip Harper, Craig Harris, rising star saxophonist Braxton Cook and renowned pianist Marc Cary (who both make major contributions to the album) while headlining major jazz festivals in Canada and several in the U.S. He has also performed with four NEA Jazz Masters: Candido Camero, Dave Liebman, Jimmy Owens and Kenny Barron. A recipient of several awards and scholarships, in 2014 Nowosad performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam as a winner of the Keep an Eye Jazz Award. He was twice selected to participate in Betty Carter's Jazz Ahead at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and also attended the Banff Jazz Workshop. Curtis is an alumnus of the University of Manitoba, where he studied with Terreon Gully and Quincy Davis, and holds a master\u2019s degree from Manhattan School of Music, where he was a student of John Riley, and performed with the multi-Grammy nominated MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of Bobby Sanabria. He currently serves on MSM\u2019s Precollege jazz faculty and is an endorser of Canopus Drums. \u201cFrom a purely musical standpoint, this album was creatively fulfilling because it was the first time that I had handled all of the audio editing myself, which was quite a task because there are so many layers, from horns to vocals to electronic sounds,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cIt was a challenge to figure out how to bring the right people into unique configurations for each song so that we could best bring their artistry to life, and we were still adding guests a week before the recording session. It was going to be a purely instrumental project until Marc and I talked about adding vocals \u2013 which led us to bring the incomparable Michael Mayo and Brianna Thomas on board. \u201cThematically, my feeling is that if we never deal with history we will never know how to grow and move forward as a society\u201d he adds. \u201cOne of the problems in the U.S, Canada and many other countries is that we don\u2019t do nearly enough to understand that history and take the necessary steps toward dismantling systems of oppression. Jazz has always inherently reflected the times it\u2019s created in, but often when it\u2019s institutionalized in colleges and university programs, we tend to focus on jazz history alone as opposed to the American and world history it emerges from. I hope this project will inspire listeners to read up on the different icons I was inspired to write about, and open their eyes and ears to not only what was going on in previous generations but also today. By better understanding those important connections, we can collectively begin to question all the societal structures around us.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Marc Cohn ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7788422.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "City Winery New York", "moreBioInfo": "After winning a GRAMMY for his soulful ballad \u201cWalking in Memphis,\u201d Marc Cohn solidified his place as one of this generation\u2019s most compelling singer/songwriters, combining the precision of a brilliant tunesmith with the passion of a great soul man. He\u2019s a natural storyteller, balancing the exuberant with the poignant, and able to distill universal truth out of his often romantic, drawn-from-life tales.

His captivating voice, great ear for harmonies, and melodic guitar playing make him a sought-after collaborator. With Anais Mitchell, he wrote and recorded Child Ballads, an album of English traditional folk songs that was lauded with a prestigious BBC2-Folk Award. His duo with Eamon O\u2019Leary, The Murphy Beds, has toured extensively across the USA and Europe, opening for Glen Hansard, Bonnie \u2018Prince\u2019 Billy, Beth Orton, and Sam Amidon. He recently recorded with grammy-winning folk artist Sarah Jarosz, and has released LP\u2019s with Session Americana and Laura Cortese. His first solo record of original songs, Alameda, was released in 2018. The songs on Alameda are largely road stories, celebrating the lives of people on the fringes of society. For the New Yorker, Robert Sullivan writes, \u201c\u2018Alameda,\u2019 the title track on Hamer\u2019s album, is a rock ballad with crispy guitar licks and geographic lyrics about a wandering worker, who is maybe the author, but maybe not. In the way that it talks about a long search for work, it reminds me of Woody Guthrie\u2019s Columbia River song series\u2026\u201d Propelled by tasteful electric and acoustic guitar, Hamer\u2019s rapport with the traditional ballads (he is a regular singer and guitar accompanist at several weekly NYC Irish music sessions) shines on original narratives like \u2018Alameda\u2019 and the sweeping \u2018Champlain,\u2019 a cross-country love story that begins lakeside on the border between Vermont and New York. Bassist Jeff Picker (Ricky Skaggs, Sarah Jarosz) and drummer John Fatum (The Rad Trads) form a powerful, responsive rhythm section. The album was entirely self-produced, engineered, and mixed by Hamer in New York\u2019s Lethe Lounge studio. Overdubs are few, but a small gathering of New York and Boston luminaries add their signatures; Jim Fitting\u2019s (Session Americana, Treat Her Right) harmonica shines on \u2018Moving Day\u2019, and Alec Spiegelman (Cuddle Magic) plays flute and bass clarinet on several tracks including \u2018Vagabond\u2019, an energetic singalong dealing with themes of migration and displacement. Exquisite harmony vocals are furnished by Hannah Read and Sarah Jarosz. Alameda tells carefully written stories that bear repeated listening, infusing songwriter narratives with amplified live-band excitement. \u201cJefferson uses his warm voice and lyrical guitar to tell stories and paint human pictures\u2026 His guitar has that rippling twang and flow of electric Richard Thompson.\u201d -Marc Higgins / fatea magazine \u201cA gifted guitarist and singer, Hamer is able to hit close harmonies and weave gorgeous instrumental lines.\u201d -Acoustic Guitar \u201cA spellbinding guitarist and songwriter\u201d \u2013Brooklynbased.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "149 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215", "Artist": "Robert Dean ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [40.6737185, -73.9916803], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Bell House", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Dan Joe DVD Show \u2022Tuesday, July 27\u30fb7:00pm Doors\u30fb8:00pm Show"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Peter Asher ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617156.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop, Rock, Classical", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "City Winery New York", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "25 11th Ave, New York, NY 10011", "Artist": "Company ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9620434.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7430564, -74.0090477], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "City Winery New York", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "709 Lorimer St, Brooklyn, NY 11211", "Artist": "Will Leet ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11493595.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.7180854, -73.95025059999999], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Alt-country, Pop Rock, Folk Rock, Americana, Rock & Folk, Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Will Leet at Pete\u2019s Candy Store", "moreBioInfo": "Will Leet is a NYC based singer-songwriter, formerly known as Instant Treeline.
