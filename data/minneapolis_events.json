The Tommy Bentz is a fantastic power trio that has been in existence for over 15 years, jamming in the style of \"the Allman Brothers meets Van Morrison\". Tommy leads the band as the singer/songwriter/guitarist whose professional soloing chops radiate throughout the band's performance. A standout slide player, Tommy has often been touted as one of the best in the Midwest. His seemingly effortless style ranges from strident and thick \"Clapton-esque\" lines and tone to satisfyingly classic rock 'n roll. Tommy grew up enthralled with the guitarists in the Allman Brothers Band and the great British blues rockers \u2014 Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and, especially, Cream-era Eric Clapton. Tommy focuses this power into a tight, focused wall of sound with his amazingly talented trio of musicians. Jason McLean's melodic and groovy bass lines and harmony vocals combine perfectly with Alex Burgess's rock-solid, musical percussion talents and spot-on background vocals. The band combines all of their years of musical performance into a tight, energized, soulful, live musical package like none other you've heard before. Amazing musicians in their own right, the group has 4 original CDs under their belts, as well as a full-length performance DVD, but boasts a list of covers that would make any lover of blues-rock drool in anticipation - from Hendrix, SRV, Cream/Clapton, Stones, Beatles, The Band and so, so many more. The shows include songs Bentz has written and recorded, mainly bluesy rock that spotlights his impeccable work on guitar, an instrument he didn\u2019t take up until his mid-teens. While reading Bentz's lyrics, one gets a snapshot of his ideals - from the strength he derives from family ties to the always present issue of respect in this ever changing world. The audience are then left with the impression of a man who has learned much from where he's been, has processed that knowledge and now presses forward into the unknown with great purpose. If lyrics alone drove Bentz's work, the product would be wonderful, but combined with their technical musical prowess, warm and soulful vocals, southern jam style blues-rock combined with acoustic singer/songwriter flair...the audience is given a magically wide-ranged musical evening that truly is the Tommy Bentz Band experience.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2528 Nicollet Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55404", "Artist": "David Huckfelt Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11235851.jpeg", "Coordinates": [44.9563234, -93.2780612], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country, Appalachian, Folk, Delta Blues, Indie Folk, Blues, Rock, Bluegrass, Ambient", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Icehouse Patio", "moreBioInfo": "In a career on the road less traveled that has found him sharing stages with a staggering diversity of artists: from Mavis Staples, Emmylou Harris & Greg Brown, to Bon Iver, Arcade Fire & Gregory Alan Isakov, and more recently an impressive array of Native American musicians including John Trudell, Quiltman, Keith Secola, and Annie Humphrey, Huckfelt wanted to build a new musical community for this collection of songs. While his 2018 solo debut record \u201cStranger Angels\u201d was written in complete isolation at Isle Royale National Park on Lake Superior just a few miles from the Canadian border, \u201cRoom Enough, Time Enough\u201d was created in the borderlands of southern Arizona, in the musical mecca of Tucson, the high Sonoran Desert and one of the richest, most biodiverse ecosystems in the world. He asked Tucson producer and multi-instrumentalist Gabriel Sullivan (XIXA) to open up Dust + Stone Studios to a host of friends, contemporaries, strangers, artists, outlaws, cowboys, and Native musicians: Ojibwe ambassador of Native Americana music Keith Secola, Tucson's own living songwriting legend Billy Sedlmayr, Giant Sand founder and head purveyor of the southwestern electric-fuzz border sound Howe Gelb; former Bob Dylan drummer Winston Watson, and Calexico hired guns Connor Gallaher on pedal steel and Jon Villa on trumpet. Together with the unmatched vocal chants of John Trudell's constant collaborator & Warm Springs Nation Native singer Quiltman, these songs found their people and vice versa in a perfect storm of generosity, fierceness and compassion.

Inspired by artists like Luka Bloom and Throwing Muses, Leslie became the principal songwriter, singer and guitarist for bands such as Emily Ryder, A Little Of The Ready and the Celtic folk band Hounds of Finn, recording on various labels including Immortal Recordings, Time To Be Proud Records, New Folk Records and Loud Folk Records. He founded the Rocket Soul Choir in 1994, mainly as an acoustic response to the heavy, guitar-driven, Irish bands cropping up at that time. Even while Leslie recorded solo albums, played in other projects and relocated to Minneapolis, the Rocket Soul Choir continued in various configurations over the years--always with the mission to create stripped-down rock. The band has released four albums, including the 2016 EP Kidder's Son, which received high praise on both sides of the pond, and their new album The Butcher Boy--the first featuring the current lineup. When not making music, Leslie loves to bake and cook and claims his best songs have come from picking up a guitar while waiting on a cheesecake to come out of the oven. Pete Boulger (drums, percussion, keyboards) joined the band in 2015 and has been a key component of the songwriting process ever since. Originally from Duluth, MN, he draws on wide-ranging influences, including the lush pop of Jellyfish and the glam-rock of bands like T-Rex and NY Dolls. He has been in a multitude of Twin Cities bands such as Church Of Cash, Sawbones, Dander and The Grande Machine. Along with the Rocket Soul Choir, he also performs with Rich Yarges & The Pop Mechanics and Jim Crego and The North Electric. Outside of music, he loves all things cheesy from the 70s and 80s. Pete also loves to cook--everything from award-winning chili to homemade pasta and smoked meats. Atom Robinson (bass, vocals, piano, organ) is a multi-instrumentalist and recording engineer who joined the band in 2018 as the bassist. Born and raised in Wisconsin playing coronet and string bass, he went to college in Illinois, spent some lost years in Iowa and then moved to St. Paul, where he has been ever since, playing electric bass and dabbling in lap steel guitar, electronic music, guitar, accordion, piano and organ. He has recorded, performed, and toured nationally and internationally with roots rock bands, a Prince tribute band, jazz ensembles, pop geniuses, liturgical music ensembles, and a rock and roll choir. As a bandleader, he fronts Doctor Lock, blanc blank, and The Atom Robinson Electric Freak Out Experience. Atom has been called a \u201cfreaking delight\u201d by all members of the band.

He injured his hand when helping his dad on the family farm. The physician recommended guitar playing for rehabilitation, and a few weeks later, Sampson came home from the music store with a new guitar. His younger brother Brian threw a fit, and was appeased with a shiny drum set. And so the seeds of Six Mile Grove were planted. The brothers spent years pounding away on their instruments in the kitchen of their great grandmother\u2019s old house, as well as singing in church with their mom, an organist and devoted music lover. Soon Brian\u2019s friend Barry, from across the woods, wanted to join the noise, and so his years of piano lessons began paying off. The boys realized they would need a bass player, put an ad in the paper, and dug up Dezi Wallace from the \u201cbig city\u201d of Austin, MN, who arrived courtesy of his mom, as he did not yet have a driver\u2019s license. Fast forward 20 years, and Six Mile Grove has a lot to be proud of. They have weathered the ever changing music scene as a primarily self-managed, self-produced, and self-recorded band. Their music has evolved accordingly, as an organic, honest voice that has not been tinkered with or tainted by the lure of record labels or flashy music producers. You\u2019re sure to find influences of Minnesota music\u2019s founding fathers; from Bob Dylan to the Jayhawks. Six Mile Grove honors it\u2019s roots, but has also managed to forge it\u2019s own sound and space on a stage without compromise. In addition, their friendship, touring and recording with legendary Johnny Cash guitarist Bob Wootton, has lended even more distinctly to their \u201cgood all-American boy\u201d sound and style. Six Mile Grove is releasing it\u2019s seventh album this Summer 2017. In this album, Sampson muses on the responsibilities of providing for a family, keeping love alive, and fighting for what\u2019s right in the world. These themes resonate with all the members of the band, as guys with day jobs, wives and kids. You\u2019ll hear the whines and growls in Nelson\u2019s piano and lead guitar licks; the take-it-easy pace of Wallace\u2019s bass, the newly added color of John Wheeler\u2019s steel guitar and the simple to furious tempos in Brian Sampson\u2019s drums. As Wootton states, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing fancy about them and they don\u2019t try to be something they\u2019re not.

In the full gospel church of her childhood, she played saxophone and drums and found her singing voice and a passion for music. Her first show was in Knoxville, TN, and then it was on to Minneapolis. Since then, she\u2019s been featured on NPR\u2019s \u201cFavorite Sessions,\u201d CMT, American Songwriter, the London Times, Paste Magazine and others. Chastity has toured the U.S. and abroad, appearing on the U.K.\u2019s Later\u2026with Jools Holland. For much of 2016, she toured alongside folk icon/activist Ani Difranco. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve realized is that the personal is political,\u201d Brown said in a recent interview. \u201cJust by me being a bi-racial, half-black, half-white woman living in America right now is political. Just being a person of color, a queer woman of color, for that matter, is freaking political. My focus, as far as this record, I guess it\u2019s really been psychological. I\u2019m really intrigued by the perseverance of the human spirit and the complexities and contradictions that we embody as human beings.\" \"Silhouette of Sirens is comprised of snapshots of memory, both lived and imagined. Not all of these tunes derive from this, which is why I say, \u2018both lived and imagined.' Some are love/sex/relationship-inspired, which in my opinion make the pain one might experience more bearable. In James Baldwin\u2019s essay, \u2018The Artist Struggle for Integrity,' he says, 'I tell you my pain so that I might relieve you of yours.'\" Light is a central character on Silhouette of Sirens. Even the title speaks to this push and pull between danger and safety, shadows and shiny lights, and the things we can reach out and touch as opposed to the things we only hear in the distance. \u201cWhat is even happening? One can only guess,\u201d Brown sings in the opening track \u201cDrive Slow,\u201d embracing an uncertainty and sense of wonder from the beginning of the record. By the third track, she\u2019s carrying us along with her on a journey inward. Like many masterful songwriters, she has the ability to make her stories feel intensely personal yet open-ended; even in \u201cCarried Away,\u201d it\u2019s hard to tell whether she\u2019s singing about a romantic rift, an abusive friendship, or the havoc that anxiety and depression can wreak on an unguarded mind. \" \u201cDon\u2019t leave me here all alone / For so long you\u2019ve been my light in the dark,\u201d Brown sings on the album\u2019s centerpiece, \u201cMy Stone,\u201d while the sexy, Prince-channeling acoustic funk jam \u201cWhisper\u201d beckons the listener to come closer, to dance with her in the dark, to \u201cwhisper in my ear all that you need.\" \u201cI think it\u2019s about different types of heartbreak, and how one deals with it,\u201d Brown says of the album. \u201cAnd not the heartbreak of a coupled relationship; just living life, and the experiences that break your heart. There are these moments on the album where it\u2019s like, \u2018this is intense.' And then hopefully, there are moments where it\u2019s alleviated \u2014 as I feel like life is. Life is hard. Every tree, every plant, everything you see in the natural world, just through a growth process, you see how hard it is to grow and bend towards the light.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "21050 135th Ave N, Rogers, MN 55374", "Artist": "Maiden Dixie ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11533449.jpeg", "Coordinates": [45.2005839, -93.5472041], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country Rock, Country And Rock, Blues, Rock, Country", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Short Or Tall Music Fest", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "6161 Hwy 65 NE, Minneapolis, MN 55432", "Artist": "Tom Hunter ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [45.0792034, -93.2430078], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Crooners Lounge and Supper Club", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Newly remodeled classic nightclub featuring raised ceilings, luxury booths, tiered seating, and state-of-the-art sound and lights."}, {"Address": "1237 WI-35, Hudson, WI 54016", "Artist": "Tim Sigler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11517304.jpeg", "Coordinates": [45.0426043, -92.7575306], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "ERIC CHURCH TRIBUTE ***TENT PARTY*** @ Big Guys Hudson (ALL CHURCHED UP)", "moreBioInfo": "With roughly 200 shows per year, Tim Sigler is bound to have a show coming up in your area sometime soon...Whether it's George Strait, Garth Brooks, Johnny Cash, or Keith Urban, etc\u2014The Tim Sigler Band plays all of your favorite country songs!
