They play pop-influenced punk music with crooning vocals and sappy, romantic lyrics. The core of the group is composed of brothers Matt Caterer (b. 1968), Josh Caterer (b. 1972) and Eli Caterer (b. 1975). The Caterer brothers were raised on rock 'n' roll and crooners like Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra. In 1980 Matt got a guitar, Josh a bass guitar and Eli a drum set and they began to play together. Soon after, their eyes were opened to the world of the Ramones and punk rock. Other early musical influences included Mel Torm\u00e9, Tom Waits, The Replacements, The Smiths, early AC/DC, The Cars, and Dinosaur Jr. In 1990 Matt and Josh, calling themselves Speedstick, got a gig at a party and played approximately 10 original punk-style compositions. About this time, Matt switched to bass and Dave Martens joined as drummer. Josh became an Elvis Costello fan and his style, accordingly, became more pop influenced. Speedstick recorded 10 songs in their first studio session, including \"Brand New Hairstyle,\" which would become a staple of the Smoking Popes repertoire. They changed the band's name, taking \"Smoking\" from Matt and Josh's penchant for excessive cigarette smoking and \"Popes\" from the movie \"The Pope of Greenwich Village.\" (The band's original name was simply the \"Popes\", but it was decided to add the adjective to distinguish the band from the Chicago gang The Popes.) Martens, disenchanted with the band's musical direction, stopped attending rehearsals and the Caterers recruited Mike Felumlee of Article One to replace him. In 1991, the band released five tracks recorded during their Speedstick days as the Innoculator EP, with local indie label Radius Records. With the proceeds and what other funding they could scratch together, the Smoking Popes bankrolled the recording of the Break Up EP in 1992. In February Eli Caterer joined as a second guitarist and in October Break Up was released. They played as often as possible in the Chicago area and ventured occasionally to small venues in Indiana and Tennessee. In 1993 the band recorded their best-yet compositions on the 2 EP. They also recorded a split 7\" single with Groovy Love Vibes. GLV vocalist Erik Pertl guested on the Popes' track \"Leather and Lace\" and Josh guested on the GLV track \"Goodtime Music.\" The band got a break when pop punk icon Ben Weasel of Screeching Weasel became a fan and used his connections to recruit Mass Giorgini of Squirtgun to produce the Smoking Popes' first LP, Get Fired. With their improved status, the band scored a three-week tour with The Bollweevils and played to bigger audiences. That year also saw the release of two Popes tracks from the same sessions as the Break Up EP. \"Run Away\" and \"Let's Hear It for Love\" appeared on the \"It's a Punk Thing... You Wouldn't Understand\" compilation on Shakefork Records. For the follow-up to Get Fired the band worked with producer Phil Bonnet, who also produced much of their early material. \"Need you Around,\" which would later launch Smoking Popes to a huge audience via the soundtrack to the movie Clueless, was recorded in December. In early 1994 the band opened for Green Day, who extended the invitation after hearing Get Fired. In mid-1994 the Popes finished their new album, Born to Quit. After \"Need You Around\" took off on alternative radio, they opened for Elastica and gained the attention of record label scouts. They signed with Capitol Records, which rereleased Born to Quit. In a promotional blitz, they toured America with the Goo Goo Dolls and Tripping Daisy. In 1996 The Clueless soundtrack was released in the UK and \"Need You Around\" was dropped as a single to capitalize on their newfound popularity there. It was promptly designated \"Single of the Week\" by the New Musical Express. They toured England and Scotland for a couple of weeks, then crossed back over the Pond to tour with Jawbreaker. Despite the touring, album sales didn't meet Capitol's expectations and it became clear that the band had to deliver a hit. Producer Jerry Finn, who had added gloss to the sound of Green Day and Rancid, was brought in to do the same for Smoking Popes. In September they toured with labelmates Jimmy Eat World. The start of 1997 brought dissatisfied label execs who insisted they didn't hear a single among the tracks Smoking Popes submitted for the new album. The band spent six months writing and demoing songs until Capitol was finally determined that new song \"I Know You Love Me\" had commercial potential. However, the label fired the Popes' A&R representative and the new album was shelved. After negotiations, Destination Failure was released in August. At this point Tom Counihan, a.k.a Tom Daily, joined the band as a touring guitarist. In October they began to tour with alternative icon Morrissey, who said of Born to Quit, \"[it's] extraordinary, the most lovable thing I'd heard in years.\" Album sales picked up and the band garnered new fans at every stop. Still, the label couldn't be convinced to devote significant resources to promotion. In 1998 the band toured with Triple Fast Action and Menthol. Afterward, the band decided to record a covers album, which would fulfill their contract with Capitol. Around this time Josh became very involved in Christianity and wanted to devote his work to his faith. The label rejected the new album but released Smoking Popes from their contract. The band played several large shows before Josh quit, effectively breaking up the band. In a later interview, Josh commented about this time \"I became a Christian in May 1998 and I quit the Popes in January 1999. I tried to incorporate my faith into what we were doing in the Popes, but it just didn't seem like a good fit.\" In 2001, record label Double Zero finally released the covers album The Party's Over. In November of 2005 the Smoking Popes reunited for a packed and much-anticipated show at the Chicago club The Metro with Rob Kellenberger replacing Mike Felumlee on drums. The tickets sold out in a mere 36 minutes. In that show \u2014 immortalized on a DVD called At Metro, bundled with a CD of the performance \u2014 Josh, Matt and Eli were conspicuously happy and energized. Eli remarked that he hadn't had that much fun in seven years, a reference to the time since the band's previous break-up. Josh has become somewhat more accepting of much of the music of his former band, and the Popes have decided to reunite on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. They embarked on a U.S. tour in early 2006 with the band Bayside. Several older, pre-1999 songs in the band's repertoire Josh retired from their set list, owing to their expression of views incongruent with his Christianity. During this time, the Popes have acquired a new drummer, Ryan Chavez, who replaced Kellenburger, who had prior commitments. Chavez now seems to be the permanent replacement. During August 5th of Lollapalooza 2006 in Chicago, Josh introduced and played two new songs which he announced would be on the forthcoming Popes album, though no release date or album title was given. The new songs, entitled \"If You Don't Care\" and \"Stay Down\", are now available to hear on the band's MySpace page.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "North Ave and Damen Ave, Chicago, IL", "Artist": "Slow Mass ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8990675.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.9104738, -87.67749599999999], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Post-hardcore, Indie Rock", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "North and Damen", "moreBioInfo": "Debut album \"On Watch\", out now via Landland.

The band has released 2 demos and 3 albums, and a 4th full-length is ready to be released. History: 1995 Infinity was formed by Balgradon, Draconis and Nebiros. After several line-up changes, gigs and the first demo \"Corvus Corax\" ('98) Draconis and Nebiros left the band because of personal reasons. 2001 In the winter of 2001 Balgradon recorded 4 songs in his \"Vortex Studio\" (Zevenhuizen, the Netherlands). After the recordings Quasar joined Infinity as guitarist and in a few months time they wrote several songs for the first full-length album. 2003 \"Nostalgia for the Dark Age\" was released through Spectral Arts Productions. Andras joined Infinity as second guitarist. 2004 \"The Birth of Death\" was released through Total Holocaust Records. 2005 \"Enter thy Labyrinth of Hell\" was released through Total Holocaust Records. 2006 Quasar left Infinity. Balgradon and Andras started writing new material. 2007 Infinity performed some live gigs together with RSDX and PZ of Weltbrand. Balgradon and Andras composed & recorded the 4th album together. Draconis joined Infinity again and will be the second guitarist for the coming live gigs. 2) It all started when Birgitte Moe (24 years old in 2000) was going to audition for an other Norweigan danceband Devotion. Then she heard that Kjell Gabriel Henriksen needed a singer for his band, after a lot of hard work she finally convinced him to let her try singing. The band was at the time named Barbie-Q and consisted of three rappers and a vocalist. When Birgitte joined the group they changed their name into Infinity. Their first album Www.Happy-Poeple.net was somewhat quite succesful. It went straight to #1 just after release selling more than 30.000 copies in Norway. The following album was planned to be Www.Sporty-People.net, the corresponding website had even been created ! But for some reasons, it had never been released (apart from one single called Boys And Girls or 1-2-3-4). Instead there was an album entitled Naked In The Rain, still featuring the voice of Brigitte, the same happy euro style as the previous one. The two singles from this album were covers of the old D.A.D. hit Sleeping My Day Away (also covered by Me & My) and Naked In The Rain. 3) Other band with name Infinity is from Czech.They play eurodance, trance electronic. Their biggest hits are Let me go and Never more. You can listen it on internet radio- Danceradio 4) One more Infinity is melodic death metal band from Krapina, Croatia. \"Infinity\" was also the tracking handle of an early-90s demoscene musician, member of the group \"TCB,\" who composed at least some of his/her tracks in the little-used PC module composer \"Whacker Tracker.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1 S Prospect Ave, Park Ridge, IL 60068", "Artist": "Kysia Live ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11402164.jpeg", "Coordinates": [42.0108517, -87.8292225], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "R&b, Motown, Neo Soul, Soul", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Pazzi Di Pizza", "moreBioInfo": "Motown's Blue-Eyed Soul Child now in Chicago and captivating ears everywhere", "otherInfo": "Special live performance by Matt Kysia paired with Park Ridge's best Authentic Italian.

HuDost\u2019s core musicians are Moksha Sommer, from Montr\u00e9al, and Jemal Wade Hines from Kentucky. Having toured the U.S., Canada, and Europe constantly since April 2006, HuDost has grown and expanded, travelled rocky and glorious terrain and marveled at all they can learn and explore. Moksha and Jemal Wade in this time have grown as artists, as seekers, as a couple and as a family. Since 2015 they have also been highly engaged activists, doing advocacy work as KY Congressional District Representatives for ONE (a non-profit organization working to end extreme poverty and, specifically, the sexism of poverty). HuDost\u2019s last album 'of Water + Mercy' received rave reviews and as an independent release reached #24 in the BILLBOARD SALES CHARTS for Folk/Americana also winning the 2020 Independent Music Award for Social Action Song. In the last year they also received two of the 'Best of Nashville 2020\u2019 awards. On past albums HuDost has worked with GRAMMY Award-winning producer Malcolm Burn (Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris, Peter Gabriel) and GRAMMY Award-winning mixers Oz Fritz (Tom Waits, Bill Laswell, Primus) and Vance Powell (Jack White, Chris Stapleton, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, Buddy Guy, Beyonce, Beck, Alicia Keys, Melissa Etheridge, Kings of Leon). In November, 2021 HuDost will be releasing a new album, \u2018Anthems of Home\u2019 that defines real, honest love and is a lush, breathtaking original collection of compositions that ask important questions. In this time of loss and awakening HuDost\u2019s new album gives powerful voice to this journey in a way that will remain timeless and will prove the resilience that we all share. Special guests on the album include Jars of Clay, The Accidentals, Christie Len\u00e9e and others. Their early release from the new album, \u2018Our Words Will Be Louder\u2019, included additional music video cameos from Kevin Clash (Elmo), Kevin Hearn (from the Barenaked Ladies), Cy Curning (from The FIXX), GangstaGrass, Alana Bridgewater, Nawal, Hymn for Her, Jai Uttal, and more. HuDost worked with minister/activist William J. Barber II and all proceeds from it went to the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. It received press coverage in over 130 major news publications and radio including CTV News, The Observer, Roots Music Canada, All Access Music, and received the \u2018Best Music Video of the Week\u2019 from Blues and Roots Radio. HuDost functions as a duo or as a band, including guest musicians of varying sensibilities and backgrounds, and often including dance in their shows. As a duo their instrumentation includes vocals, harmonium (Indian Pump-Organ), NORD Keys, guitars, Dulcinet, percussion, and a slew of sonic ambient effects. Their music is a rich, eclectic blending of pop and rock with traditional Sufi music, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian and Balkan folk music, Farsi, Turkish, Arabic, and folk. Their sound crosses all borders and barriers, taking the listener on a journey they will never forget. Highlight performances include Bonnaroo, Resident band at FloydFest, BhaktiFest, World Caf\u00e9 Live, Blissfest, The ARK, Alex Grey\u2019s CoSM, the Salvador Dali Museum, Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival, headlining The Islands Folk Fest (Vancouver), WMNF\u2019s Tropical Heat Wave Festival, The Levitt Pavilions, WoodSongs at the Kentucky Theater (on PBS), Nashville\u2019s Bluebird Caf\u00e9, Music City Roots, Tim Robbins\u2019 WTF?!

HuDost's music is a powerful expression of life's journey and discovery. In 2008, Moksha went through a painful process of brain surgery due to a tumor. The healing from this included re-learning language skills, losing and regaining proper sight, and experiencing seizures. This could have been staggering but instead served as learning that has fueled a potent desire to bring healing through sound. In 2013 their amazing son, Kaleb, was brought into the world. It is through music that the losses and gains, pains and triumphs, and excruciating beauty of life can be given a voice of empathy to the synonymous lives of all people. Both critics and fans have said time and time again that the music of HuDost is this very expression. HuDost\u2019s message comes from real experience, real emotion, and real concern for the world - from the birth of a child, to the healing of the body, to the healing of the planet, their words and music echo the human experience.", "otherInfo": "HuDost will be performing an outdoor house concert in Chicago on July 23rd. \nTickets are very limited.

In 1993 she released her first single \"If You Believe\" from her debut album ...Here We Go, but the single flopped and peaked at #75 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. RCA records decided to give the album a second chance and then released \"Betcha'll Never Find\". The single became an R&B and dance hit, when it reached the Top 20 on both Billboard's R&B chart, and Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play. The single was also a minor pop hit. Savage followed that single with the double-A sided \"Don't Let It Go To Your Head/Give It To Ya\", which did worse than her first one, by reaching only #80 on the R&B chart. However, \"Don't Let It Go To Your Head\" found success on the dance chart, where it peaked at No.14 with the help of its house remixes. In 1995 she teamed up with Aaliyah, En Vogue, BlackGirl, Mary J. Blige, Vanessa Williams, SWV, and others for the single \"Freedom\" from the movie Panther. The single hit #18 on Billboard. Savage took two years off before she returned in 1996 with \"I Will Survive\" from her second album I Will Survive (Doin' It My Way). The lead single became a moderate smash in the U.S., where it reached #5 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart, but also #6 in Japan and #12 in the UK. The single was also certified Gold by the RIAA for US single sales of over 500,000 units. RCA records didn't release a follow up single, though the album hit #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. In 1997 she, along with Deborah Cox, Heavy D, and Brownstone performed Janet Jackson's #1 single \"That's the Way Love Goes\" at the Soul Train Music Awards tribute to the popular icon.

Its sales were poor, despite critical acclaim and MTV and BET exposure of its first single \"Come Around\" which peaked at #62. Savage wrote all the lyrics and played piano and drums.

Formed in 1991, Puddle of Mudd has sold over seven million albums and has had a string of number-one singles, including the hits \u201cBlurry,\u201d \"She Hates Me,\" and \"Famous.\" The new album, Welcome to Galvania, was produced by Cameron Webb (Alkaline Trio, Disturbed, Motorhead). It also marks the band\u2019s first full-length album since Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love and Hate in 2009. \u201cThis album has been a long time coming. I\u2019m just so happy to finally get it out there for my fans,\u201d says Puddle of Mudd\u2019s frontman, Wes Scantlin. \u201cI hope the new music inspires my fans to live their lives. I\u2019m just trying to crawl under people\u2019s skin and help them through their life musically.\u201d Scantlin has provided Puddle of Mudd with lead vocals and rhythm guitar since the band\u2019s inception. The origins of the band\u2019s name came from the Missouri River flooding, damaging their rehearsal space. Puddle of Mudd released their first major album, Come Clean, on August 28, 2001, which spawned the singles \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cBlurry.\u201d These hits propelled Puddle of Mudd to reach the No. 5 slot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This success led to the band venturing out on a full-scale European and American tour, hitting the road with Linkin Park, Stone Temple Pilots, and Staind. Come Clean reached triple platinum status in January of 2003. The subsequent album, Life on Display, was released in 2003 and reached gold status. They went on to release Famous in 2007. In 2009, they released Vol. 4: Songs in the Key of Love and Hate. In 2011, the band released an album of cover songs, entitled Re:(disc)overed. Now, Puddle of Mudd is ready to return to the rock scene with their sixth studio album, Welcome to Galvania. Inking a deal with Pavement Entertainment, their new material is primed to reach longtime and new fans. \u201cSometimes in life you come across people who want to bring you down and rip apart your soul. Well, those days are gone,\u201d says Scantlin. \u201cI have surrounded myself with a great team of people. They believe in me and I believe in them. I\u2019d like to thank each and every one of them for their hard work and perseverance. I\u2019d also like to thank all of my fans for their patience. This is just the beginning.

As a singer, songwriter, and pianist, Dina focuses on pop and country-pop where her warm vocals and playfully evocative lyrics entertain listeners and audiences alike.

The album\u2019s closing track, \u201cSummertime,\u201d was featured in Chicago Music Magazine\u2019s local pulse for hot new music and Dina was invited to Chicago\u2019s WGN Radio where she was interviewed by Mike Stephen and performed four original songs in the famous Michigan Avenue studio. In late 2016, Dina started a songwriting challenge that requires her to write and release an original song every week for one year. She seeks inspiration and ideas from fans on social media and at shows, writes fresh lyrics, and records a video for weekly release on, \u201cMusic Monday.\u201d In addition to fostering creativity, this challenge provides her with an opportunity to connect with fans. The response was so positive that Dina extended the challenge beyond the one year mark and started a Patreon (www.patreon.com/dinabachmusic) campaign to offer her fans the chance to support her music.

Claiming influences as diverse as Otis Redding\u2019s classic soul and Jellyfish\u2019s cult power pop recordings, Nielsen has thus far released two albums \u2013 his debut in 2009 as a solo artist, and then his sophomore album in 2012 as Miles Nielsen and the Rusted Hearts \u2013 to critical acclaim and an ever-growing fanbase. The Rusted Hearts\u2019 hot streak will continue this year with their upcoming third LP, Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal blends the country-esque drawl and growling guitars of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with the subtly sensual undercurrent of Ray Charles. Vocal harmonies present throughout the album recall Fleetwood Mac as strongly as they bring to mind the very first doo wop groups. But despite The Rusted Hearts\u2019 readily apparent influences, the result of these combined roots is a singular sound that readily distinguishes the band from its peers. Throughout Heavy Metal, The Rusted Hearts combine their sonic forebears into a style that\u2019s entirely theirs, resulting in songs that boast layers upon layers of complexity under their irresistible surfaces. Underneath the gorgeous guitar lines and vocal harmonies outlining this album, brilliantly intertwined riffs and melodies empower The Rusted Hearts with a supremely resonant emotive force. Nielsen employs his songwriting genius to weave in instruments beyond the traditional rock band setup at exactly the right moments, fading these additional flavors in and out of focus exactly when his songs\u2019 emotional development demands this. With this seasoned veteran at their helm, The Rusted Hearts\u2019 seamlessly marry country, soul, pop, and rock, resulting in ten songs that appeal to just about everyone keeping an open ear. Although Nielsen leads The Rusted Hearts, Heavy Metal isn\u2019t just his journey. The album is credited to a band rather than just Nielsen for a reason: his intent in giving a name to this group was to make sure its members understand how deeply he values their guidance in his spiritual and musical explorations. These friends comprise the same clique that Nielsen has continued to record and tour with for years, a lineup that\u2019s survived the treacherous changes that recent years have brought to his personal life. Since his 2009 debut, The Rusted Hearts have stuck right by his side, and he continues to return to the favor by continuing to expand his musical endeavors into a grander, more layered sound fitting for a full band to work with. Recent years have seen The Rusted Hearts sharing stages with similar artists including Dr. Dog and Rhett Miller to extensive fanfare and acclaim. The Hearts\u2019 time on the road allowed the band members\u2019 interpersonal chemistry to blossom, driving them to reimagine Nielsen\u2019s past solo songs as vivid, full band anthems. This kind of transformation can be attributed to Nielsen being raised in a household that appreciated the classic rock band setup \u2013 yes, this is the same Nielsen blood that runs throughout Cheap Trick lead guitarist and main songwriter Rick Nielsen\u2019s veins \u2013 but it\u2019s more strongly a result of his extensive background in classical voice and recording engineering, two vital musical areas he has degrees in. Heavy Metal\u2019s aching, heartfelt vocals and pristine, lucid production attest to Nielsen\u2019s extensive skills in these areas, but more importantly, they remind listeners that they\u2019re listening to a truly talented musician and songwriter. http://www.milesnielsen.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2801 167th St, Hazel Crest, IL 60429", "Artist": "Marqueal Jordan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6065712.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.5862433, -87.6849443], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz, R&b, Smooth Jazz, R&b/soul, Rnb-soul", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "w/ The Isley Brothers", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago-based artist, and Los Angeles native, Marqueal Jordan is the rare musician who is blessed with the gift of being equally proficient as an instrumentalist and a vocalist.

Colton began his career of tickling the ivories after begging his parents for piano lessons for a few years in his childhood. Ready to dedicate time to music and not sports, unlike some of his classmates, he learned to teach himself after learning the basics over from a piano teacher for about a year. B: Brayden is a 15-year-old high school student enjoying his high school experience and aspiring to become an engineer. Brayden has been brought up in the band life as he watched his father play in town with his band for years. Brayden learned his epic drum skills from his father and even got a taste of the spotlight at the ripe age of 7 when his dad pulled him up on stage to play with him. M: Michal is an 18-year-old high school graduated who excelled in athletics as a star basketball player and superstar quarterback ready to solidify a scholarship. Michael brings a unique and wide ranged voice to the band as the front man and connector of the crew. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Michael met Colton at a local coffee shop outside of church one day and knew Brayden through their high school band class. As Florida began to open their restaurants and bars, the group came together, collaborated, and started playing music together as much as humanly possible. Instantaneously, the group knew they had a special connection as they delighted local patrons in town. Each gig that the band group, they were asked to return and were even hired for private parties and events. As the band began playing, they complete their setlist with covers from numerous decades ranging from The Eagles to Ed Sheeran to Luke Combes and Old Dominion. With time strictly dedicated to writing their own hits, the band has been in the studio throughout Summer 2021 to record abundant originals.

In 2014, the band released the EP \u201cVeva, Hold On!\u201d featuring songs like \u201cBob\u2019s Yer Uncle,\u201d \u201cTreat Yourself\u201d and \u201cSinglehandedly\u201d that drew the attention of regional, national, and international critics and radio stations. The band was featured on WGN, WXRT, Fearless Radio and WIUW, and received great feedback from respected music tastemakers. The band\u2019s growing fan base responded by filling top concert venues that year, including Chicago\u2019s venerable Metro. The Bishop\u2019s Daredevil Stunt Club draws from diverse influences of contemporary music. Song arrangements are the product of technique, style and innovation with great attention to detail in the areas of tone, rhythm, harmony and song structure. The band\u2019s instrumentation is largely guitar-based but includes a wide range of other instruments, such as keys, trumpet, synth, harmonica, percussion instruments and even occasionally a theremin or ukulele, to craft unique sounds, moods and tones. The resulting musical arrangements are an orchestrated backdrop for intricate and often stylistic vocal phrasings suited for lyrics that may take a variety of forms: introspective, narrative and even humorous at times. The band\u2019s members are individually talented, each with rich experience in the Chicago music scene. William Giricz's strong vocal character and range add a distinct style to the band\u2019s music. The multi-instrumental William leads the band\u2019s creative process, sings lead vocals and plays lead guitar on most songs. Dan Passarelli contributes the low end with bass lines that drive progressions and sometimes lend a melodic counterpoint. The multi-instrumental Paulette Bertrand contributes guitar and keys to arrangements and sings lead vocals on a number of songs, adding her own unique dimension to the band\u2019s sound. Darin \"Cappy\" Gregg, who plays guitar and trumpet, brings creativity and energy to the band\u2019s stage performances. Matt Greenawalt contributes on drums drawing from an eclectic musical background.", "otherInfo": "The Bishops Daredevil Stunt Club \u2022 Drew Neely & the Heroes at BrauerHouse Lombard"}, {"Address": "1000 N Rohlwing Rd, Lombard, IL 60148", "Artist": "White Pony - Deftones Tribute ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11512965.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.90749, -88.0360527], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Metal Tribute Night @ Brauer House", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago's very own tribute band to Deftones recreating the ultimate live experience.", "otherInfo": "Front Bar\n\nWhite Pony (Deftones)\n11th Hour (Lamb of God)\nDenial (Sevendust)\nZero Signal (Fear Factory)\n\n9pm - $12 - Discount with Puddle of Mudd ticket"}, {"Address": "27843 W Grass Lake Rd, Antioch, IL 60002", "Artist": "Starlight City Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11245208.jpeg", "Coordinates": [42.4265615, -88.15856529999999], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Boy Bands, R&b, Rock, Pop, Hip Hop, Dance Pop, Girl Power", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Blarney Island", "moreBioInfo": "Formed by ex-members of some of Chicago\u2019s biggest names, this band brings a high energy show to every city they play!

The soundtrack was released in all digital formats in 2010 and over a million copies were sold worldwide.     Raised on the southside of Chicago and growing up on the local blues circuit, he has played with many blues legends learning his craft, toured nationally with  both James Cotton in the 70\u2019s and internationally with Sugar Blue in the 80\u2019s and again in 2013. He recorded multiple albums with keyboardist Brian Culbertson and in 2001 released his first solo effort Passion. In 2006 he released more of his high flying guitar work on his second solo record Face To The Sun. These releases were followed by the sessions for a 3rd and 4th editions of the Halo game soundtracks. His next solo release in 2014 was I Am I Am, a personal project helping support great ape sanctuaries around the world, which included actual vocalizations of apes. When Sugar Blue came calling in 2016 Harry answered and recorded Voyage and toured with Sugar to support the record. In 2020 he released All I Need a guitar exploration of blues based songs taken to new places on the back of some incendiary guitar work.    From humble Chicago beginnings to sharing the stage with Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Johnny Winter, Elvin Bishop, Dickey Betts, Jeff Healey, Buddy Miles, Pinetop Perkins and Bob Geldof while playing in Belgium, France, Holland, Italy, Spain, Swizterland, Ecuador and throughout North America. He has reached a worldwide audience playing at famous Jazz festivals including Montreux, Madrid, North Sea Hague, Montreal Jazz & Blues and the Chicago Blues Festival.    Harry has done commercial recording sessions for multiple TV, cable and radio networks for major companies like McDonalds, Bayer, Kraft, Coors, Turtle Wax, Procter & Gamble, Oprah, James Corden and the Chicago White Sox, even playing the national anthem before a Chicago White Sox game.    Harry has taken his blues-based beginnings and forged a style and identity of his own. An expert technician of the guitar his solos reach into the song and then take off into the stratosphere with a flourish of intricate, lyrical, watery notes cascading in and around the theme of the song. In covering the songs of other artists, he fully imprints his style and makes that song his very own.    His upcoming fifth all acoustic guitar solo release, The h Is Silent, is a collection of originals and cover songs by the likes of Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Willie Dixon, The Beatles, Van Morrison and Dickey Betts and Harry places his own indelible blues rock fusion stamp on each track. It will be released to the public late spring of 2021.", "otherInfo": "Power Trio Rockin\u2019 Blues"}, {"Address": "5157 Main St, Downers Grove, IL 60515", "Artist": "28DAYS ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6168117.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.7930354, -88.0098162], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ballydoyle Irish Pub & Restaurant", "moreBioInfo": "28 Days are a seminal Australian punk rock band formed in Frankston, Australia during 1997. At their career peak, they had a #1 album (Upstyledown) on the Australian ARIAnet Albums Chart and also a #12 single (\"Rip It Up\") on the ARIAnet Singles Chart. The current members as of 2007 are Jay Dunne (vocals), Simon Hepburn aka 'Hep' (guitar), Damian Gardiner (bass) and Adrian Griffin (drums). Original drummer Adam was replaced by Scott Murray in 2000. Tragically, on 18 November 2001, Murray was killed in a hit-and-run accident in the Melbourne suburb of Kew. Vinnie Jukic then briefly filled in the drum role until Adrian Griffin joined. For the album Extremist Makeover, the drums were laid down by Matt Bray. Musically, the band doesn't fit into any single category. Over time, 28 Days' punk rock style has incorporated elements of punk-pop, metal, and (especially) hip-hop after the addition of DJ Jedi Master Jay in 2000. The band's success during the early 2000's could largely be attributed to the popularity of similar rock-rap fusion bands of the time, such as Limp Bizkit. Furthermore, their one-off collaboration with Apollo Four Forty, the 2001 single \"Say What?\", has even seen them dabble in electronica. After debuting with a one-sided 7\" single \"Ball Of Hate\" and the Sand CD single, 28 Days released their self-titled album in 1998 through the independent Stubble imprint. A year later they were picked up by Festival Mushroom's newly launched development label Sputnik, releasing the Kid Indestructible EP. The EP consolidated a following around Australia as a result of Triple J's constant rotation of the tracks \"Kool\" and \"La Tune\". With the introduction of Jay Howard (aka DJ Jedi Master Jay) on turntables and samples, the more harder-edged, rap-influenced singles of 2000, \"Here We Go/Sucker\" and \"Rip It Up\", boosted 28 Days' audience. The latter peaked at #12 on the ARIAnet Singles Chart, and the former featured in some editions of the soundtrack to Mission: Impossible II. When released later that June, their second album Upstyledown entered the ARIAnet album chart at #1, and would go gold. The year was rounded out with two further charting singles - the more reflective \"Goodbye\" and \"Song For Jasmine\", written for Simon Hepburn's young daughter. 28 Days' first home video When Dickheads Snap came out in 2001, featuring tour shots, and behind-the-scenes footage. The only other material to come out that year was the Apollo Four Forty collaboration, \"Say What?\", which charted in the ARIA Top 30. The rest of the year involved more touring and preparation for a new album, until the death of Scott Murray briefly halted their progress. With new drummer Vinnie Jukic, third album Stealing Chairs saw 28 Days into 2002, with its most popular single being the summery \"What's The Deal?\". Stealing Chairs charted in the ARIA Top 10 for a short period, but didn't capitalise on the success brought by Upstyledown. The band received some negative publicity in February 2003 after members descended upon a gig by satirical Sydney-based band The Drugs at Melbourne's Duke of Windsor Hotel late that month. 28 Days allegedly caused an estimated $4500 in damage to The Drugs' equipment, which included beer being poured over a laptop computer and amplifier, and The Drugs' hired van having three of its tyres slashed. Fans of 28 Days at the show were also believed to have graffitied The Drugs' merchandise stand and the venue's chalkboard. The motive for the attack was in regards to an open letter The Drugs' lead singer Ian Baddley posted on his band's website, accusing Jay Dunne of being homophobic and misogynistic at 28 Days' 2003 Big Day Out appearances. Following another quiet period, they released a new single \"Like I Do\" to little fanfare in 2004. It would be a taster for the band's fourth album Extremist Makeover. The album could only manage to scrape into the Top 40, whilst two further singles also charted poorly. Due to this slump in popularity, 28 Days left Festival Mushroom in November 2004, amid much controversy. It was suggested by many that they were dropped, but Damian Gardiner insisted on the band's official message board it was 28 Days' decision alone to leave the label. Their latest EP Bring 'Em Back was released on March 6 2006 on their own Rebel Scum label (through Sony/BMG); a new DVD When Dickheads Snap 3 was then sold at later 28 Days shows. Following the release of a best-of album, 10 Years Of Cheap Fame, 28 Days will tour for the last time in 2007. After a series of mishaps and a continued slump in popularity, DJ Jedi Master Jay left the band - a catalyst that led to their breakup. 28 Days will play the tour as the original 4 piece band they were when they began, and then officially disband.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1000 N Rohlwing Rd, Lombard, IL 60148", "Artist": "11th Hour: Lamb Of God Tribute Chicago ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11512955.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.90749, -88.0360527], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Metal Tribute Night @ Brauer House", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago's one and only Lamb of God Tribute", "otherInfo": "Front Bar\n\nWhite Pony (Deftones)\n11th Hour (Lamb of God)\nDenial (Sevendust)\nZero Signal (Fear Factory)\n\n9pm - $12 - Discount with Puddle of Mudd ticket"}, {"Address": "1245 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60202", "Artist": "Buffalo Nichols ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9979978.jpeg", "Coordinates": [42.0408672, -87.68011369999999], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Blues-rock, Folk, Blues Revival, Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Space", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Buffalo Nichols at SPACE in Evanston, IL // LOWER CAP SHOW // Select the table closest to your party size or choose general admission seats."}, {"Address": "3111 N Western Ave, Chicago, IL 60618", "Artist": "Bitchin Bajas ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.9380949, -87.6876582], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Constellation", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4659 N Clark St, Chicago, IL 60640", "Artist": "Trace Hamilton ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.96692609999999, -87.66684], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Carol's Pub", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "21+ / www.carolschicago.comTrace Hamilton is a seasoned singer/songwriter from Chicago, IL who needs nothing more than a stage and a cold drink to show a crowd a good time.

From his hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi to stages around the world, the now 22-year-old has already headlined two national tours and performed with friends including Vampire Weekend, Jason Isbell and Buddy Guy (with whom he appeared on Austin City Limits). He was interviewed by Sir Elton John on his Apple Music podcast, Rocket Hour, and recently released a duet with Bootsy Collins. In January 2021, Ingram was simultaneously on the covers of both Guitar World and DownBeat magazines, and graced the cover of Living Blues in late 2020. Rolling Stone declared, \u201cKingfish is one of the most exciting young guitarists in years, with a sound that encompasses B.B. King, Jimi Hendrix and Prince.\u201d In the two years since Kingfish was released, there have been major events that have altered his life both personally and professionally. \u201cThere has been much change, happiness and despair in my life,\u201d Ingram says of his last two years. Right as his career was taking off, he lost his mother and biggest champion, the late Princess Pride Ingram. Christone toured for 13 months non-stop, until the pandemic halted live performances and forced him to take stock. As he was thinking about the man he was becoming and the new directions his life was taking, he began writing songs for his next album, 662. The number 662 is the telephone area code for Ingram\u2019s northern Mississippi home, and it first came into use the same year he was born\u20141999. \u201cThe world was introduced to me with Kingfish,\u201d Ingram says of his chart-topping debut. \u201cNow with 662, I want the world to hear and meet a different, more personal side of me.\u201d The album\u2014recorded in Nashville and co-written and produced (as was Kingfish) by Grammy-winner Tom Hambridge\u2014features 13 songs displaying many sides of Ingram\u2019s dynamic personality, as well as his one-of-a-kind guitar and vocal skills. According to Ingram, \u201c662 is a direct reflection of my growth as a musician, a songwriter, a bandleader, and as a young man. This album was written during the pandemic, shortly after I returned home from a whirlwind year and a half of touring and promoting Kingfish. It was an incredible time of change and growth, moments both good and bad, and I am a better and stronger person for it.\u201d 662 is the next chapter in the still-unfolding story of Christone \u201cKingfish\u201d Ingram. He describes 662 as his own personal journey, a story that sits upon the legacy of his influential blues elders. The songs\u2014reflecting his life in and away from his home in the Delta\u2014speak to universal truths, as well as to similar experiences shared by his large and growing multi-generational, multi-cultural fan base. From the blistering, hometown title track, 662, to the irresistible She Calls Me Kingfish to the slow, soulful and poignant Another Life Goes By to the funky truth-telling Too Young To Remember, 662 overflows with hard-hitting songs, jaw-dropping guitar work and deep, soul-possessed vocals. NPR Music says Ingram\u2019s playing is \u201castounding\u2026it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s singing through the guitar.\u201d Ingram\u2019s journey began in the 662 in the city of Clarksdale, in Coahoma County, Mississippi, just ten miles from the legendary crossroads of Highways 61 and 49. Born to a musical family, he fell in love with music as a small child, initially playing drums and then bass. At a young age, he got his first guitar and quickly soaked up music from Robert Johnson to Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, from B.B. King to Muddy Waters, from Jimi Hendrix to Prince, but all the while developing his own sound and style. He progressed quickly, making his stage debut a few months later at Clarksdale\u2019s famous Ground Zero Blues Club, playing behind one of his mentors, Mississippi blues icon Bill \u201cHowl-N-Madd\u201d Perry. Perry gifted the young musician with a new stage name, \u201cKingfish.\u201d He performed at the White House for Michelle Obama in 2014 as part of a delegation of student musicians from the Delta Blues Museum. By age 16 he was turning heads and winning awards, including the 2015 Rising Star Award, presented by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation. uoIngram\u2019s appeal beyond blues was immediate. Even before he cut his debut album and while still a teenager, many of Ingram\u2019s YouTube performance videos garnered millions of views. He performed two songs in Season Two of the Netflix show Luke Cage after the series\u2019 lead producer saw one of his videos. Both songs appear on the official soundtrack album, which introduced him to a young audience, many of whom had never heard Ingram\u2019s brand of blues before. As part of Luke Cage promotion, Ingram performed in an NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert with rap legend Rakim, who also appeared in Luke Cage, and, in 2020, Ingram hosted his own Tiny Desk (Home) Concert. Upon its release, Kingfish debuted on the Billboard Blues Chart in the #1 position, and remained on the chart for an astonishing 91 weeks. In addition to receiving a Grammy Award nomination, it was declared the #1 Best Blues Album Of 2019 by tastemaker UK music magazine MOJO. NPR Music included Kingfish in their list of Best Debut Albums. Outlets including The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Guitar World, The Washington Post and many others shared the joy of their musical discovery with their audience. Radio stations around the world played his music at all hours. In 2019, Ingram\u2019s first single, Fresh Out (featuring Buddy Guy) was the most played song on Sirius/XM\u2019s highly regarded Bluesville channel. Kingfish was also #1 on the Living Blues Radio Chart\u2019s Top 50 Albums Of The Year. In 2020, Ingram won five Blues Music Awards, including Album Of The Year, Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year, Best Emerging Artist Album, Contemporary Blues Male Artist Of The Year and the coveted Best Guitarist award. He also won four Living Blues Awards, including Album Of The Year and Artist Of The Year. In February 2021, Ingram guest hosted Spotify\u2019s popular In The Name Of The Blues playlist, which featured the young bluesman as a seasoned blues fan, talking about and listening to some of his favorite songs. No Depression calls Ingram, \u201ca young bluesman with an ancient soul and a large presence in the here-and-now.\u201d Ingram has twice headlined his own national tours (\u201cFish Grease\u201d and \u201cFish Grease 2\u201d), performing multiple times at clubs, concert halls and festivals across the U.S. and Canada, including show-stopping performances at the Chicago Blues Festival, the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, the Bonita Blues Festival in Florida, The Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise, at sold out shows from New York\u2019s Brooklyn Bowl to Austin\u2019s Antone\u2019s to San Francisco\u2019s famed Biscuits & Blues to Los Angeles\u2019 legendary Troubadour and El Rey Theatre. He\u2019s performed in Europe repeatedly, including appearances at the Moulin Blues Festival in the Netherlands and the Blues Heaven Festival in Denmark. During the time between Kingfish and 662, Ingram recorded and released three stand-alone singles. In February 2020, he unleashed his incendiary studio and live interpretations of legendary bluesman Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks\u2019 Empty Promises. In July 2020, he released his emotionally riveting original song, Rock & Roll, a deeply loving tribute to his mother, Princess Pride Ingram (included as a bonus track on the 662 CD). And in November 2020, he gifted his fans with his first Christmas song, the instant holiday classic, Ghost From Christmas Past. With his eye-popping guitar playing and his reach-out-and-grab-you-by-the-collar vocals, Ingram performs every song with unmatched passion and precision. While his new songs tell personal stories, they also tell of shared human experiences. With 662, he creates contemporary blues music that speaks to his generation and beyond, delivering the full healing power of the blues. And he can\u2019t wait to bring that power on stage. As he recently told DownBeat magazine, \u201cYou need that crowd to connect. You need that crowd to be there so you can tell their story to them. Somewhere, somebody has the blues.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3159 N Southport Ave, Chicago, IL 60657", "Artist": "Duffle Bag Buru ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.9396389, -87.66341159999999], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Schubas", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "226 S Bridge St, Yorkville, IL 60560", "Artist": "Angela Perley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11261731.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.6414444, -88.4466534], "Date": "2021-07-23", "EventDate": "Jul. 23rd, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative Country, Americana, Alternative Country-rock, Indie Pop, Alt-country, Rock & Roll", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Katy Guillen w/Angela Perley at The Law Office Pub & Music Hall", "moreBioInfo": "\"Angela Perley has been gigging nonstop with her band The Howlin' Moons since they released their debut album in 2014, laying down an interesting mix of folk, Americana, and \u201960s-tinged psychedelic rock that floats seamlessly between Bob Dylan and Procol Harum, sometimes within the same song.\"\u2014 No Depression All of this has led up to Perley\u2019s forthcoming LP, '4:30' (released Aug. 2, 2019), her first solo effort which she co-produced with longtime guitarist and collaborator, Chris Connor.

Leaving behind a 15-year long career of production experience in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became fascinated with the sounds of Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence with the soul of house music. Then came \u2018Okay,\u2019 the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014.

Before long Derrick became a strong presence in Chicago\u00b4s underground dance scene. \"When I got my driver\u00b4s license at 16 my sneak ability was validated,\" he laughs. \"I was a fierce bedroom jock for a long time. After you mix for the love of it for six or seven years, you get it pretty tight and you can take it on the road.\" Derrick got by working at dance\u2013music specialty stores like Gramaphone and gigging at parties. later Derrick landed regular DJ stints at Shelter, Foxy\u00b4s, and Smart Bar. Though he doesn\u00b4t spin much locally anymore, when he does he attracts large crowds. Derrick\u00b4s sets are rooted in house, but he freely travels outside club tastes, seamlessly incorporating old\u2013school disco, soul, jazz, and whatever else catches his fancy. Most of the time Derrick works in Europe, where he\u00b4s become a major celebrity among dance\u2013music aficionados. And the money\u00b4s a hell of a lot better there. \"It\u00b4s hard not to laugh on the occasions when you\u00b4ll make 20 times what you make in Chicago on a Saturday night, but here are also times when you do it just for the fun, like at home. So many people come up to me and say, \u00b4Man, I had the worst day. My girlfriend left me, I locked my keys in my car, but you turned me for two hours, and that made me able to get up in the morning.\u00b4 That\u00b4s the best thing going.\" In 1988 Derrick, fellow DJ Mark Farina, and friend Chris Nazuka released an EP as the group Symbols & Instruments. The record had a strong influence on the burgeoning ambient techno movement in England. While it wasn\u00b4t a commercial success, it established Derrick as an international figure in the dance\u2013music underground. Since then he\u00b4s been involved with a number of recording projects, firstly his solo project Sound Patrol under whom he released his first album \u00b4Sweetened \u2013No Lemon\u00b4 which exuded a soulfulness and low\u2013key grittiness that resonated beyond the infectious grooves and made a departure from the machine\u2013like quality of the dance music fare of the time. Since then the pioneering, innovative tracks and consequent critical acclaim have marked Derrick out as one of the most important players in dance music. Most notably through his more recent releases on Classic. His first release was as Rednail with \u00b4I Think of You\u00b4, followed by N? Pschidt and Hope under his own name. N? Pschidt combined woven scatting with sleepy minimal beats on \u00b4Dreaming Again\u00b4 and skilfully cast his own low, sexy drawl over his trademark Carter grooves to form \u00b4Boompty Boomp Theme\u00b4, described by Seven magazine as \u00b4without doubt the slinkiest and downright funkiest track I\u00b4ve heard for a long time.\u00b4 Derrick\u00b4s latest Classic release \u00b4Hope\u00b4 is again causing a storm amongst DJs and press alike and his Classic album is eagerly awaited and expected for release sometime within the next year.

Although he enjoyed those experiences and landed additional acting roles during his teen and college years, RJ soon realized that his singing voice was the reason he was selected for many of these roles and decided to shift his focus on improving as a vocalist. Inspired by the likes of Michael Jackson, James Brown, Luther Vandross and Jamie Foxx, RJ\u2019s passion for singing earned him a collegiate choir scholarship at Saint Joseph\u2019s College (IN).

Sleeping Bag Studios reviewed the EP and had this to say after listening, \u201cGriffith has found all kinds of ways to win through the innovative approach he takes to his material \u2013 I dig it!\u201d The fourth song off of the EP, \u201cHaunted By My Past,\u201d was also selected to be in the independent film The Assumptions, which premiered on February 27, 2017 in Palm Springs, CA., and in 2019 the production team of the motion picture Canal Street, creatively collaborated with RJ on his music video for the third song off of the EP titled \u201cGod Bless Our Enemies.\u201d With the success of Prey, RJ didn\u2019t keep his fans waiting long, dropping a three song Valentine\u2019s Day EP titled Direction four months later. Direction was well-received, and soon after the release his voice caught the attention of National Recording Gospel Group Zion\u2019s Joy. In August of 2017 it became official, RJ joined Zion\u2019s Joy as a lead tenor and toured with the group across the country while continuing to pursue his solo career; tour stops included Nashville, New Orleans, Dallas, Jacksonville and Indianapolis, highlighted by being selected to open for Deitrick Haddon and Jekalyn Carr at the East Coast Gospel Summit in Baltimore. RJ also made his national television debut with the group on July 14, 2018 during a performance of their most recent single \u201cWhat Would Heaven Look Like\u201d on the Mike Huckabee show. With a full slate of performing with Zion\u2019s Joy, his church and solo gigs while also running his Positive Vibes Only event for Chicagoland youth, RJ took a short break from creating new music, but has recently been spending a lot of time in the studio working on his new EP, A Good Day. The planned release of the full EP is fall of 2019, but he unveiled the first single, the title track, \u201cGood Day,\u201d on January 12, 2018. \u201cGood Day\u201d has since been put into radio rotation on Rejoice 102.3 Chicago, 106.3 Chicago\u2019s R&B and was featured on ABC 7 News Chicago.

He was playing guitar, then drums and bass, by the time he was 12. Ed and Pookie received lessons and support from their famous uncle. \u201cJ.B. taught me everything I know,\u201d says Ed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without him.\u201d Ed and Pookie spent their teen years making music together, and in 1975 formed the first incarnation of The Blues Imperials. They played their first gig at a West Side club called Big Duke\u2019s Blue Flame, splitting the $6 take four ways. Over the next few years, the group played every club in the neighborhood. Even so, they still needed day jobs to pay the bills. Ed worked ten hours a day as a buffer at the Red Carpet Car Wash. Pookie drove a school bus. Night after night they played their roaring brand of blues in tiny clubs, and eventually the word reached Alligator president Bruce Iglauer. At the time, Iglauer was looking for local talent for The New Bluebloods, an anthology of some of Chicago\u2019s younger blues musicians. \u201cEd and his band had a good reputation,\u201d recalls Iglauer. \u201cI had only seen them live once or twice. I knew Ed was a hot slide player, but I had no idea what he and the band were really capable of. I just knew that their music reminded me of Hound Dog Taylor and J.B. Hutto, two of my favorite musicians. It seemed like having a band this rough and ready would be a nice change of pace for the anthology, so I asked them to come down to the studio and cut a couple of songs. I never expected what happened.\u201d The band\u2014never having been in a recording studio before\u2014treated the studio like a club, playing live to Iglauer, the engineer, and all the people on the other side of the control room glass. After Ed recorded his two rehearsed songs quickly, there was still plenty of studio time left, so they just kept playing. After 10 songs were in the can, Iglauer offered the band a full album contract. The end result of the session was 30 songs cut in three hours with no overdubs and only one second take. Twelve of those songs became the band\u2019s debut album, Roughhousin\u2019, released in September of 1986. The national press reacted with amazement to the blues world\u2019s new discovery. Feature stories ran in Spin, Musician, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune and dozens of other publications. The Village Voice declared, \u201cRoughhousin\u2019 just may be the blues album of the year.\u201d The New York Times raved, \u201cRaw-boned, old-fashioned Chicago blues has a new young master\u2014Lil\u2019 Ed Williams.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until 1987, when guitarist Mike Garrett joined the band, and a year later, when Garrett recruited his Detroit hometown friend Kelly Littleton to play drums, that things really began to take off. Garrett\u2019s risk-taking rhythm guitar work and Littleton\u2019s unpredictable, old school drumming were the perfect complement to Lil\u2019 Ed\u2019s and Pookie\u2019s rambunctious playing. With their 1989 album Chicken, Gravy & Biscuits, doors opened and audiences poured in. Through relentless touring, the group crystallized, becoming tighter with each performance, more adept in their abilities to read each other\u2019s musical moves. Their spontaneous and unpredictable live show became legendary among blues fans worldwide. They have played the Chicago Blues Festival multiple times, and have appeared at The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Portland\u2019s Waterfront Blues Festival, The Tampa Bay Blues Festival, The San Diego Blues Festival, The Pennsylvania Blues Festival and dozens of other festivals around the country. Satisfying worldwide demand, they have performed at festivals in Canada, Great Britain, France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Japan, Australia, India, Turkey and Panama. Lil\u2019 Ed & The Blues Imperials released eight Alligator albums between 1986 and 2012. With each one, the band\u2019s national and international stature grew as their fan base\u2014known internationally as \u201cEd Heads\u201d\u2014continued to expand. With 2006\u2019s Rattleshake, Ed and company reached a whole new audience. Die-hard \u201cEd Head\u201d Conan O\u2019Brien brought the band before millions of television viewers on two separate occasions. Success and accolades never stop pouring in. Living Blues called 2012\u2019s Jump Start \u201cscorching and soulful\u201d with \u201ccrafty, clever lyrics...joyous and stomping.\u201d The group took home the Living Blues Award for Best Live Performer in 2011, 2012 and 2013. They won the prestigious Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year in both 2007 and 2009. The Associated Press says, \u201cWilliams fills Chicago\u2019s biggest shoes with more life and heat than anyone on stage today.\u201d With The Big Sound Of Lil\u2019 Ed & The Blues Imperials, the band continues to bring their blistering Chicago blues to \u201cEd Heads\u201d new and old. Their infectious energy, joyful showmanship and masterful playing have been honed to a razor\u2019s edge by their many years together. Lil\u2019 Ed, Pookie, Mike and Kelly have seen sports stars and presidents, musical fads and fashion trends come and go. Meanwhile, their fiery music has more than stood the test of time. \u201cWe\u2019re not band members,\u201d says Williams, \u201cwe\u2019re family, and families stay together.\u201d Night after night, gig after riotous gig, the musical family called Lil\u2019 Ed & The Blues Imperials bring their big, dynamic Chicago blues sound to fans across the country and around the world.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "320 E Kenilworth Ave, Villa Park, IL 60181", "Artist": "Istvan & His Imaginary Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11289994.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.8866167, -87.9699014], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:30 AM", "Venue": "Cortesi Veterans Memorial Park", "moreBioInfo": "Istvan is a children's musician whose cool cleverly crafted music appeals to kids and adults alike.

The kid honing his craft on hand-me-down tables now shares (or steals, depending on your perspective) the stage with Hip Hop legends (Lupe Fiasco, Afrika Bambaataa, Wu-Tang Clan, ?Love), EDM greats (Amon Tobin, Kid Koala, Nero, The Prodigy) and three time world DMC champion DJ Qbert, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. He holds down quite a few residencies in Chicago, including the world famous Smart Bar, rips up stages at huge music festivals (Lollapalooza, North Coast Music Fest, SXSW) and works everything from charitable events to openings to fashion shows for clients like: Adidas, Red Bull, Scion, AT&T and Microsoft. WNUR and the DJZTRIP.com community both voted DJ Intel \u2018Best MixTape DJ.\u2019 The New York Post and Entertainment Weekly both love him. The people at his Face Melt parties love him. When DJ Intel gets to work you never quite know what to expect, but one thing\u2019s for sure-- you\u2019re going to love it too.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "6615 Roosevelt Rd, Berwyn, IL 60402", "Artist": "Katy Guillen ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.86483459999999, -87.7896676], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Fitzgerald's", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Katy Guillen and The Drive is an indie soul rock band from Kansas City, MO.PATIO OPENS AT 12PMMAKE A RESERVATION (CLICK HERE)FITZGERALDS Patio is free s always room for our more spontaneous friends as well."}, {"Address": "1410 S Museum Campus Dr, Chicago, IL 60605", "Artist": "DJ Mochi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11138146.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.8633663, -87.61678669999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Chicago Fire Pre-Kickoff Party", "moreBioInfo": "DJ Mochi is a Chicago-based DJ, producer, and event curator.

One is located in Chicago, IL, originally from Michigan; another is a band that formed in Boston in the 80's; the third was a 5 piece pop-punk band from Raynham, MA that was active circa 2000-2003. The Drive (that formed in the 80's) was a rock band consisting of Pat Dreier, Jamie Walker, Tony Paolino, and Paul Kochanski. Pat Dreier, Jamie Walker and Paul Kochanski created The Drive from their previous band The Lines (which also included Eric Hafner and Rick Weden). The Drive's two biggest hits were Doin' the Countdown and Let the Rain Come Down. However, Patrick Dreier and Tony Paolino had to leave the band because \"domestic responsibilities\". Later Dreier and Paolino joined again creating the band PT73. The Drive (Acoustic Rock), Chicago, IL / Michigan The Drive is a get-up-and-go Acoustic Rock Trio that strives to push the envelope in ways acoustic music rarely does. Their performances deliver high-energy entertainment to fans of all genres. In the winter of 2000, at a small renovated schoolhouse on the outskirts of Grand Rapids, Michigan, acoustic guitarist Bryan Southerton approached brother and drummer Brad Southerton with a handful of song ideas he had been working on. The two began writing music, and approached friend and lyricist Mario Casa de Calvo with the works in progress. Collectively, the ideas were then molded into songs and developed with no intentions of ever going public. \"Back then, it was more about writing music just to do it. There were no plans or ideas for how far it would go,\" said Bryan. A three song demo tape of the collaboration was recorded on a 4-track in the groups\u2019 garage. Copies were passed around between friends under the name \"The Drive,\" a name that reflected a musician\u2019s determination toward writing music without knowing when to give up, regardless of its acceptance. Soon enough, they were approached to perform at house parties and as an opening act for other more established bands. After consistent positive feedback from a growing fan base, the decision was made to start taking the small project more seriously. In 2001, Mario moved to Lubbock, Texas in pursuit of a Masters Degree in Psychology at Texas Tech, but that didn\u2019t stop Bryan and Brad\u2019s ambitious vision of what The Drive could accomplish. For an entire year, songs were written between Michigan and Texas by sending tapes back and forth through the mail. With a now limited window of time on their hands for working directly with Mario, The Drive was banking on only one to two weeks a year for reaching recording and performance deadlines. During these small windows of opportunity, the group recorded their first LP entitled \"Immediate Seating,\" and performed numerous small shows in Bryan and Brad\u2019s hometown of Manistee, Michigan. In 2003, the brothers were attending college at Ferris State University to complete their Bachelors degrees in Music Industry Management. Often, you could find them cutting class to write and rehearse in a cramped storage closet at the campus Music Center. As time went on, the inability to find a suitable bassist after six auditions compiled with Mario\u2019s growing unavailability forced plans for the future of the Drive to slowly diminish. \"It was a hard time for us. Bryan and I were both becoming uninspired without Mario around. We were hitting so many dead ends that progress with The Drive basically stopped,\" noted Brad. Months went by with the Southerton brothers auditioning for local solo artists, in hopes of starting a new project. After one of the auditions, they started playing some of The Drive\u2019s music for the girl they had just auditioned for. She immediately encouraged the two to start pursuing the music again, saying that \u201cit was too good to give up on.\u201d The enthusiasm from her inspired Brad and Bryan to start again with the mindset of doing whatever it took to continue the project. The coming of 2004 brought a new beginning for The Drive as Bryan and Brad decided to take matters into their own hands. With Mario out of the picture, a large void needed to be filled. With no prior singing experience, Bryan immediately joined the FSU Choir and started taking private vocal lessons. Brad started writing down every fleeting thought and poetic inspiration that entered his head, collecting hundreds of scribbled-on cocktail napkins, receipts, and composition books with lyrical ideas. Together, they filled the gap as vocalist and lyricist. At the same time, a budding friendship with fellow Music Industry Management student Randy Ray brought the dedicated bassist to The Drive that they had been looking for. The group worked together relentlessly through the winter months, and for the first time ever during the spring of 2004, The Drive was ready to take their music on the road. In just one year\u2019s time, by the spring of 2005, The Drive had performed over sixty shows, held a largely increasing number of loyal fans, and recorded and released a new EP entitled \"Wrapped in Blue.\" On top of being full-time students and maintaining part-time jobs, they also put together a marketing team that met weekly, entitled \"Team Drive,\" which consisted of fellow Music Industry Management students. In their diminishing free time, they also developed and sold a multitude of merchandise, established a professional quality website, and had plans for the future in the works. What began as a \"just-for-fun\" music venture had quickly become a household name on Michigan\u2019s independent music scene. Later that year, with the release of their second LP, \"Live Music,\" the band began to receive positive feedback from critics as well fans. In reference to the release, Music Review Magazine said, \"The sound is excellent, and ranges from dark, brooding ballads, to driving, upbeat sing-along anthems.\" Bryan and Brad\u2019s hometown newspaper hailed their success in full-page feature entitled, \"Local band takes the fast lane to stardom.\" In 2006, after all three members were out of college, they relocated to Grand Rapids. There, Brad and Randy rented a large downtown apartment that contained two rooms of open storage space in the back. That spring, they converted the storage space into a two-room office, and proposed an internship program for students pursuing degrees in Music Industry Management at Ferris State University. The program was approved and three students were recruited to intern during the summer semester for \"The Office,\" a marketing and management group exclusively representing The Drive. For the entire summer, members of The Drive worked mornings at their part-time jobs, and then five to eight hours with interns at The Office. Nights were spent in rehearsal for two to four hours at a time. By the end of the week, they were on the road, averaging two to three performances a weekend. \"2006 was the busiest we\u2019ve ever been. It felt like we were biting off more than we could chew on a daily basis, but in the end all the hard work paid off. Getting a show used to mean us begging a venue if we could open for a certain headlining act. Now, the venues are calling us to headline and letting us pick the bands we want on the bill. Recently, we were flown out to Las Vegas for three shows as a headliner downtown at the Freemont Street Experience. \"Our performance payment has changed too. A few years back, we were happy to make enough money to get our van fixed when it would break down on our way home. Now, we\u2019re making enough cash for more merchandise, recording time, better equipment, and other ventures. \"I would say though, by far, our biggest thrill now is our fans. I\u2019ve been asked for autographs from people with ages ranging from eight to fifty-eight. We even know one fan that has a tattoo of The Drive\u2019s logo. Now that\u2019s a compliment.\" said Brad.", "otherInfo": "Katy Guillen and The Drive is an indie soul rock band from Kansas City, MO.PATIO OPENS AT 12PMMAKE A RESERVATION (CLICK HERE)FITZGERALDS Patio is free s always room for our more spontaneous friends as well."}, {"Address": "1354 W Wabansia Ave, Chicago, IL 60642", "Artist": "21 ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.9138993, -87.66260109999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "The Hideout", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Feels great to be back! \nJoin us for an Evening of Nu Disco, Vocal house & Club Classics."}, {"Address": "Elmhurst, IL", "Artist": "The Jukebox Heroes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11188904.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.8994744, -87.9403418], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Cover Band", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "Private Patio Party", "moreBioInfo": "The Jukebox Heroes' are an acoustic based cover band that can come in many forms and facets.

The band formed in 1992 with the name Shrinky Dinx, later changing it to Sugar Ray after the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. Their debut album, Lemonade and Brownies, was released in 1995, though it failed to produce a major hit. Their early work was strongly influenced by funk metal, punk, alternative rock and straight up R&B, not a particularly fashionable combination at the time. Sugar Ray's first mainstream hit came in the summer of 1997 with their song \"Fly\", which was released on the album Floored and featured notable reggae artist Super Cat. \"Fly\" was notable for not sounding anything at all like the rest of the tracks on the album and received frequent (some called it \"constant\") radio play. As a result of the success of \"Fly\", Floored sold extremely well and was certified double platinum. However, by the end of 1997, critics skeptical that Sugar Ray could put out another successful song labeled them a one-hit wonder. Their 1999 album 14:59 was the sardonic reply to these accusations, with the title implying that their fifteen minutes of fame were not quite up\u2014their \"fame clock\" reading 14:59. \"Every Morning\", which received widespread comparisons to \"Fly\", rose to similar success in late 1998. Their follow-up single \"Someday\" received extensive airplay during 1999 as well. This album, which outsold its predecessor and was certified triple platinum, proved that Sugar Ray was not a one-hit wonder after all. Sugar Ray was also set to play at Woodstock '99, but had to cancel due to illness. Their 2001 self-titled album Sugar Ray produced another hit with \"When It's Over\" and reached the same level as their previous singles. Sugar Ray's 2003 effort In the Pursuit of Leisure, and the first single from that album, \"Mr. Bartender (It's So Easy)\" received a lukewarm reception. In 2005, Sugar Ray released a greatest hits album, with two new songs, including the single \"Shot of Laughter\".", "otherInfo": "***ALL 3 DAYS***\nMODERN MIDWAYS CARNIVAL\nGREAT LIVE MUSIC\nRESTAURANT ROW\nBEER & LIQUOR GARDEN\nNEW AND IMPROVED MERCHANT VENDORS & CRAFTS\n------------------------------------------------------\nRidgeFest 2021's Entertainment Line-up\nFriday - July 23rd ($10) The Allman Betts Band\nSaturday - July 24th ($10) Sugar Ray\nSunday - July 25th ($5 / Free for Residents with valid ID) Queen Nation\nAMAZING FIREWORK SHOW SUNDAY JULY 25TH"}, {"Address": "410 S Michigan Ave Suite 908, Chicago, IL 60605", "Artist": "Susan Merdinger, Pianist ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11473836.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.8764761, -87.6247088], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Music with a View presents Sheridan Solisti", "moreBioInfo": "\"A genuinely honest virtuoso...\" Audiophile Audition \"Ethereal and atmospheric performance\" American Record Guide \"Excellent Pianist\" Robert Sherman, The New York Times \"World-Class Pianist\" Highland Park News/Sun-Times Media \"Courageous Debut\" Truly amazing...

While widely known for their original songs, the group is also revered for clever versions of the most popular cover music, spanning everything from vintage Tom Petty, Paul Simon and Talking Heads to contemporary roots revivalists Chris Stapleton, Dawes and Mumford & Sons. From humble beginnings at dive bars and late-night house parties, the band has since been featured on many of the most revered stages in Chicagoland, including House of Blues, Metro, Bub City, Fitzgerald\u2019s, Cubby Bear and Joe\u2019s on Weed. The band has also become a fixture at summer fests throughout the region, with appearances at Taste of Randolph, Taste of Lincoln Avenue, Retro on Roscoe, Oktoberfest Chicago, Lakeview Taco Fest, and many more. Fletcher Rockwell\u2019s latest release, Help Me Get Better, finds the band conjuring the soulful spirit of a bygone era, when classic anthems like \u2018\u2019American Girl\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Born to Run\u2019\u2019 ruled radio airwaves across the nation with big hooks, sparkling harmonies and stellar musicianship.

The album\u2019s soaring debut single, \u201cjoy,\u201d which features a 100-person choir and a hypnotic wave of rhythm and electronic sounds, hit No. 1 and has been streamed more than 12 million times. The lyrics cut through the cacophony of societal noise to remind us about what is important: \u201cOh, hear my prayer tonight. \u2018Cause this is do or die. The time has come to make a choice. I choose joy.\u201d The inspiring pop masterpiece also represents the exciting adventure into unchartered territory for brothers Joel and Luke Smallbone, who were propelled into superstardom with the release of their critically acclaimed sophomore album, RUN WILD. LIVE FREE. LOVE STRONG., which debuted at No. 1 on iTunes and was certified gold. In addition to winning two GRAMMYs and four Dove Awards, the duo performed internationally on a hugely successful 60-date arena tour. They have garnered four No. 1s (\u201cjoy,\u201d \u201cPriceless,\u201d \u201cFix My Eyes,\u201d and \u201cShoulders\u201d), nine Top 10 hits, and had songs featured on the Emmys, Super Bowl, Sunday Night Football and many other high-profile events, including performances on The Tonight Show, Today and Jimmy Kimmel Live! But as they reveal in Burn the Ships, there is no looking back, no resting on their laurels. There is much more to explore and explain, especially during this time of great unrest when answers don\u2019t seem immediately apparent. With a new level of vulnerability and honesty, they wrote every song on this project, which they also co-produced with longtime collaborators Aqualung, Tedd T. and Seth Mosely. \u201cIt isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 far from it \u2013 but there is a sense of truthfulness and a heart and a personality and an ideology behind this record,\u201d Joel says. \u201cIt feels like the most mature version of for KING & COUNTRY.\u201d The title track was inspired by a 1500s Spanish explorer who boldly landed his ships on enemy shores without any knowledge of what awaited his arrival. To ensure that the men were committed to their mission, he proclaimed, \u201cBurn the ships!\u201d The only way to go was onward; retreat was not an option. \u201cThat is the big statement that this collection of songs is making,\u201d says Luke. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live in the past; we want to move forward. There are things in everybody\u2019s pasts that you have to get rid of\u2014in some cases physically burn and in other cases you just need to get rid of them however you can emotionally. For us, that is the name that represents this collection of art and work best.\u201d These songs fit in perfectly with today\u2019s pop music arena, where artists ranging from Kesha to Drake are exploring themes of religion, prayer and God. The Smallbones\u2019 words are a soothing salve for a hurting nation in need of healing. \u201cPeople are hungry for truth and hope,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they want something that is false. So when it comes to people seeking out God, they are receptive because they are trying to figure out what is true and real. I think that is a good thing. I hope our music can play a role in that, but ultimately people have to figure it out for themselves.\u201d Burn the Ships may be the duo\u2019s most personal work to date because the songs are about some of the most meaningful and terrifying moments of their lives. For instance, \u201cNeed You More\u201d was inspired by the near-death of Luke\u2019s infant son, Leo. His wife Courtney found Leo in his crib, blue from not breathing. She began CPR while praying over their son, who soon came back to life. While driving to the hospital, the words, \u201cI need you more/more than ever before,\u201d came to Luke, who hit record on his phone. That original recording, including sounds from the car, was included in the final mix. \u201cMy hope is that if I have gone through some form of suffering, maybe there is someone else who has gone through something similar who can take a bit of hope that there was someone else just like them,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI feel like God has given me these struggles to share those stories.\u201d \u201cjoy.\u201d was inspired by Luke\u2019s late-night marathon scrolling through social media. \u201cI couldn\u2019t articulate in that moment why I was sad, but it sent me on a pilgrimage, and that is where \u2018joy\u2019 came from.\u201d I realized I needed to do something if I want to have joy. I can\u2019t just scroll and find it.\u201d While \u201cFight On, Fighter\u201d continues the duo\u2019s focus on a woman\u2019s worth, it is first and foremost a musical letter of support to their wives. Joel and Luke, who have become American citizens, learned about hope, love and support from their tight-knit family. Their parents raised seven children in Sydney, Australia, before moving to Nashville in 1991. Music became the family business. Their charismatic father was a music promoter and sister Rebecca St. James became a successful Christian music artist, so the duo\u2019s teen years were spent working as part of her road crew. When Luke was 19 and Joel was 21, they formed a band and began writing and recording the body of work that would become for KING & COUNTRY. They released their debut album, Crave, in 2012 and won New Artist of the Year at the 2013 Dove Awards, where they received six nominations. In what has become a full-circle moment, they wrote \u201cNever Give Up\u201d with sister Rebecca for the new album. Once novices, they are now their sister\u2019s peers and have a shared understanding of the difficulties of being frequently away from home. \u201cWe learned the craft of music and fell in love with it on the road with Rebecca, \u201c Joel says. \u201cIn some ways, for KING & COUNTRY is a legacy band of Rebecca\u2019s. It\u2019s a real special moment to be able to have that creative collaboration after all of these years with her.\u201d The album\u2019s theme of adventure and exploration ends poetically with \u201cPioneers,\u201d a lush song about the romance and realities of long-term commitment. Fittingly, wives Moriah and Courtney join them on the final track. \u201cIn a time where commitment can be hard to come by\u2014the through-thick-and-thin/death-do-us-part kind of commitment\u2014it\u2019s a song that celebrates that kind of love,\u201d Joel says. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that the duo felt compelled to embark on this musical pilgrimage because they have been two of our most prescient storytellers in recent years, addressing issues even before they became part of the national conversation. It\u2019s as if they know what we need to hear exactly when we need to hear it. For instance, their 2016 No. 1 hit \u201cPriceless\u201d, which also inspired the Smallbones\u2019 human-trafficking themed movie by the same name, celebrates a woman\u2019s worth. Several years before the #MeToo phenomenon, the Smallbones sparked a movement highlighting a woman\u2019s value that continues to grow and evolve today. They began writing and recording songs about hope and love several years ago for Burn The Ships, messages that are vital during these tumultuous times. Their music provides answers, comfort and affirmation, while offering a constant reminder that we aren\u2019t alone, even in our darkest times. \u201cWe never want to be a voice of critique or criticism, but a voice of, \u2018Maybe if we shifted our perspective, what would we see?\u2019 That is the beauty of music,\u201d Joel says. \u201cWe ask the questions of ourselves: \u2018I want to have joy. I want to find a way. When I am faced with despair, struggle or hardship, what can I do?\u2019\u201d Luke adds, \u201d The thing I am most proud of with this album is that when I look at all 10 songs, they all have a special place in my heart and there is a real significant story with each one. This album is about those songs in our hearts being exposed to others, and hopefully others will expose their hearts too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2548 N Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60614", "Artist": "Vance Kelly ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.9287213, -87.6492076], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Chicago Blues, Blues", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Kingston Mines", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "World famous Kingston Mines features the best Blues music from 2 bands on 2 stages.

They have recorded dozens of Top 40 hits (including four US #1 singles), many best-selling albums, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. The original group comprised singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group. The Beach Boys officially broke up in 1998 shortly after Carl Wilson's death, however Mike Love and Bruce Johnston maintain the rights to the name and continue to tour with their own band as The Beach Boys. ===History=== ==Early years== The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine. The early inspirations of the group were the Wilsons' musician father, Murry, and the close vocal harmonies of groups such as The Four Freshmen. The group performed initially as The Pendletones, after the Pendleton woolen shirts popular then. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the sole actual surfer in the group. He suggested to his brothers that they do some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in Southern California. At first Murry Wilson, by many accounts a hard-driving man, steered The Beach Boys' career, engineering their signing with Capitol Records in 1962. In 1964 Brian Wilson fired his father after a violent confrontation in the studio. Over the next few years they became increasingly estranged; when Murry died some years later, Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral. The Beach Boys' early material focused on the California youth lifestyle (e.g., \"All Summer Long\", \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"), cars (\"Little Deuce Coupe\") and of course surfing (\"Surfin' U.S.A.,\" \"Surfin' Safari,\" and many others). Although their music was bright and accessible, these early works contained remarkably sophisticated musical ideas. During this period, Brian Wilson rapidly progressed to become a melodist, arranger, and producer of world-renowned stature. Their early hits made them major pop stars in America and other countries, although their status as America's top pop group was challenged in 1964 by the emergence of The Beatles, who became The Beach Boys' major creative rival. Like the Beatles, the Beach Boys showed very fast development during the mid-'60s, drawing upon the innovations of songwriters and producers such as Burt Bacharach and especially Phil Spector. They produced the enduring classic \"California Girls\" in 1965, a banner year for popular music which also saw similarly advanced singles by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Byrds, and James Brown. But it was the Beach Boys' role to create a myth of American freedom and dreams of adolescence, and increasingly, to articulate a dread of what lay after adolescence. ==Brian's innovations and personal difficulties== During 1964 Brian Wilson began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and withdrew from touring to concentrate on song writing and record production. Glen Campbell served as Wilson's replacement on tours, until his own career success required him to leave the group. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road, and then contributing his talents in the studio. Wilson's growing mastery of the recording studio and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements reached an early peak with the acclaimed LP Pet Sounds (1966). Classic singles from that album, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows\" showed Wilson's growing skill as a composer, arranger and producer. \"God Only Knows\" is said to have been the first pop single ever released in the U.S. to have the word \"God\" in the title (because of which many radio stations in the U.S. refused to play it.) \"Caroline, No,\" also taken from Pet Sounds, was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time Brian was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years. The album's meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew) set a new standard for popular music. It remains one of the more evocative releases of the decade, with a distinctive strain of melancholy and nostalgia for youth. The album is still widely regarded as a classic and Paul McCartney has named it one of his favorite albums of all time, (with \"God Only Knows\" as his favorite song) often saying that it was a major influence on the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Despite the critical praise it received, the album was poorly promoted by Capitol Records and failed to become the major hit Brian had hoped it would be (only reaching #10). Its failure to gain wide recognition hurt him deeply. Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, partly because he feared the band would lose its audience if they changed their successful formula, and partly because he personally disliked the new material, which he famously criticized as \"Brian's ego music.\" At Love's insistence, Brian changed the title of one song from \"Hang on to Your Ego\" to \"I Know There's an Answer.\" Another likely factor in Love's antipathy to Pet Sounds was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist Tony Asher rather than with Love, even though Love had co-written the lyrics for many of their earlier songs and was the lead vocalist on most of their early hits. It should also be stated that Love, as recently as February 2008 in a top British music magazine, denies emphatically that he was opposed to Brian's new directions. Quite the contrary, contributing the lyrics to the classic form of Good Vibrations which certainly seemed to usher in flower power. He really is tired of this view of him as being Brian's nemesis. He could see Brian was destroying himself and that was what he feared. Seeking to expand on the advances made on Pet Sounds, Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed Dumb Angel. Its first fruit was \"Good Vibrations,\" which Brian described as \"a pocket symphony\". The song became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK # 1 single in 1966 \u2014 many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. In 1997 it was named the \"Greatest Single of All Time\" by Mojo music magazine, in 2000, VH1 placed it at number 8 on their \"100 Greatest Rock Songs\" list, and in late 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 6 on their \"500 Best Songs of All Time\" list. It was also one of the more complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded, costing a reported $16,000 -- more than most pop albums of that time -- with sessions stretching over several months in at least three major studios. In contrast to his work on Pet Sounds, Wilson adopted a modular approach to \"Good Vibrations\" \u2014 he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound of each facility. He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, organ, piano, tack piano, two basses, guitars, electro-theremin, harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the \"Good Vibrations\" vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career. Even as his personal life deteriorated, Wilson's musical output remained remarkable. The exact nature of his problems was a topic of much speculation. He abused drugs heavily, gained an enormous amount of weight, suffered long bouts of depression, and became paranoid. Several biographies have suggested that his father may have had bipolar disorder, and after years of suffering, Wilson's own condition was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia. ==The story behind \"Smile\"== Shortly after completing \"Good Vibrations,\" Wilson met session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks, and in late 1966 they began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of superb new songs for the Beach Boys' next album, which was originally going to be titled Dumb Angel but was renamed Smile. Using the same methods as on \"Good Vibrations,\" recording began in late 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of endless speculation, it is apparent that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated the musical themes of the major songs. But some of the other Beach Boys \u2014 especially Love \u2014 found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style; another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to Smile and was particularly critical of Parks' lyrics; he has also since stated that he was becoming deeply concerned about Wilson's escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of \"Cabinessence,\" when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, \"Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield.\" After a heated argument, Parks walked out and his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end. Many factors combined to focus intense pressure on Wilson as Smile neared completion, including mental instability, the pressure to perform against fierce opposition to his new music, the relatively poor response to Pet Sounds, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol. Matters were complicated by his reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and amphetamines, which only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Just weeks before The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, Smile was shelved. Over the next 30 years the legends surrounding Smile grew, until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music. Some of the tracks were salvaged and rerecorded at Brian's new home studio in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the completed versions of \"Good Vibrations\" and \"Heroes and Villains\", on the 1967 LP Smiley Smile, which would prove to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group. Despite the cancellation of Smile, interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks \u2014 including \"Our Prayer\", \"Cabinessence\", \"Cool, Cool Water\", and \"Surf's Up\" \u2014 were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was expecting to complete and release Smile even until 1972, when it became clear that only Brian would ever be able to make sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. A substantial number of original tracks and linking fragments were included on the group's 30th anniversary CD boxed set in 1993. Smile itself, in its original conception, did not surface until Wilson and Parks completed the writing and Brian rerecorded it as a solo project in 2004. ==Mid-career brings changes== Following their peak popularity with the song Good Vibrations was a period of declining commercial success, with Smiley Smile and subsequent albums doing poorly on the US charts (although they fared better in the UK). Their image problems were not helped by the criticism that followed their withdrawal from the bill of the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival as a result of Carl's draft problems, an event that would undoubtedly have been crucial in establishing their new sound had they been able to present their new material there. The 1967 album Wild Honey, regarded by many critics as a classic, features exuberant upbeat songs written by Brian and Mike, including the hit \"Darlin'\", and a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"I Was Made to Love Her\". Friends (1968) is a quiet, tuneful, and largely acoustic album, influenced by the group's adoption of the practice of Transcendental Meditation. The title single, however, backed by Dennis' songwriting debut Little Bird, was their least successful since 1962. This was followed by the single \"Do It Again\", a return to their earlier \"fun in the sun\" style, which was moderately successful in the US, but went to #1 in the UK. As Brian's health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished and he became increasingly withdrawn from the group. To fill the void, the other members of the group began writing songs, and Carl gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol Records before signing with Reprise, they produced one more album, 20/20 (1969), primarily a collection of leftovers (including some from \"Smile\"), cover songs, and several new songs by Dennis. One of Denny's songs, \"Never Learn Not To Love\", featured lyrics by Charles Manson[1] originally titled \"Cease to Exist\". Besides \"Do It Again\", the album included their cover of the Ronettes' \"I Can Hear Music\", their last top 40 hit for seven years. Their first two Reprise LPs were Sunflower (1970) and 1971's Surf's Up, featuring new songs by Brian and all the group members, plus selections from the aborted \"Smile\" project. According to the liner notes for the 2004 version of Smile, Reprise expected the legendary album to be completed and released as part of the new contract, but this was never to be; however, these albums included some of their most evolved and complex music since the \"Smile\" period. The addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in 1972 led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. Carl and the Passions-\"So Tough\" was an uncharacteristic mix including several songs unrecognizable as the Beach Boys. Although it includes the classic \"Marcella\", many consider the album among their poorest efforts. Continuing with Fataar and Chaplin, Holland (1973) was more successful. The album's lead single \"Sail on Sailor,\" a brief return to the collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, was one of the more emblematic of Beach Boys songs. Although it did not produce any top-40 hits, Holland's was popular on free-form FM-radio, and includes several classics including Al Jardine's \"California Saga: California\". In the summer of 1974 Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of the Beach Boys' pre-Pet Sounds hits, entitled Endless Summer. Helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, it caught the mood of the country and surged to #1 on the Billboard album chart, becoming their first gold record since \"Good Vibrations\", and stayed on the album chart for three years. [2] The following year another compilation, Spirit of America, also did well. These sales performances demonstrated that the classic Beach Boys sound was back in fashion. In 1975, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit \"Wishing You Were Here\". Beach Boy voices were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\", but following Holland, the group produced no new music until 1976. ==Brian's return== 15 Big Ones marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. This album includes several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including \"Rock and Roll Music\" (which made #5), \"Blueberry Hill\", and \"In The Still of The Night\". Brian and Mike's \"It's OK\" was a return to their earlier \"fun-in-the-sun\" style, and was a moderate hit. In 1977 the Beach Boys released the LP Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more \"fun\" songs (\"Honkin' Down The Highway\"), a mature love song (\"Let's Put Our Hearts Together\") - a quirky mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Although not a commercial success, the album has since gained the status of a classic within the Beach Boys' oeuvre. Brian's contributions diminished over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. Although he appeared sporadically with them in concert, he contributed little to their performances or recordings. Despite a much-publicised \"Brian's Back\" campaign in the late '70s, most critics believed the group was past their prime. Many expected that Brian would one day become the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties. ==Deaths of Dennis and Carl Wilson== In the late 70s Dennis Wilson also began to suffer increasingly from drug and alcohol abuse, and some of the group's concert appearances were marred when he and other band members showed up onstage drunk or drugged. The band was forced to publicly apologize after a shambolic performance in Sydney in 1979 during which several members of the group appeared to be drunk. In spite of his own frequent drinking, Dennis Wilson managed to release his first solo work, Pacific Ocean Blue, and to launch the now famed work-in-progress Bambu, with friend and musician Carli Mu\u00f1oz. In 1980, the Beach Boys played a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before a vast crowd. This tradition continued for the next two years, but in 1983 Secretary of the Interior James Watt banned the group from playing on the Mall, saying that rock concerts drew \"an undesirable element\". [3] This drew howls of outrage from the many of the Beach Boys' American fans, who stated that the Beach Boys sound was a very desirable part of the American cultural fabric. First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized, and in 1985 the group appeared on the Mall again. The group most recently appeared on the Mall in 2005 for the Fourth of July concert. Dennis Wilson's problems had escalated in the early 1980s, and he accidentally drowned in late 1983 while diving from his boat as he drunkenly tried to recover items he had previously thrown overboard. Despite Dennis's death, The Beach Boys soldiered on, and they enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as the David Lee Roth version of \"California Girls\". In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, covering the song \"Wipe Out\" and filming a video for it. They scored their first #1 in 22 years with the 1988 song \"Kokomo,\" which was featured on the soundtrack of the hit Tom Cruise movie Cocktail and which became their biggest-selling hit ever. In 1996 they guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of Fun, Fun, Fun, which was a British Top 30 hit. Members of the band appeared on sitcoms such as Full House (starring sometimes drummer John Stamos) and Home Improvement in the 1990s, as well as touring occasionally, but their declining career contrasted dramatically with the massive public interest and rabid critical praise that followed Brian's gradual return to touring in the 1990s. The critically acclaimed documentary I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, important in restoring Wilson's reputation, saw him performing for the first time with his now adult daughters, Wendy and Carnie, and included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the '60s, '70s, and '80s. Tragedy struck the Wilson family again in 1998 when Carl Wilson died of lung cancer. Although Love and Johnston continued to tour as The Beach Boys, no other original members accompanied them. Their tours remained popular, even as they came to be viewed primarily as a nostalgia act. Meanwhile, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine each separately pursued solo careers with their new bands. ==Setting aside differences== On June 13, 2006, the major surviving Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks) all set aside their differences and reunited for a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the album Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts to all major members, with Brian Wilson accepting for his late brothers Carl and Dennis. Wilson himself implied there is a chance that all the living members (having not performed together since the late 1980s) will reunite again. ==Personnel changes through the years== From the start, The Beach Boys have undergone many variations in composition, being represented by fill-ins as often as not. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry. Marks rejoined the band in 1997, during Carl Wilson's last illness, and remained with them for two years. Glen Campbell toured for several months with the group in 1965, as a touring replacement for Brian, who had played bass in concert. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member. During the mid-1970s drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin joined the band. Though not official members, The Beach Boys' supporting band has featured many notable musicians over the years. Keyboard player Daryl Dragon, later famous as half of the pop duo Captain & Tennille, toured with the band, along with his future wife Toni Tennille. Carli Mu\u00f1oz, who had been playing percussion with the band since 1970, in 1971 replaced Daryl Dragon as keyboard player until 1981. Jeff Foskett joined the touring band in 1981 as a guitarist and vocalist and remained with the group until 1990, Foskett is currently a member of Brian Wilson's group. Billy Hinsche, of Dino, Desi, & Billy fame, was also a longtime member of the supporting band throughout the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Daryl Dragon's brother Dennis Dragon was a percussionist for the group in the early '70s. Bobby Figueroa was a drummer and percussionist for the Beach Boys in the 1970s and 80s. Mike Meros was a longtime keyboard player for the group, leaving in 2001 to join Alan Jardine's Endless Summer Band (Meros passed away in late 2007). Mike Kowalski was a longtime drummer for the band, starting his Beach Boys tenure in 1969, and continuing with the group throughout the '70s, '80s,' 90s, and '00s, only to leave in 2006. Ed Carter played guitar and bass for the group from 1969 through the late 1990s. Carter joined Al Jardine's Beach Boys Friends and Family in 1999. Some of the changes in The Beach Boys' organization were less formal. They enjoyed a casual collaboration with fellow Southern Californians Jan and Dean. Much to the consternation of other band members, Wilson composed \"Surf City\" and gave the song, without compensation, to Dean Torrence. Jan and Dean, at the time not nearly as popular as The Beach Boys, recorded the song and scored their first number one single, long before the Beach Boys reached the same milestone. Years later, Torrence happened upon the studio where the Beach Boys were recording their \"Beach Boys' Party!\" album. He joined in the singing, and can be heard singing harmony in the \"Barbara Ann\" cut from that album. Despite the deaths of two original Beach Boys, the band continues to this very day, one of the busiest bands on the circuits. Love and Johnston have often hinted at a new Beach Boys studio album, but as of 2008, there have been no new releases, excluding compilations. To the surprise and delight of fans around the world, Wilson has mounted several major tours under his own name with a band containing members of The Wondermints (Darian Sahanaja, Nick Walusko, and Probyn Gregory) and led by former Beach Boys guitarist Jeff Foskett plus other supporting musicians (Scott Bennett, Taylor Mills, Jim Hines, Paul Mertens, Nelson Bragg, Bob Lizik). Their note-perfect live performances of the entire Pet Sounds album earned some of the most glowing concert reviews of Wilson's career, with some commentators calling the shows \"the concert of a lifetime\". In 2003 and 2004, he and Van Dyke Parks reunited to complete the unfinished sections of Smile, and in 2004 Wilson and his band toured the world performing a live concert version of the album. They then recorded a new studio version of Smile using vintage recording equipment and including sessions at the fabled Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, where some of the original recordings were made. In September of 2007, Wilson debuted a new work entitled That Lucky Old Sun, co-written with Van Dyke Parks and band member Scott Bennett, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Wilson plans to record and release That Lucky Old Sun as a studio album in 2008. Jardine toured for a while with the Beach Boys Family & Friends (which for legal reasons quickly became Alan Jardine Family & Friends Beach Band), featuring his sons Matt and Adam, Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, former Beach Boys sidemen Ed Carter , Bobby Figueroa, and Carl's brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, among others. Jardine now tours as the Endless Summer Band which includes his two sons, Hinsche, and several other performers including members of the pop/rock band Tripsitter.

The studs n\u2019 leather bedecked TRANSMETAL, founded during January 1987, have stuck to their Thrash / Speed Metal stance over nearly twenty Spanish language albums. Upon their formation TRANSMETAL was fronted by vocalist Alberto Pimentel, who featured on the 1988 debut \u2018Muerto en la Cruz\u2019, produced by Dark Angel\u2019s Eric Meyer, and the follow up \u2018Desear Un Funeral\u2019. On June 18th 1989 the group opened for Death at the Naucalpan Arena Lopez Mateos. In 1990 Pimentel departed to found LEPROSSY. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez of ILLUSION, and subsequently frontman for Arkhe, would fill the vacancy before Juan Carlos Camarena took the role of second guitarist. The band featured on the high profile \u2018New Titans Over Mexico\u2019 tour of 1991, these shows sharing billing with Sacred Reich in January, Kreator in July and Sepultura in December. On May 3rd 1992 TRANSMETAL supported Overkill at the Arena A. Lopez Mateos in Tlanepantla then appeared as part of the \u2018Mexican Mosh\u2019 festival alongside Sick of It All, Deicide and Nuclear Assault. The album that year, 'Amanecer En El Mausoleu', featured a cover version of 'Killers' by French band Killers. On November 8th the band scored the high profile support to Black Sabbath's concert at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City. 1992 witnessed the departure of these latest two recruits and Alberto Pimental resumed activities with the band on a stand in basis. A successful Mexican tour during October found TRANSMETAL headlining over Mortuary and Inquisidor. The band's status would engender a further slot at the March 1993 \u2018Mexican Mosh\u2019 festival event, this time sharing honours with OVERKILL, KREATOR and Monstrosity among others. The following year TRANSMETAL, together with fellow native acts Angeles del Infierno and Rata Blanca, represented Mexico at the June 1994 \u2018Monstruos De Rock\u2019 gathering in Spain. The group notably guested for Slayer on September 10th at the Mexico City Balneario Olimpico. Pimentel would opt out yet again to forge another version of Leprosy (spelt with one \u2018S\u2019 on this ocassion) assembling a new band including Ramses guitarist Julio Marquez and ex-INQUISIDOR drummer Felipe Chacon. TRANSMETAL took onboard the esteemed former Luzbel and Huizar frontman Arturo Huizar as their lead vocalist but by February 1998 two members of Panic, vocalist Mauricio Torres and guitarist \u2018Eric Towers\u2019 (a.k.a. Ernesto Torres) stabilised the band for the album 'Las Alas Del Emperador'. Meantime, Lorenzo Partida and ex-TRANSMETAL vocalist Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez would create the side project Ultratumba. TRANSMETAL's show at the Adolph Lopez Mateos de Tlalnepantla Arena in Mexico City in July 1999 was filmed and recorded, subsequently put out as two live discs 'dubbed XIII A\u00f1os... En Vivo - Primera Parte' and 'XIII A\u00f1os... En Vivo - Segunda Parte'. TRANSMETAL took a novel approach of recording tracks for two albums at once, 'Tristeza De Lucifer' and 'De Bajo De Los Cielos P\u00farpura', these sessions held in Hammond, Indiana with producer Mike Sheffield. Upon the release of 'Tristeza De Lucifer' the group toured South America during 2001. Shows in Bogota, Colombia, Manizales and Cal\u00ed in Colombia, River basin in Ecuador, Arequipa in Peru, La Paz and Santa Cruz in Bolivia would prove a first for a Mexican Metal band. 'De Bajo De Los Cielos P\u00farpura' then arrived in July 2000, prompting a 30 date run of shows across the USA. That same year the debut album 'Muerto En La Cruz' would see a CD re-issue, adding four extra tracks. The band's legacy would be honoured in 2001 with the delivery of no less than two tribute albums in 'Milicia Infernal... Tributo a Transmetal' and the live 'Milicia Infernal... Tributo A Transmetal (En Vivo)', both released on the Denver label. Those paying homage included LUZBEL, PANIC, Disgorge, Ricter, Allusion, ULTRATUMBA, Domain, IRA, A.N.I.M.A.L., Leprycorn and Mechanical Chaos. TRANSMETAL returned in September 2002 with the experimental 'El Amor Supremo', this album, their very first to incorporate keyboards and recorded at Studio 880 in San Pablo California, seeing production duties going to the Cancer, DEATH, Disincarnate, Testament and Konkhra credited guitarist JAMES MURPHY. The band's December 2003 album, 'Lo Podrido Corona La Inmensidad', saw keyboard contributions coming from Erick Fuentes Quintana and a guest guitar solo on the track 'Creador De La Amargura' from JAMES MURPHY. 2004 saw TRANSMETAL tackling an album, 'Temple De Acero', comprising entirely of cover versions including the Scorpions 'The Zoo', Candlemass' 'At The Gallows End', Celtic Frost's 'Return To The Eve' and 'Dethroned Emperor', Accept's 'Balls To The Wall', AC/DC's 'Back In Black' and 'Let Me Put My Love Into You', Sodom's 'Remember The Fallen', BLACK SABBATH's 'Evil Woman', DEATH's 'Evil Death', Uriah Heep's 'Free And Easy' and Twisted Sister's 'The Kids Are Back'. A notable compilation issued in June that same year, '17 Years Down In Hell', re-worked the tracks from the previous two albums, 'El Amor Supremo' and 'Lo Podrido Corona La Inmensidad', in English language. An unaccredited track, a newly recorded version of 'Aborrecer Al Forence', saw Mauricio Torres on vocals. New studio album 'El Despertar De La Adversidad' arrived in February 2006, capitalised on by a run of Mexican shows, gigs in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and spot US gigs. The band would be back in the recording studio before the end of the year cutting the 'Progresi\u00f3n Neur\u00f3tica' album for November.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3159 N Southport Ave, Chicago, IL 60657", "Artist": "Been Stellar ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10300154.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.9396389, -87.66341159999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Punk, Indie Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Schubas", "moreBioInfo": "Been Stellar is originally from Michigan and recently relocated to NYC: home to some of their biggest influences including The Strokes and Interpol.

Colton began his career of tickling the ivories after begging his parents for piano lessons for a few years in his childhood.

Michael brings a unique and wide ranged voice to the band as the front man and connector of the crew. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Michael met Colton at a local coffee shop outside of church one day and knew Brayden through their high school band class.

Relying heavily on a Fender six-string bass, Brokeback is a minimalist fusion of low-end jazz and a plethora of other influences, ranging from rock to ambient to hip-hop. Field Recordings featured a number of musicians associated with the Chicago ambient circuit, including vocalist Mary Hansen of Stereolab and trumpeter Rob Mazurek and percussionist Chad Taylor of the Chicago Underground Duo.

In preparation for their sophomore album, Morse Code in the Modern Age: Across the Americas, Kupersmith was added to the permanent lineup, making Brokeback a two-bassist duo. The project that started out as a solo endeavor has evolved into a highly collaborative affair.

From his hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi to stages around the world, the now 22-year-old has already headlined two national tours and performed with friends including Vampire Weekend, Jason Isbell and Buddy Guy (with whom he appeared on Austin City Limits). He was interviewed by Sir Elton John on his Apple Music podcast, Rocket Hour, and recently released a duet with Bootsy Collins. In January 2021, Ingram was simultaneously on the covers of both Guitar World and DownBeat magazines, and graced the cover of Living Blues in late 2020. Rolling Stone declared, \u201cKingfish is one of the most exciting young guitarists in years, with a sound that encompasses B.B. King, Jimi Hendrix and Prince.\u201d In the two years since Kingfish was released, there have been major events that have altered his life both personally and professionally. \u201cThere has been much change, happiness and despair in my life,\u201d Ingram says of his last two years. Right as his career was taking off, he lost his mother and biggest champion, the late Princess Pride Ingram. Christone toured for 13 months non-stop, until the pandemic halted live performances and forced him to take stock. As he was thinking about the man he was becoming and the new directions his life was taking, he began writing songs for his next album, 662. The number 662 is the telephone area code for Ingram\u2019s northern Mississippi home, and it first came into use the same year he was born\u20141999. \u201cThe world was introduced to me with Kingfish,\u201d Ingram says of his chart-topping debut. \u201cNow with 662, I want the world to hear and meet a different, more personal side of me.\u201d The album\u2014recorded in Nashville and co-written and produced (as was Kingfish) by Grammy-winner Tom Hambridge\u2014features 13 songs displaying many sides of Ingram\u2019s dynamic personality, as well as his one-of-a-kind guitar and vocal skills. According to Ingram, \u201c662 is a direct reflection of my growth as a musician, a songwriter, a bandleader, and as a young man. This album was written during the pandemic, shortly after I returned home from a whirlwind year and a half of touring and promoting Kingfish. It was an incredible time of change and growth, moments both good and bad, and I am a better and stronger person for it.\u201d 662 is the next chapter in the still-unfolding story of Christone \u201cKingfish\u201d Ingram. He describes 662 as his own personal journey, a story that sits upon the legacy of his influential blues elders. The songs\u2014reflecting his life in and away from his home in the Delta\u2014speak to universal truths, as well as to similar experiences shared by his large and growing multi-generational, multi-cultural fan base. From the blistering, hometown title track, 662, to the irresistible She Calls Me Kingfish to the slow, soulful and poignant Another Life Goes By to the funky truth-telling Too Young To Remember, 662 overflows with hard-hitting songs, jaw-dropping guitar work and deep, soul-possessed vocals. NPR Music says Ingram\u2019s playing is \u201castounding\u2026it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s singing through the guitar.\u201d Ingram\u2019s journey began in the 662 in the city of Clarksdale, in Coahoma County, Mississippi, just ten miles from the legendary crossroads of Highways 61 and 49. Born to a musical family, he fell in love with music as a small child, initially playing drums and then bass. At a young age, he got his first guitar and quickly soaked up music from Robert Johnson to Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, from B.B. King to Muddy Waters, from Jimi Hendrix to Prince, but all the while developing his own sound and style. He progressed quickly, making his stage debut a few months later at Clarksdale\u2019s famous Ground Zero Blues Club, playing behind one of his mentors, Mississippi blues icon Bill \u201cHowl-N-Madd\u201d Perry. Perry gifted the young musician with a new stage name, \u201cKingfish.\u201d He performed at the White House for Michelle Obama in 2014 as part of a delegation of student musicians from the Delta Blues Museum. By age 16 he was turning heads and winning awards, including the 2015 Rising Star Award, presented by The Rhythm & Blues Foundation. uoIngram\u2019s appeal beyond blues was immediate. Even before he cut his debut album and while still a teenager, many of Ingram\u2019s YouTube performance videos garnered millions of views. He performed two songs in Season Two of the Netflix show Luke Cage after the series\u2019 lead producer saw one of his videos. Both songs appear on the official soundtrack album, which introduced him to a young audience, many of whom had never heard Ingram\u2019s brand of blues before. As part of Luke Cage promotion, Ingram performed in an NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert with rap legend Rakim, who also appeared in Luke Cage, and, in 2020, Ingram hosted his own Tiny Desk (Home) Concert. Upon its release, Kingfish debuted on the Billboard Blues Chart in the #1 position, and remained on the chart for an astonishing 91 weeks. In addition to receiving a Grammy Award nomination, it was declared the #1 Best Blues Album Of 2019 by tastemaker UK music magazine MOJO. NPR Music included Kingfish in their list of Best Debut Albums. Outlets including The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Guitar World, The Washington Post and many others shared the joy of their musical discovery with their audience. Radio stations around the world played his music at all hours. In 2019, Ingram\u2019s first single, Fresh Out (featuring Buddy Guy) was the most played song on Sirius/XM\u2019s highly regarded Bluesville channel. Kingfish was also #1 on the Living Blues Radio Chart\u2019s Top 50 Albums Of The Year. In 2020, Ingram won five Blues Music Awards, including Album Of The Year, Contemporary Blues Album Of The Year, Best Emerging Artist Album, Contemporary Blues Male Artist Of The Year and the coveted Best Guitarist award. He also won four Living Blues Awards, including Album Of The Year and Artist Of The Year. In February 2021, Ingram guest hosted Spotify\u2019s popular In The Name Of The Blues playlist, which featured the young bluesman as a seasoned blues fan, talking about and listening to some of his favorite songs. No Depression calls Ingram, \u201ca young bluesman with an ancient soul and a large presence in the here-and-now.\u201d Ingram has twice headlined his own national tours (\u201cFish Grease\u201d and \u201cFish Grease 2\u201d), performing multiple times at clubs, concert halls and festivals across the U.S. and Canada, including show-stopping performances at the Chicago Blues Festival, the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, the Bonita Blues Festival in Florida, The Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise, at sold out shows from New York\u2019s Brooklyn Bowl to Austin\u2019s Antone\u2019s to San Francisco\u2019s famed Biscuits & Blues to Los Angeles\u2019 legendary Troubadour and El Rey Theatre. He\u2019s performed in Europe repeatedly, including appearances at the Moulin Blues Festival in the Netherlands and the Blues Heaven Festival in Denmark. During the time between Kingfish and 662, Ingram recorded and released three stand-alone singles. In February 2020, he unleashed his incendiary studio and live interpretations of legendary bluesman Michael \u201cIron Man\u201d Burks\u2019 Empty Promises. In July 2020, he released his emotionally riveting original song, Rock & Roll, a deeply loving tribute to his mother, Princess Pride Ingram (included as a bonus track on the 662 CD). And in November 2020, he gifted his fans with his first Christmas song, the instant holiday classic, Ghost From Christmas Past. With his eye-popping guitar playing and his reach-out-and-grab-you-by-the-collar vocals, Ingram performs every song with unmatched passion and precision. While his new songs tell personal stories, they also tell of shared human experiences. With 662, he creates contemporary blues music that speaks to his generation and beyond, delivering the full healing power of the blues. And he can\u2019t wait to bring that power on stage. As he recently told DownBeat magazine, \u201cYou need that crowd to connect. You need that crowd to be there so you can tell their story to them.

Eric Bachmann had another musical project he was working on (Crooked Fingers), and the grind of the traditional album cycle and touring started to weigh on the Archers\u2019 desire to continue making music together. After a 13-year hiatus, the band performed a secret show in January 2011 at Cat\u2019s Cradle in Carrboro, NC, with The Love Language. The show proved they hadn\u2019t really missed a beat, and so a larger tour was booked in mostly smaller venues to replicate the raw live experience for which the band had always been highly regarded.

In the studio, as on stage, it seems at first blush that Jon Grusauskas\u2014delivering lyrics that call for your attention and seamlessly moving from guitar to keys to samples\u2014is handling the entire upper end of the spectrum\u2026 until you consider how broad the melodic embrace of rhythmatist Rory Dolan and low end wizard Luke Bemand: injecting splashes of color and wicked chops into their heavy groove foundations or driving assaults, this dynamic battery simultaneously eases and propels lespecial through fractious changes of mood and tempo. The band\u2019s fearless pursuit of a synthesis of the musical idioms that inspire them has, thus far, culminated with the release of their second album, cheen, on October 31, 2017. Pole vaulting over traditional genres, cheen is a snapshot of a band flexing their remarkable creative muscles. In a traditional sense, cheen is a risky album: it asks the listener to suspend a categorical approach and dig into their own eclectic unconsciousness, to adapt a phrase, and appreciate the flow of the record from start to finish, as it moves guided by an unseen plan. If there is an underlying thematic structure, it is one that is anchored\u2014musically and lyrically\u2014by horror flicks, 1980s video games and lespecial\u2019s indictment of the current cultural state of affairs. Not overtly political, angry or morose, cheen seems to observe the zeitgeist and respond to it. lespecial\u2019s willingness to take this risk of presenting an album full of flavors and feels is a reflection of the respect they have for their fans, present and future: they simply don't underestimate the listener, and that itself is refreshing. Never willing to sit back and settle into a groove, lespecial pivoted quickly from touring in support of the release of cheen into a whole new format: collaborating with and supporting the iconic Bay Area hip-hop emcee and producer, Zion I, on tour dates and a forthcoming album. There are also plans to release remixes of cheen tracks from some of their producer friends who hold lespecial in the highest esteem.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1000 N Rohlwing Rd, Lombard, IL 60148", "Artist": "Scotty and the Bad Boys ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11554434.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.90749, -88.0360527], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Chicago Blues", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Brauer House", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Scotty and the Bad Boys are looking forward to doing this full band show!"}, {"Address": "5025 N Clark St, Chicago, IL 60640", "Artist": "DJ Ron ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11551135.jpeg", "Coordinates": [41.9732158, -87.6678122], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Sunday Social with Chamilla Foxx & DJ RONS!", "moreBioInfo": "Ron Slomowicz (RONS) is a Chicago-based DJ/VJ/Journalist with a 25 year-long career.

He was playing guitar, then drums and bass, by the time he was 12. Ed and Pookie received lessons and support from their famous uncle. \u201cJ.B. taught me everything I know,\u201d says Ed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without him.\u201d Ed and Pookie spent their teen years making music together, and in 1975 formed the first incarnation of The Blues Imperials. They played their first gig at a West Side club called Big Duke\u2019s Blue Flame, splitting the $6 take four ways. Over the next few years, the group played every club in the neighborhood. Even so, they still needed day jobs to pay the bills. Ed worked ten hours a day as a buffer at the Red Carpet Car Wash. Pookie drove a school bus. Night after night they played their roaring brand of blues in tiny clubs, and eventually the word reached Alligator president Bruce Iglauer. At the time, Iglauer was looking for local talent for The New Bluebloods, an anthology of some of Chicago\u2019s younger blues musicians. \u201cEd and his band had a good reputation,\u201d recalls Iglauer. \u201cI had only seen them live once or twice. I knew Ed was a hot slide player, but I had no idea what he and the band were really capable of. I just knew that their music reminded me of Hound Dog Taylor and J.B. Hutto, two of my favorite musicians. It seemed like having a band this rough and ready would be a nice change of pace for the anthology, so I asked them to come down to the studio and cut a couple of songs. I never expected what happened.\u201d The band\u2014never having been in a recording studio before\u2014treated the studio like a club, playing live to Iglauer, the engineer, and all the people on the other side of the control room glass. After Ed recorded his two rehearsed songs quickly, there was still plenty of studio time left, so they just kept playing. After 10 songs were in the can, Iglauer offered the band a full album contract. The end result of the session was 30 songs cut in three hours with no overdubs and only one second take. Twelve of those songs became the band\u2019s debut album, Roughhousin\u2019, released in September of 1986. The national press reacted with amazement to the blues world\u2019s new discovery. Feature stories ran in Spin, Musician, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune and dozens of other publications. The Village Voice declared, \u201cRoughhousin\u2019 just may be the blues album of the year.\u201d The New York Times raved, \u201cRaw-boned, old-fashioned Chicago blues has a new young master\u2014Lil\u2019 Ed Williams.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until 1987, when guitarist Mike Garrett joined the band, and a year later, when Garrett recruited his Detroit hometown friend Kelly Littleton to play drums, that things really began to take off. Garrett\u2019s risk-taking rhythm guitar work and Littleton\u2019s unpredictable, old school drumming were the perfect complement to Lil\u2019 Ed\u2019s and Pookie\u2019s rambunctious playing. With their 1989 album Chicken, Gravy & Biscuits, doors opened and audiences poured in. Through relentless touring, the group crystallized, becoming tighter with each performance, more adept in their abilities to read each other\u2019s musical moves. Their spontaneous and unpredictable live show became legendary among blues fans worldwide. They have played the Chicago Blues Festival multiple times, and have appeared at The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Portland\u2019s Waterfront Blues Festival, The Tampa Bay Blues Festival, The San Diego Blues Festival, The Pennsylvania Blues Festival and dozens of other festivals around the country. Satisfying worldwide demand, they have performed at festivals in Canada, Great Britain, France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Japan, Australia, India, Turkey and Panama. Lil\u2019 Ed & The Blues Imperials released eight Alligator albums between 1986 and 2012. With each one, the band\u2019s national and international stature grew as their fan base\u2014known internationally as \u201cEd Heads\u201d\u2014continued to expand. With 2006\u2019s Rattleshake, Ed and company reached a whole new audience. Die-hard \u201cEd Head\u201d Conan O\u2019Brien brought the band before millions of television viewers on two separate occasions. Success and accolades never stop pouring in. Living Blues called 2012\u2019s Jump Start \u201cscorching and soulful\u201d with \u201ccrafty, clever lyrics...joyous and stomping.\u201d The group took home the Living Blues Award for Best Live Performer in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

The Associated Press says, \u201cWilliams fills Chicago\u2019s biggest shoes with more life and heat than anyone on stage today.\u201d With The Big Sound Of Lil\u2019 Ed & The Blues Imperials, the band continues to bring their blistering Chicago blues to \u201cEd Heads\u201d new and old.

Lil\u2019 Ed, Pookie, Mike and Kelly have seen sports stars and presidents, musical fads and fashion trends come and go.

In high school the Stones, Clapton and Mayall first came out but Dave traded those records for Howlin' Wolf, Lightnin Hopkins, and BB King. After high school Weld moved to New Mexico, and studied guitar under Kurt Black, a jazz a jazz player who worked with Benny Carter, Grant Green and others in the New York jazz scene. Dave drove to Nevada and met and jammed with Gatemouth Brown. Weld bought Hound Dog Taylor's first Alligator album, heard Howlin Wolf over the radio in the desert one night, packed up and drove back home to Chicago, in his 67' Ford, and made it with $10 to spare. Dave found out the West side of Chicago in the black hood was friendlier than the North side, and started sitting in at clubs. Dave's first band! Hound Dog Taylor's group of Brewer Philips and Ted Harvey. They had been working with JB Hutto after Hound Dog's death, and after they came back from Boston broke it off with JB Hutto, they found a little house gig at Sweet Pea's and that's when Weld joined the band and played with them for a year. While he was there a year, he grew to know the wide end of the blues, there were shake dancers and fistfights. The gig ended when Brewer was stabbed in the throat by his wife, but they reconciled. Note of History: Brewer Philip and Ted Harvey are well known because their music started Alligator Records, the world largest blues label. Brewer learned from Memphis Minnie, one of the most famous women in blues history! Their recordings and tours with Hound Dog over 16 years signaled an increase in popularity of the blues in middle class America. Weld then moved to the 1815 Club on W. Roosevelt, owned and operated by Eddie Shaw who had Howlin Wolfs band, the Wolf Pack. Dave stayed there and played in the band with Chico Chism, Lafayette Gilbert, Hubert Sumlin, Detroit Junior, and Eddie Shaw. The going rate was $15 per night, but Dave played there with Otis Rush, Maxwell St. Jimmy, Guitar Junior, Jew Town Burks, Doug Macdonald, Boston Blackie, Tail Dragger, Little Wolf, Big Bad Ben, Little Aurthur, Johnny Littlejohn and more. The gig ended when the band was taken to the Maxwell St. lockup because of some provoative moves by the nude dancers. Shaw as a great friend bailed them all out. During this time Weld also was a writer for the \"Living Blues Magazine\" where he met J.B. Hutton and did a cover story on him. His encounter with the Legendary Slideman came to him in a dream right before meeting him, Weld saw a black man playing the slide with a wide friendly smile which was a true description of J.B.. They grew to be come great friends, meeting at J.B.'s house, Weld became his student for more that four years meeting every Tuesday at his house in Harvey. J.B. would have Dave back him up, and then make Dave play lead while J.B. backed him. They went to clubs together and Dave even booked J.B. at Sweet Lips on Lincoln where Dave had to pay the guys $5 each. They were at the 1815 club getting ready to play when the electric went out. They went to Theresa's to see Lightnin Slim, then they went to Brewers house to rehearse. Weld learned the ropes from the best bluesman around. In J.B.'s words, \"Blues will be Blues until the end of the world\", and taught Weld the philosophy and feel of bandleading, song writing, lead and rythm guitar.\"No matter what, don't let anybody, your girlfriend, your parents, your brother, your bandmembrs, NOBODY, tell you that you can't make it!\" \"You have to MAKE your fingers do it\". Weld's mentor, J.B. Hutto was a hall of fame bluesman, grammy winner and important during the \"rediscovery\" of bluesmen in the 60's. From Augusta Georgia, JB had sung with the Golden Crowns gospel group, but loved the blues. \"Write a song like a full grown man\", and when Dave went to visit JB in the hospital when he was dying of lung cancer he told Dave to take care of the band, with Little Ed. One day J.B. introduced Dave to his nephews, Lil Ed and James Young and thought they would be great together. So the trio started the band \"Lil Ed and the Blues Imperials\" and played every joint in the West side for ten years. Later Hutto developed cancer, it was a sad journey for Weld and the many hospital visits to see his friend and teacher. During Weld's many visits to the hospital ,J.B. told him to take care of the band, with Lil' Ed and to \"Write a song like a full grown man\". So Lil' Ed and the Blues Imperials continued on their journey as a band playign throughout the westside, hitting places like Boss Joe's Lounge on W Lake, where the guys made from $7 to $15 depending on the door, which there never was, but it kept Dave, Ed and Pookie playing. Another spot was The Garfield, at Homan and Madison which was right around the corner from Ed's house and featured Little Wolf, Hound Dog, and where the band stayed about a year. Necktie Nates at W Roosevelt was a hotbed of blues and during which Buster Benton came in to play quite a bit. The gig ended when Nate insulted Pookie's aunt and James jumped down off the stage to give Nate quite a lesson in manners. Throghout their small paying gigs, they were noticed byl Bruce Igauer from Alligator Records, which recorded them in a historic session \"Roughousin'\" and they started world tours. Years later, Dave wanted his music to grow in his direction and decided to start his own band, seeking use his own style and started \"Dave Weld and the Imperial Flames\" in 1988. Weld came out with their first CD \"Roughrockin' in Chicago\", on Parsifal Records in Belgium, and Dave toured Europe, Canada and Japan with his own band. A few years later, Lil' Ed joined Dave's band twice for two years this each time their reunion formed a recording for Earwig Music, \"Keep on Walkin'\", and this brought them overseas again, as well as local, regional, and national gigs. The final time Ed went back to form another Blues Imperials, he was replaced by the great Abb Locke, legndary sax man who became an intricate part of the band along with Jeff Taylor on drums and vocals and Herman Applewhite on bass. They continued working every week since 1988, traveling all over the world. In 2001, Weld met Monica Myhre through a benefit he played for Art Gustufson the former Vice President of The Crossroads Blues Society. Myhre at the time was singing with another group and was a very active member of the blues society, forming the first Blues In The Schools for the area and later replacing Art Gustufson as Vice President. Weld found out Myhre's musical background and formed a friendship discovering their joint writing abilities and mutual song ideas. Weld heard her sing for the first time after two years of knowing her and the rest is history. Now for the first time in 2003, a female singer was added to The Imperial Flames. Working harder than ever Weld kept his band together along with his devotion and care of his mother. After her passing, the many songs that had developed throughout the years became their first album with Delmark Records. Sadly their longtime bassman, Herman Applewhite left due to an illness and was replaced shortly with Dave Kaye. The group was signed by Delmark Records and came out with their first Album \"Burn'in Love\". Just the tip of the iceberg. A great beginning for the band with Delmark and receiving much acclaim throughout the States and Europe. The band traveled all over bringing them to a tour the UK tour and appearing at the Maryport Blues Festival and opening for Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins and the Legendaries Blues Band! Dave and his band come out with their second Delmark this time bring full throttle to the blues world. Their second Delmark album,\"Slip Into A Dream\" which included Grammy winner Bobby Rush on harp,well known Boston saxman, Sax Gordon and Buddy Guy's son Greg Guy. The album received even greater reviews than the first one. Nominated for best Rock Blues of 2016, nominated for best Contemporary Blues album, nominated for best song \"Take Me Back\" (as song of yesterdays in Chicago and the longing to return to those days), rated number two in the IBBA in the United Kingdom, several cover stories in magazines in Germany, Netherlands, Italy and the United States. This brought the band to a full circle of success, but in deep sadness loosing legendary saxman, Abb Locke to illness and retirement in 2016 but not before performing one more time with the band as headliner of the McHenry Blues Festival. Locke was replaced with renown saxman, Rogers Randle, Jr. replaced for a short time and then he was replaced by Dudley Owens and also replacing David Kaye with well known bassman Kenny Pickins fromerly from the Junior Wells/Buddy Guy band. The bands new line up consists of Dave Weld,Guitar/Vocals Monica Myhre, Percussion/Vocals, Jeff Taylor, Drums/Vocal, Kenny Pickens, Bass Rogers Randle, Jr, Sax and Harry Yaseem on Piano. The group is now in the midst of presenting a third album the end of the year!

After being eliminated in the top 32, she went right back to serving tables, while using the weekends to tour up and down the California coast, organically growing her fanbase and repertoire, while attempting to capitalize on her appearance on the hit reality singing competition, \u201cThe Voice\u201d. When COVID-19 hit, the restaurant Lauren worked at was inevitably shutdown and all future shows were indefinitely cancelled. With no means of income and a citywide lockdown, Lauren was eventually forced to move back into her parents\u2019 home in the Midwest. Lauren now works from home, while pursuing and perfecting her craft. She throws concerts every Tuesday on her  Instagram & Facebook pages and plays live shows every weekend, all around the Chicagoland area.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "8526 W Golf Rd, Niles, IL 60714", "Artist": "Grupo Mojado ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [42.0566877, -87.8373627], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "CANDELA", "moreBioInfo": "Cumbia y Romanticos, este grupo es uno's de los mejores de los noventas.", "otherInfo": "BRYNDIS POR SIEMPRE - GRUPO MOJADO - LALO Y LOS DESCALZOS"}, {"Address": "2445 Church Rd, Aurora, IL 60502", "Artist": "BXS ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.8051558, -88.2845101], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "EL ALAMO", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "BRYNDIS POR SIEMPRE - GRUPO MOJADO - LALO Y LOS DESCALZOS"}, {"Address": "2445 Church Rd, Aurora, IL 60502", "Artist": "Lalo y Los Descalzos ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.8051558, -88.2845101], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "EL ALAMO", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "BRYNDIS POR SIEMPRE - GRUPO MOJADO - LALO Y LOS DESCALZOS"}, {"Address": "2447 N Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60614", "Artist": "Gramps The Vamp ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.9268546, -87.64856329999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Golden Dagger", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "GOLDEN DAGGER PRESENTS:GRAMPS THE VAMP w/ Groovy Louie And The Time Capsules$10 // 21+Tickets are required to attend.

The daughter of gospel singer Josephine Howard of the legendary group The Caravans,and Clay Graham of Pilgrim Jubilees, Howard was discovered by R & B group Side Effect at age 16. About 1985, Howard decided she was ready to begin a solo career. A demo in the right hands landed a recording contract at Atlantic Records. Her first hit for Atlantic was the Billboard R&B top ten single \"Come Share My Love\". She followed that with a remake of Glenn Miller's 1940 tune \"Imagination\". Her success continued with two more top ten singles, \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"That's What Love Is\". The latter was a duet with hit-making R&B crooner Gerald Levert, and was the result of the creative union Howard formed with Levert. The pair later became romantically involved, and that romance spawned one of Howard's biggest hits, \"Love Under New Management\". The song was written during their brief love affair, but was released after their romance had dissolved. In 1992 Howard portrayed Billie Holiday in Spike Lee's Malcolm X , followed by a featured role in John Singleton's Poetic Justice with pop icon Janet Jackson.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2100 W Belmont Ave, Chicago, IL 60618", "Artist": "Extraordinary Popular Delusions ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [41.9397248, -87.680948], "Date": "2021-07-26", "EventDate": "Jul. 26th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Beat Kitchen", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}]
