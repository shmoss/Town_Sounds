Originally they were known as the African Disciples. Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide). The members were: Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals), Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals). Joseph Hill, who came to symbolise the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. 2. an early-90s Vegan straight edge hardcore new school band. They featured Rich Thurston, John Wylie (of Morning Again), Damien Moyall (also Morning Again and As Friends Rust and currently working on a solo album), Josh Williams, and Gordon Tapley. www.myspace.com/xxxculturexxx", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "411 University St, Seattle, WA 98101", "Artist": "Context ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9617899.jpeg", "Coordinates": [47.6079957, -122.3338074], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Soul, Dubstep, Electronic, Drum, Funk, R&b, Bass, Rnb-soul, R&b/soul", "Time": "10:00 AM", "Venue": "Fairmont Olympic Hotel, Seattle", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "117 S Washington St, Seattle, WA 98104", "Artist": "The Black Tones ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10393490.jpeg", "Coordinates": [47.6005061, -122.3332235], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Garage Rock, Blues-punk, Afropunk, Blues-rock", "Time": "10:30 AM", "Venue": "Occidental Square", "moreBioInfo": "The Black Tones album title Cobain and Cornbread is a description of the band that lead singer/guitarist Eva came up with playing at a show, in answer to the most commonly asked question, \u201cWhat does your band sound like?\u201d This tasty adroitly description sums up her and her twin drummer Cedric David\u2019s Seattle-spawned punk-blues. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t even sound like our influences,\u201d she explains, \u201cSo the best way I found to describe The Black Tones was to talk about our environment we were raised around, which was a bunch of southerners living in the Northwest.\u201d Louisiana-bred, though born and raised in Seattle, The Black Tones\u2019 reference to grunge god Kurt and the Native American quick bread cuisine, evokes \u201cSouthern influences in the grey of the Northwest,\u201d Eva says. \u201cIt sort of creates this offspring of rebellion and soul. We eat gumbo in our flannel shirts, and we eat red beans and rice while head-banging!\u201d Music was a huge part of Eva and Cedric\u2019s childhood, their first shared fandom being for \u201cTurn Your Love Around\u201d by iconic vocalist and guitarist George Benson, which they would dance to together every time the radio played it. They enjoyed looking in at what their older siblings were digging on MTV, such as Jay Z, Nirvana, Blind Melon, Michael Jackson, and \u201c90s pop music was awesome too! And R&B like SWV, En Vogue, etc.,\u201d Eva says. In high school their tastes had drifted; Eva was introduced to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd. After high school she researched and grooved on the old blues and folk that had influenced those classic rock bands. At the same time, she and Cedric were also big World-Wide Wrestling fans \u2014 \u201cwe loved wrestling! Cedric loved it before I did, but then I became a fanatic too.\u201d They really enjoyed the hard rock music used in bouts, drawing them closer to heavy metal. About this time Cedric had started to play the drums and wanted to hear the songs that Eva was writing, which she found exciting. He matched drum parts to songs she had only worked out so far on guitar, later on getting a bass player and another guitarist. As soon as they had a few arranged, they were ready to start performing. They went through some changes: The Black Tones as a four piece only lasted for a while, then became a trio, \u201cbut Cedric and I were the founders and the only consistently reliable members, so now we just keep it as a duo, while hiring other musicians to play instruments live with us.\u201d Eva had also been in an all-girl punk band called BUST, but she ended up channeling everything into The Black Tones with Cedric. Through countless shows supporting a few early singles, The Black Tones felt they finally got their first big breakthrough opening for Death Cab for Cutie in an anniversary benefit for the Paramount Theater. \u201cThat was the biggest show we\u2019ve done!\u201d Eva exclaims. She gives credit for reaching that height to NighTrain, the all black female punk band that she says discovered and championed them when they had freshly started. For Cobain and Cornbread, The Black Tones are returning from their singles to work with the renowned, glorious grunge producer Jack Endino, introduced to them by Eva\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and music writer Jake Uitti. Jake had interviewed Jack and sent him their song \u201cWoman in Black\u201d without Eva\u2019s knowledge and Jack replied how much he loved it and wanted to work with The Black Tones. \u201cI was never really big on recording in a studio,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m a live show nut, I just love performing. Being in studios was always very stressful for me, but when we worked with Jack, that totally changed! It was the best recording experience I\u2019ve ever had. Jack is like a scientist, a chemist behind the soundboard. He had great ideas that strengthened each song. I\u2019ve never met anyone with an ear like his, it\u2019s unbelievable, though he\u2019s a calm, humble, kind, efficient, honest and very intelligent guy \u2014 I was so intimidated at first, I mean, here\u2019s the guy who recorded the Melvins, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and the list goes on. And now he\u2019s working with us and he\u2019s really into it!\u201d Cobain and Cornbread also features help from their friend Mason Lowe from Bread & Butter, on \u201cChubby and Tubby\u201d (a frenetic garage rock instrumental ode to the landmark Seattle variety store) and \u201cWelcome Mr. Pink\u201d (the band\u2019s autobiographical anthem). \u201cMason has a great ear and was really amazing to work with.\u201d Ed Brooks mastered all the songs on the record, with Jack checking back in to make sure he was looped on everything. \u201cAs a band we are of course rooting for the record, but it\u2019s even more special when everyone else is as well!\u201d There\u2019s something very unique about the songs (all originals save for a cover of \u201cRiver of Jordan\u201d) and sound unique about the minimalist sound Jack helped The Black Tones achieved, reminding one of the debuts from The Ramones to the Stooges to the Modern Lovers. Eva acknowledges the brute power of the album\u2019s sound, \u201cit\u2019s pretty vulnerable and raw and I like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are songs like \u2018Welcome Mr. Pink\u2019 where you can hear the click sound from me pressing down on the button to turn on my reverb pedal.\u201d Or in their righteous, ferocious Black Power anthem, \u201cKey of Black (They Want Us Dead),\u201d \u201cafter the second guitar chorus when I go back to the solo, I almost forgot to press my Wah Wah pedal back on so it comes in a little late. \u201cWe\u2019re not factory made or even ever scratch the surface of perfection, we\u2019re real people, this is real life and these little details remind me of the imperfections of life,\u201d she says. \u201cLife\u2019s real, life\u2019s the blues, coming from the heart. My doctor told me I have a slight heart murmur, well, so does our music!\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "203 W Thomas St, Seattle, WA 98119", "Artist": "Avian Invasion ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11324074.jpeg", "Coordinates": [47.620803, -122.359704], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Progressive Trance, Deep House, Future House, Trance, Progressive House", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "The DJ Sessions 7B's Brunch Series", "moreBioInfo": "www.avianinvasion.com", "otherInfo": "The DJ Sessions and the Queen Anne Beer Hall have teamed up to bring you one of the best brunches in the city better known as the 7B\u2019s Brunch\u2026\n\nBENEDICTS, BRATS, BURGERS, BEERS, BLOODY\u2019S, BACON, AND BEATS BRUNCH.\n\nEvery Saturday starting at Noon you can come to the \u201cHall\u201d and start you day with and awesome assortment of menu items that will make your mouth water while at the same time be part of one of the world\u2019s most popular live streaming DJs series."}, {"Address": "2125 Queen Anne Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109", "Artist": "Carly Ann Calbero ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11365315.jpeg", "Coordinates": [47.6380011, -122.3572265], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Folk, Rock, Alternative", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Paragon's Acoustic Brunch", "moreBioInfo": "Seattle musician", "otherInfo": "One of the coolest stages in the city.

The rest of the population will catch up. What this means is that Chromeo is really good at being Chromeo. The mission, the package, the vision\u2014it\u2019s been a straight shot of pure intentionality from the jump. These Chromeo dudes? They have the whole being-these-Chromeo-dudes thing totally wired. And with the benefit of blessed hindsight, we can all see now that Chromeo stuck to it with the natural doggedness of the soulful heirs that they are. Funk a game plan\u2014these guys had a ten-year battle strategy. When they released their first album in 2004, Rick James was still the Antichrist to all but the enlightened. Fast forward to today, and \u201880s funk\u2014which makes up a major part of Chromeo\u2019s DNA\u2014is all over the charts. So it\u2019s the perfect time for a fresh dose of the real stuff and\u2014lo and behold\u2014Pee (still looking a smooth criminal in a Coogi) and Dave (ever the Semitic/Gallic heartthrob in tight pants) are back. We are officially on the cusp of the Canadian funk lords\u2019 fourth album\u2019s release. It\u2019s called White Women and it\u2019s a doozy. As a work of cultural theory, it posits that we are living in a post-nostalgia age. All previous genres and styles of music now coexist within a singularity of moves and gestures. (Ouch, sorry, got possessed by a cultural studies prof. for a second there\u2026 but the foregoing is true of Chromeo, just FYI.) More importantly, as pure entertainment, White Women perpetuates and elevates Chromeo\u2019s existing blueprint: sexy funk, ass-targeting beats, melodic honey, and smart lyrics about the foibles of contemporary love. Dave 1\u2019s words continue to turn urban music clich\u00e9s on their heads. On \u201cJealous (I Ain\u2019t With It)\u201d, a Chromeo crossover comet if there ever was one, our arch antihero witnesses his ex in the arms of other guys\u2026 wearing the jacket that he bought her. Conversely, the pristinely produced \u201cOver Your Shoulder\u201d is a paean to the insecure. You\u2019re all beautiful, ladies, is the message; don\u2019t even sweat that body-image noise. And \u201cSexy Socialite\u201d is a warning to the highhanded party girls of the early twenty-teens. Check yourself, sayeth Chromeo. White Women is the band at its most ambitious, with both the pop and the muso elements of Chromeo pushed into the red. On the hooky side, we\u2019ve got instant classics like the soaring \u201cCome Alive\u201d and the pulsating \u201cFrequent Flyer\u201d which offer moments that would make Hall & Oates and Wham green with envy. On the crate-digger side, Dave and Pee employ an unprecedented analog arsenal that would make Kraftwerk drool. Mtume\u2019s female vocalist croons on more than half the album. Steely Dan\u2019s string conductor pops up on the progressive album closer \u201cFall Back 2U.\u201d Try all that on for size, nerds. But for all that 80s talk, White Women, more so than any other Chrome-opus, is firmly grounded in pop\u2019s present. It features some stellar cameos, too. Solange belts it out with Dave 1 on \u201cLost On The Way Home,\u201d Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend contributes the piano-led, heartstring-pulling intermezzo \u201cEzra\u2019s Interlude,\u201d and Toro y Moi dives into the undiluted electro-funk of the aforementioned \u201cCome Alive.\u201d 2014 happens to be the Year of the Horse, which makes sense because Chromeo are about gallop in on shining white steeds to delicately trample all of us with their sublime sound.

I began to mess around with basic mixing software and started making random mixes. 2009: I moved back to Kansas City and had the opportunity to study abroad in Barcelona, Spain. I was overwhelmed with the dance music scene out there. It was amazing and I fully embraced it and submerged myself in it. The time I spent there changed my life forever. Unfortunately, when I came back from Barcelona I contracted Mono and I was out of commission for a month. My sister bought me a very basic audio mixer to help me pass the time and I never looked back. 2009-2010: At this point I had gotten the hang of basic mixing and my roommate at the time Deep Singh was mastering the Dholi (Indian Drum). With the help of parental investors we got together and decided to form DK Productions. We had the equipment and we hit the streets to market the brand. Soon after we started getting our first gigs, and from there the rest was history. This was the time when I chose the name Dj eKleCtic. 2011-2013: More DK. With each event we got better and better. Together Deep and I would bounce ideas off each other and integrate them into our sets. I also started working on my own club gig/events and started really getting the eKleCtic name out there. 2014-2017: I decided to leave Kansas City and move to Seattle. The first year in Seattle I was going to concerts left and right: hip hop, edm, trap, etc. You name it and I was there. I was taking it all in, gaining influence on how to build a set and captivate a crowd. These years were spent mainly in the studio perfecting my craft and working on mixes to share with the world. During this time I was doing a lot of pre-made mixes for friends and old customers back in KC. 2018: I decided to retire Dj eKleCtic and rebrand as DJ KP. It is like Kobe going from 8 to 24. I am a different person with a much different approach to how I dj now. I have been influenced by so many artists in the last 9 years and collectively I have shaped my own style.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1809 Minor Ave, Seattle, WA 98101", "Artist": "Mister Moon ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9020210.jpeg", "Coordinates": [47.6168853, -122.3311713], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Timbre Room", "moreBioInfo": "\"The syncopated drums are to die for.

Here's local Beatlemaniac and all around great radio host and friend MIKE WEST (Host of KZOK's \"Breakfast With The Beatles\"): \"This past Friday I went to the Historic Everett Theater to see the band 'WingsNThings' perform the entire Wings Kingdome performance that happened 40 years ago to the day. My Quick Review: Man... WingsNThings... we gave away tickets to this show and I wish everyone could've gone. They did an EPIC job doing the entire show from their spot-on musicianship to the actual horn section to the lasers and the smoke and the whole thing, it was just a flashback. It was like going back in time and these guys are awesome. So if you've never seen WingsNThings before, I am officially endorsing them now. I highly recommend that you see them.\" (Hear Mike's Endorsement) Listen to Mike's Show \"Breakfast With The Beatles\" on KZOK 102.5 FM EVERY Sunday at 8AM!", "otherInfo": "WingsNThings: The Music of Paul McCartney is back to where it all started for us - ISSAQUAH!
