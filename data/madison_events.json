For twenty years, the Madison, Wisconsin-based group has purely and fearlessly followed its inner artistic continuum. Natty Nation\u2019s unique pedigree of a Midwest home base and artistic openness has helped the posse foster a signature sound. The group describes themselves as hard roots rock reggae & dub because in addition to their honest and authentic roots reggae foundation, their embrace of soul, rock, and funk is undeniable. Natty Nation is also influenced by such diverse geniuses as Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Living Colour, Earth Wind and Fire, Fishbone, and Bad Brains. Currently, Natty Nation is led by JAH Boogie \u2013 bass & lead vocals (also percussion & drums in the studio), and musical director Aaron Konkol \u2013 keyboards, vocals, & melodica. The collective also features mainstays Paule Willis \u2013 drums, and Nick Czar \u2013 guitar. Divine Spark is a lightning bolt of an inspirational album artistically and introspectively. JAH Boogie explains: \u201cThe Divine Spark is the higher self within everyone. I've learned that through raising your vibration, and opening your chakras, you are able to tap into your divine spark.\u201d Artistically it\u2019s a watershed album as its was carefully crafted by the creative core of founding member JAH Boogie, and longtime member Aaron Konkol, who is a multi-instrumentalist and prodigious musical talent. The two shared in music writing responsibilities while JAH Boogie retained lyric duties. Highlights on Divine Spark include the title track, \u201cMeditation,\u201d \u201cCivil Rights,\u201d and \u201cProphecy.\u201d The album\u2019s spiritual core is the simmering and soulful title track. \u201cThis song deals with the spiritual essence of each human being,\u201d JAH Boogie explains. \u201cThe song also expresses that when you open your heart chakra it helps to open up the many other chakras within the spiritual body. When these energy centers or chakras are open then many other dimensions are open as well.\u201d \u201cMeditation\u201d aptly conjures its name with sweetly languid grooves. Soul rebel militancy bubbles over with the aptly titled, \u201cCivil Rights\u201d courtesy of F. Stokes\u2019s fiery rhymes. And the rousing \u201cProphecy\u201d is sure to inspire self-reflection. \u201cThis song deals with going within yourself to find out who you really are or what you really are. We all have spiritual guides or angels who reveal certain things to us,\u201d explains JAH Boogie. Divine Spark was mixed by legendary Bob Marley recording engineer Errol Brown (Rebelution, Gregory Isaacs, Burning Spear, among others). Errol mixed the album in his makeshift studio he built in the back of Rebelution's tour bus. He worked closely with Aaron Konkol\u2019s feedback and the two came up with a majestic mix.

In just three months, \u201cLie\u201d raced up Music Row\u2019s Top 50, making it the chart\u2019s most added song in 2017. This momentum carried over into his self-tilted EP, which was featured on iTunes Country for six weeks in a row. With this attention, Canaan was soon featured on premier country outlets like Whiskey Riff, The Boot, and Sounds Like Nashville. Canaan\u2019s musical abilities should come as no surprise, though, as he comes from such a musical household. His father blasted Conway Twitty records, his mother\u2019s band played all over the southeast, and his seven sisters ensured he had his share of the boy bands. Although Canaan is constantly touring, music isn\u2019t the only thing that sets his soul on fire. He has a BFA in Musical Theatre and has every intention of putting his acting skills to work. Whether behind the camera or in front of it, Canaan has a deep passion for cinematography. Canaan\u2019s involved in all aspects of production for his stand-out music videos, including directing, editing, choreography, and, of course, starring in them. Releasing singles like, \u201cTake My Time,\u201d \u201cGreener,\u201d \u201cOut of Nowhere,\u201d and \u201cLong Way Home,\u201d Canaan has led his fans down a path of catchy and relatable hits. Despite being an indie artist, this lineup has earned him enough attention to book shows across the US and even headline his own overseas tours", "otherInfo": "Welcoming back Nashville artist, Canaan Cox.

Starting with her moms 90's hip hop CD, she knew every word to every song. Then came Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, Martina McBride, Dixie Chicks, and many more 90's country artists to push the passion along. Starting to sing in school at a young age, Bree was always ready to take center stage, no fright, and perform to her best. Grade school in Mauston, WI turned into middle and high school in Westfield, WI, and musicals became a big part of life, performing in Fiddler on the Roof, The Music Man and her favorite, Ado Annie in Oklahoma, along with doing everything she could in band, playing the clarinet and performing in color guard, and choir, when she sang 1st soprano down to 1st tenor. Getting her first guitar from her Dad and Step-mom the Christmas after her senior year, opened up a whole new world of song writing. Bree played her first full song on the guitar for her dad June 15th, 2013, and will remember her fathers face and tears as one of the many things that will push her for her dreams. Attending UW- La Crosse after high school for a year, Bree learned that the college life wasn't for her. After finishing out her year at UW-L, she found new music friends back in Hometown, Mauston, WI. Starting off with karaoke shows, she quickly learned music is what she was born to do. In the spring of 2014, Exit 69 Feat. Bree Morgan was born, and later Bree was introduced to Kyle Roberts, a 17 year old blues guitarist from Mauston, WI, who she wrote songs, and played acoustic shows with. Although Bree has been in the band business for only a little over 6 years, she has met many great musicians and found who her friends are in the music community in little ol' Mauston, WI, a place she will forever call home. After singing for a year with Shotgun Jane, Bree decided to continue on as a musician for hire, filling in for bands, performing acoustically, solo and duo shows, and now running her own band again, along side live music lover Derrick Roenneburg, Bree Morgan Reloaded, a hard hitting country band, bringing a boot-stomping, music from all decades!", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "W11070 WI-16, Columbus, WI 53925", "Artist": "MG Bailey ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11054305.jpeg", "Coordinates": [43.3314965, -88.94206849999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Soul, Rock, Punk, Americana, Roots", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "MG Bailey plays The Old Rock", "moreBioInfo": "MG Bailey is a one man Rock n' Roll band that brings energy, honesty, and a few laughs to every show.
