The six-piece band has come a long way since forming just three years ago. From their explosive performances to their tireless work ethic TWC is on the cusp of becoming the next big thing in the world of pop-country. Two Way Crossing, the brainchild of talented husband and wife duo Jenny and Blake Marvin, was originally formed in Denver, CO. In the Spring of 2014 they relocated to Nashville, TN to surround themselves with some of the best writers, performers, and producers in the business. The duo and band that travels with them devotes ample time to rehearsing and on stage they appear as a well-oiled machine -- a tough feat especially for a band this size.

His second full-length album Raise A Banner (out on April 16) was recorded and slated for a 2020 release but shelved along with so many other projects from artists around the world. Despite the delay - perhaps in a silver lining moment - the album\u2019s themes are now more apropos than ever: fighting through hardship, searching for truth in a world of lies, enduring personal loss. Produced by Sadler Vaden at Nashville\u2019s Creative Workshop, Raise A Banner is a long-jumper\u2019s leap forward for Schmidt and an exclamatory flag-planting of a commanding voice in the Americana genre, establishing him amongst the ilk with whom he recorded. Backing him throughout the album is Jason Isbell\u2019s 400 Unit (Jimbo Hart, Chad Gamble, Derry Deboria, and Vaden, with Isbell even contributing electric guitar on the barn-burning Foregone Conclusion), and longtime contributors, vocalist Jackie Berkley and pedal steel wingman Adam Kurtz. Bringing a blue-collar sensibility from his Pittsburgh upbringing to a Nashville Americana sound, the mix is gritty yet refined, emotional but unwavering, and reflective while forward-looking. The songwriting of Raise A Banner runs the gamut of life experience: \u201cForegone Conclusion\u201d is the soundtrack for ripping it up with friends on a Friday night at your local honky-tonk, \u201cYou\u2019re Still On My Mind\u201d pairs well with emotionally hungover Saturday mornings, and tunes like the album-titled folky groove invite quiet head-nodding while pondering the hypocrisy of Sunday morning religious virtue signalers. \u201cThe record Raise a Banner was written from a place of uncertainty,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cUncertainty of the world that surrounds us in hopes that this album can tell stories of the broken in order to bring light back to dark times.\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Dance\u201d\u2019s slow-rolling Southern rock will shake some dust off the boots of Drive By Truckers and Springsteen devotees; the warm, punchy, warbly Hammond B3 organ is a perfect sonic metaphor for Schmidt\u2019s big, oaky timbre throughout the album. It\u2019s tunes like \u201cYou\u2019re Still on My Mind\u201d and \u201cBack Around\u201d - when an acoustic guitar and keys combo or simply acoustic and vocals accompaniment - that one can isolate the potent creative and soulful range of Schmidt\u2019s voice. Like some moments in life, on Raise A Banner sometimes it takes the pauses and the quieter moments to balance the effusive; when you really have to listen for you to hear the power of what\u2019s being said. Raise A Banner is that silver lining moment for Zach Schmidt.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1921 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "Roderick August ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8740455.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1495723, -86.7977289], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "The Stillery Midtown", "moreBioInfo": "Roderick grew up playing piano, self taught by learning whatever MTV was playing in the early 2000\u2019s.

He discovered his voice by chance after being coerced into singing Ray Charles at a Filipino karaoke party. By high school, he adopted the guitar and songwriting above a GPA while spending time in various indie bands around Ventura County. Shortly after high school he was discovered by a small Nashville publishing company and was soon off to Tennessee to live the air conditioned and often, isolated life of a songwriter. All there was to do in Nashville for him was write, record, write, record and he began to wonder when things would shift back to a stage, an audience, an experience involving more people than himself. He began traveling back to his home state of California more often, initially as a release but all the back and forth began to have a strong pull on his sound. The carefree, let it flow sound he originally harnessed while in California was now being married to the roots and bluesy aura that grew on him in Tennessee.

With her megawatt smile and unmistakable throwback style, she lights up every room she enters. But don\u2019t let the glamorous Farrah Fawcett-inspired hair fool you: this girl is the country music you\u2019ve been missing. Born just outside of Waco, Texas in the tiny town of Lorena, Kimberly\u2019s childhood was a very musical one. Her grandfather Sterling Kelly fronted a band called Sterling Kelly and the Hearts and was a fixture in the Texas country music scene. Her father was a mechanic who blasted anything from Stevie Nicks to Lynyrd Skynyrd in his truck as they rode into town. Her mother, a hairdresser, introduced both her and her singer-songwriter sister to Patty Loveless and Gary Stewart as the three racked up the miles in their old Honda hatchback. In fact, there aren\u2019t many memories from Kimberly\u2019s early days that didn\u2019t involve music. \u201cIt\u2019s my common connection with other people,\u201d Kelly says. It\u2019s her way of communicating, evident in the conversational nature of her songs. Listening to her melodies and lyrics is like talking with an old friend in a swaying porch swing. It\u2019s real and you feel it. Part of Kelly\u2019s lyrical magic lies in her humor and heart, and her willingness to be frank and hold nothing back from her audience. \u201cI want my music to say \u2018I feel you.\u2019 That\u2019s so important to me,\u201d Kelly says with such sincerity. \u201cWe\u2019re all living our different lives but at some point we\u2019ve felt the same feelings, and I think those emotions are tapped into through songs. Sometimes it\u2019s a beer drinking song\u2014I\u2019ve felt the same way you\u2019ve felt getting ready for a night out. I\u2019ve had my heart broken and been homesick. So I want my songs to tell people, \u2018I\u2019ve been there, too.\u2019 Live it up, whatever moment you\u2019re in. We\u2019re in this thing together.\u201d And there are some of those very songs in Kelly\u2019s catalogue. There\u2019s \u201cDaddy\u2019s 8-Track,\u201d a nostalgic reflection on her father\u2019s musical taste and influence in her formative years. And \u201cPut Some Lipstick On It,\u201d an empowering revenge anthem for the brokenhearted. But then there\u2019s the love songs, like \u201cDon\u2019t Blame It On Me,\u201d a ballad trenched so deeply in Countrypolitan romance that you feel like you\u2019re floating across the floor at Gilley\u2019s with Bud and Sissy. But no matter the melodic or lyrical variation, one thing is consistent about Kelly: she\u2019s stone cold country in every shape, form and fashion. \u201cI try not to be influenced by trends,\u201d Kelly says with a smile. \u201cSure, I listen to all kinds of music. But at the end of the day, I know what\u2019s in my heart, and I always come back to it: country music. I always have and I always will.\u201d That\u2019s a promise we can all count on.", "otherInfo": "Kimberly will be performing an acoustic set in-store- sponsored by Durango Boots."}, {"Address": "121 3rd Ave S, Nashville, TN 37201", "Artist": "Noah Garner Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [36.1607047, -86.7757672], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:30 PM", "Venue": "Full Band", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Johnny Cash Bar- SECOND FLOOR\n1:30p-5:30p"}, {"Address": "121 3rd Ave S, Nashville, TN 37201", "Artist": "Katrina Austin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10432222.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1607047, -86.7757672], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "1:30 PM", "Venue": "Johnny Cash's Kitchen & Saloon", "moreBioInfo": "Nashville, TN singer/songwriter", "otherInfo": "2ND FLOOR 1:30 PM - 5:30 PM"}, {"Address": "1028 16th Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "Meg Williams ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11296560.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1446885, -86.7926269], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Acoustic Roots, Classic Rock, Rock, Americana, Soul-blues, Roots Rock, Americana Roots, Southern Rock, Blues, Soul, Blues-rock", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Bobby's Idle Hour", "moreBioInfo": "Nashville-based guitarist, songwriter, and singer, Meg Williams, performs at notable venues across the country with her full band, as a solo/duo act, and as a guitarist for other artists.

He attended Eastern Illinois University, where he continued his football success as a linebacker, starting his career as a walk-on and ending it on a full-ride scholarship.

Days later Jake landed a gig at Tootsie\u2019s Orchid Lounge on Broadway in downtown Nashville and has been playing there ever since.

He loves every day of work, whether at Tootsie\u2019s or entertaining at any event across North America.

It was the key to an entirely different world. His life changed when, as a teen, he secretly rode the school bus to a friend\u2019s house and played the guitar for the first time. From then on, he immersed himself in music, learning guitar and playing every chance he got. He practiced incessantly\u2014so much that his dad finally bought him his own guitar, just to keep him at home. Harris recalls, \u201cI remember at the time feeling like I had found a treasure chest.\u201d Not long after, he attended a bluegrass festival in his hometown of Unicoi, Tennessee. He witnessed the mayor of the town get up and join a band as the drummer, and he was mesmerized by the fact that the mayor was playing the drums at the festival. Soon he was spending every waking moment on a drum kit and volunteering to play at local festivals. Harris further reveals, \u201cWhen I was 16, I would skip school and just play and play. The only thing that kept me in school was my involvement in school sports, which provided the social interaction I needed with other kids, as I was very shy.\u201d As the years went by, Harris pursued a variety of music avenues. In 2009 he travelled to Nashville and auditioned for a local rock band, \u201cThe Showdown,\u201d and landed the gig. That led to spending the next two years on the road, living the rock star life to the fullest until the band broke up in 2012. A friend and Harris decided to open a music store in their hometown, and he started giving drum lessons. During this time, he worked on music for a film production company and wrote jingles for Amway. What Harris really wanted, however, was to return to Nashville and join the Broadway scene of live entertainment. In 2014, he found day work at the legendary honky-tonk \u201cTootsies.\u201d Harris worked his way up from being the greeter at the door handing out flyers to bar-backing. He eventually moved up the ladder further by subbing on drums, and in 2018 he stepped out in front of the drum kit for the first time and sang whenever the lead singer of the band took breaks. Now Harris fronts his own shows and has fans from all over the world. Harris has found inspiration in the powerhouse vocals of Brandon Boyd of Incubus, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Elton John, The Eagles and Chris Stapleton. In 2017, Brett Young and a label representative saw Harris performing on Broadway and were impressed with his talents. This resulted in Harris being offered one of Young\u2019s self-penned songs, \u201cYou Still Got It.\u201d This gesture gave Harris the drive he needed and a moment he will never forget. Harris is busy writing songs such as \u201cWhiskey Revival\u201d and \u201cRedneck of the Woods\u201d and performing around Nashville, sharing the stage with artists like Brett Eldredge, Thomas Rhett, Scotty McCreery and Kid Rock.

The musical blending of her traditional Slovenian roots with country, folk and pop music - with a high-energy performance - has garnered her worldwide recognition as an established artist and a leading innovator of what is considered a new generation of polka. LynnMarie was born and raised in the Cleveland suburb of Maples Heights, Ohio, and was destined to pick up an accordion. Her grandparents immigrated to the United States in the early 1900s from Slovenia, and her first introduction to the diatonic button accordion was watching her grandfather, Anton Miklaus, play his 1920s Mervar accordion. Singing and dancing as part of the Planina Junior Chorus would form the foundation of her musical career. Her father, Ludwig Hrovat, an accomplished accordion player and bandleader, was her first inspiration as a musician and as an entertainer. At the age of 11, she took lessons from family friend Johnny Hrovat and by the age of 13, LynnMarie was singing and playing regularly at local clubs and festivals across the Midwest as a member of the Wolf Family Band. The group, consisting of her and her four teenaged cousins, traveled throughout Ohio bringing their infectious polka music to enthusiastic crowds. In the early 1970s, when the button box had a resurgence in the area due in part to legends like Lojze Slak and Frank Novak, LynnMarie could be seen competing at one of the many button box contests, or performing with local Cleveland favorites Joey Tomsick and Kathy Hlad. During high school and college, LynnMarie\u2019s attentions were focused on her theatre and television aspirations, but it was a trip to Slovenia in 1989 that would plunge her back into the polka music world. It was on this trip that the duo of \u201cJoey T. & LynnMarie\u201d was born. The duo recorded two albums together and was honored in 1990 by the National Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame with the \u201cBest Button Box\u201d award. LynnMarie would receive the honor in 1992 as an individual. In 1991, LynnMarie expounded on her musical roots by releasing an exercise video to polka music entitled Polkaerobics with LynnMarie. Using some of Cleveland\u2019s best-known musicians, the video was the first to combine Cleveland-style polkas with exercise. After the release of her first solo project in 1992, Coast to Coast, LynnMarie made the move to Nashville, Tennessee. Legendary guitarist Chet Atkins invited LynnMarie to perform with him, and encouraged her to take her ethnic roots music to a broader audience. Collaborating with different musicians and songwriters influenced not only her writing, but her playing and her vocal style as well. In 1996, the American Slovenian Polka Foundation named her Euro-America\u2019s Button Accordion Queen. During this time, LynnMarie was a special guest with many bands including Steve Meisner, Don Wojtila, and the Eddie Rodick Orchestra, and was a featured player with the GRAMMY-winning Jimmy Sturr Orchestra. Her first Nashville-produced album, One Look, contained the single, \"That's What I Like About The North\u201d, and it became the most requested song in the history of Cleveland\u2019s WGAR Country Morning Radio Show in 1998. LynnMarie has received five GRAMMY nominations: SqueezeBox (2000), The Polka Record (2002), LynnMarie + the Boxhounds (2003), Party Dress (2007), and Speechless (2009). In 2006, she released her first European album, LynnMarie \u2013 America\u2019s Polka Queen. She has performed live on the Grand Ole Opry, CNN, CMA Fan Fair, South By Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, and every major festival in between, bringing her high energy and unique polka style to audiences throughout the United States and Europe. Her expertise as a diatonic button accordionist combined with her engaging stage presence has wowed fans, critics, and media alike. Jay Leno, host of The Tonight Show referred to LynnMarie as \"the Dixie Chick of Polka\u201d, and Rolling Stone Magazine said, \u201cLynnMarie is one soulful polka diva!\u201d In 2012, she wrote and starred in Wrap Your Heart Around It, a musical dramedy based on her life experiences of growing up in an ethnic home and becoming the mother of a special needs child, and using her accordion to enhance this true-life story. It was produced by Emmy-winning director Paul Miller and performed in front of sold-out audiences in New York City and Los Angeles. The show was awarded \u201cBest New Production\u201d by the United Solo Theatre Festival in 2012. She followed up that success with a six-week run at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, California, about which the LA Times said, \u201c\u2026LynnMarie\u2019s unforced warmth and affecting candor amounts to a one-woman love bomb. [It has been a while since] Los Angeles witnessed so genuinely inspirational a personal memoir. I dare you not to wrap your heart around it.\u201d Following the success of the play, Post Hill Press published her memoir, also called Wrap Your Heart Around It. She blogs weekly about her life with her son and in 2016, one of her stories went viral, reaching 4.4 million people. She continues to book speaking engagements, sharing her story of hope, encouragement, and music, as a motivational entertainer and public speaker. Throughout a career that spans over five decades, LynnMarie has performed and collaborated with many artists, including Willie Nelson, Flaco Jimenez, Dobie Gray, Riders In The Sky, and country music superstar Vince Gill. In 2018, she partnered in life and in music with one of Cleveland\u2019s finest musicians, Eddie Rodick III, to begin yet another phase in her exciting and adventurous musical life story.

Pulling from a wide variety of influences like Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, and Miley Cyrus among others, her music defies genre boundaries. Her music showcases her authentic Southern roots while also featuring catchy pop melodies and lyrics that dig deep into the truth of the human condition. Growing up a classically trained ballerina, Bonner danced as a senior member of the Academy of Classic Arts in Huntsville, Alabama, and won scholarships to dance with the Eglevsky Ballet in NYC as well as several other prestigious companies. At age twelve, she taught herself to play guitar with the help of YouTube and, after two years, Bonner begged her parents to let her take vocal lessons in Nashville. It was there that she met Bart Herbison, Executive Director of NSAI, who became her biggest champion and connected her with her first co-writers and creative collaborators. Soon thereafter, Bonner realized her true calling to be a singer-songwriter and she never looked back. Bonner left home for Nashville the week after she turned 17 where she continued to co-write and expand her network of industry professionals. During this time, she played multiple shows at The Bluebird Cafe, gained a residency at The Listening Room, and toured the Southeast. In 2014, she teamed up with bluegrass singer-songwriter Katie Mae Smith to form duo Little Honey, and spent the next two years recording and releasing music. They toured all over the southeastern United States, opening for powerhouse performers such as Charlie Daniels, The Band Perry, Mel Tillis, Lee Greenwood, and Shooter Jennings. After the pair decided to go their separate ways in 2016, she embarked on her solo career. Later that year, she performed at The Time Center in New York City by The Oxford Center of Entrepreneurs, where she received the Oxford Center Artist Entrepreneur award for her work. In the following years, Bonner found streaming success with her new releases. She released four songs, including \u201cSomeone New,\u201d \u201cSell Me On California,\u201d \u201cNothing To It,\u201d and her most recent, \u201cIn My Dreams,\u201d which racked up over 91.3k streams on Spotify alone. Bonner spent the majority of the previous year writing exclusively for her upcoming EP, due out later this year. Drawing upon her personal experiences for inspiration, she wrote the majority of the project with producer Izaac Burkhart and, on some songs, another close collaborator. In 2020, she also joined a collective of musicians known as The 615 House, which went viral on TikTok. The group amassed over 1M likes in 12 days and has since grown its follower base to 751.1k on TikTok and 45.6k on Instagram in only eleven months.

Stepping back, after completing his tour of duty as a U.S. Navy Sailor, Kyle decided to pursue playing Country music as his full-time profession. After gaining years of combined live shows, studio recordings and a good size catalog of self-penned songs under his belt, Kyle hit the road for Nashville to make a name for himself in Country Music. \"I love the idea of putting it all on the line and pursuing dreams that most people think are unattainable.

Chaffins finds his inspiration in diverse musical styles and personal experiences. Creating a new lane of country and Americana music laced with tinges of R&B and indie rock, his multi-genre sound is distinctive while being comfortably familiar. His debut solo album, Some Things Won\u2019t Last, released February 2020, was born from the constant evolution of Chaffins\u2019 music, honoring past experiences while always moving forward. Wide Open Country praised the nine-song album as \u201ceverything from fuzz-toned, drum-driven rockers to ballads laced with symphonic swells, not to mention a gorgeous cover of Keith Whitley's \u2018I'm Over You\u2019.\u201d NPR named Chaffins one of \u201cThe Best New Artists Playing AmericanaFest\u201d in 2019.

Videos for \u201cI\u2019m Over You\u201d and \u201cHer\u201d spent months on the fan-voted CMT 12-Pack Countdown, with \u201cHer\u201d reaching the No. 1 spot on the same day his debut album, Some Things Won\u2019t Last, was released. Chaffins is an indie artist who grew up along Kentucky\u2019s famed Country Music Highway 23 fascinated by the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s country music stars from there. In his teen years, Chaffins\u2019 ears were attracted to the hits on the radio, but by the end of high school, he had grown more interested in bluegrass and jazz. He moved to Louisville to study, curiously enough, classical voice on scholarship at Bellarmine University. After less than a year, he was drawn back to eastern Kentucky and Morehead State University to explore what its Kentucky Center for Traditional Music had to offer and to refocus on jazz. He moved to Middle Tennessee, but, after one year, graduate school was replaced with real life and real work as a musician. Chaffins quickly found his traction as an award-winning songwriter and an in-demand bassist. He was being recruited regularly for session work, including with renowned producers such as Buddy Miller and Dave Brainard. He spent years performing in bluegrass bands, including as bassist for Town Mountain and as vocalist and bassist for Rounder Records' The Deadly Gentlemen. Chaffins was ready to craft his own sound. His first solo album, born from the constant advancement of his music by honoring past experiences while always moving forward, created a new palate of sound that might not have existed before and invited diverse audiences that might not have come together before. Chaffins, who prides himself on embracing every kind of style from country and folk to pop and rock, makes a genuine effort to never limit his songwriting or his music. Today, he transforms the dichotomy of his experiences into a melodic, moody mix that highlights his assertive, soulful baritone and his command over a band\u2019s energy.

Country Artist JD Shelburne grew up on a tobacco farm in Taylorsville, KY, a tiny town southeast of the Ohio River near Louisville KY. At age 19, he found a guitar after the death of his grandmother and began learning to play and sing on his own. By his sophomore year of college, he had found a few gigs at some local bars in the Louisville/Lexington, KY area and developed a fan-base that eventually landed him on some of the biggest stages in the business, opening for some of the nation\u2019s hottest stars. Eventually, Shelburne was adding original songs into the set mix, in addition to producing songs of his own material. In 2002, Kentucky fell in love at first sight with Shelburne, then college student/ small-town country boy with a wide smile, natural singing voice and a love of faith, family and his hometown of Taylorsville, KY. But that small-town image is merely a fond memory now that he has moved on to Nashville down the path to music stardom. Now find him soaking up the music scene, touring cities, building a fan-base and celebrating a decade of success playing venues all across the southeast trying to get his big break. Today he\u2019s among the most hard working and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn\u2019t work that way anymore \u2013 that talented musicians with very few connections don\u2019t stand a chance. But Shelburne proved that Music City\u2019s engine still runs off of talent and persistent driven antics. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. Venues strive to book him. There are very few new artists recording songs today about whom that can be said. During his whirlwind career explosion, he has performed with over 50 national acts ranging from stars such as Montgomery Gentry, Craig Morgan, Jamey Johnson, Kellie Pickler, Steve Wariner to Clay Walker and Johnny Lee, performed at some of the region\u2019s most famous venues such as the Historic Ryman Auditorium, Rupp Arena, Murphy Center, KFC Yum Center, Freedom Hall, Churchill Downs and Old Cardinal Stadium which recently drew the Kentucky State Fair\u2019s largest crowd of the concert series.

He has also been featured in Country Weekly Magazine, Kentucky Alumni Magazine, Kentucky Monthly Magazine amongst many other national publications including the Huffington Post. His debut music video \u201cFarmboy\u201d gained him thousands of new fans by airing on the TNN Top Ten Countdown nationwide on Heartland TV network and ZUUS Country Network.

It dispenses the notions we held, waiting for the moments our thoughts would be proven true or join the myriad of misguided ideas and archaic thought processes. To Speak of Wolves has submitted themselves to time, and while searching vigorously, these 5 young men found that they could not live apart from what they had created. All it takes is a random vibration in your pocket today, and life can be catapulted from the commonplace into the surprising gravity of the unknown. That gravity is what has created the 'New Bones' EP. The whirlwind of shows they didn\u2019t get to play, festivals that didn\u2019t know their name and a fan base they didn\u2019t see grow into the chorus that it is today. Find Your Worth, Come Home wasn\u2019t given an opportunity to see the light of day, but on it has own it clawed to the surface and made itself known. That sonic territory traversed is what brings us here today. The TSOW quintet know better than to try and replicate 'Find Your Worth, Come Home', with that said, as clich\u00e9 as it has the ability to sound, you should expect something else. Something deeper into the darkness of sound. It\u2019s always cast in this good and evil light, but truly, these are men who don\u2019t shy away from what life is for them, that it\u2019s not all the triumph of rainbows and the padding of God\u2019s abundance. No, that would be too slight an existence, the desire to dive deep into peril and shine through with the goodness of a hope, worth being deemed a hope. As Beethoven wrote unhinging, churning master pieces, feeling his way through the arrangements and Nirvana took you into the soul of men who had nothing but music to articulate the words they had stored inside them. You will be given another look into the soul of a quiet honesty and a resounding passion to the story of the life they have conquered thus far. 'New Bone's is out now on Cardigan Records.

After riding that high, J. Marc decided to step back from the limelight for a while to devote some time to other pursuits and spend time with his family. However, he stayed active in the Country music world. He has been involved in producing, arranging, writing, engineering, promoting and even booking other acts.

But their self-titled debut album in \u201971 went beyond just leather and motorcycles, revealing even more musical layers; sweet three-part harmonies and rootsy, introspective, acoustic flavors. The Doobie Brothers\u2019 legacy has been built upon not just hit records, but also an unrivaled commitment to musical integrity and a steadfast allegiance to their enthusiastic fan base. The bands ability to evolve in a constantly changing industry and connections to generations of listening audiences is a testament to their craft. It all began in 1969, when a drummer named John Hartman arrived in Northern California. He was there to meet Skip Spence from the band Moby Grape and become part of a supposed band reunion that never quite got off the ground. But it wasn\u2019t all for naught. Spence (who had also played in the Jefferson Airplane) introduced Hartman to his friend Tom Johnston, a local singer/songwriter/guitarist -and they connected. Hartman and Johnston began playing local Bay Area bars. They soon met singer/guitarist Pat Simmons, whose finger-style playing richly complimented Johnston\u2019s R&B strumming-style, and the foundation for The Doobie Brothers was set. While their debut album in 1971 did not chart, just a year a later, their second record, Toulouse Street, became a breakout sensation. Producer Ted Templeman helped the band craft a sound that was organic, yet radio friendly, and brought in Little Feat keyboardist Bill Payne to add unique musical textures. From there The Doobies hit the road, tirelessly working their way around the world. They established themselves with a breathtaking run of hits on Warner Bros. Records that tapped into a myriad of American styles. \u201cListen to the Music,\u201d \u201cJesus is Just Alright,\u201d \u201cChina Grove,\u201d \u201cBlack Water,\u201d \u201cRockin\u2019 Down the Highway,\u201d \u201cLong Train Runnin\u2019\u201d and other anthemic singles confirmed their status as fine craftsman who could also rock arenas. In 1974, Steely Dan co-lead guitarist and session legend Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter joined the band as third guitarist, one of many unique and talented players who would revolve in and out of the band over the years. The group\u2019s expanded lineup was augmented in 1975 by Michael McDonald, whose soulful vocals and songwriting led to the hits \u201cWhat a Fool Believes,\u201d \u201cMinute by Minute,\u201d \u201cTakin\u2019 It To The Streets,\u201d and \u201cYou Belong To Me.\u201d Multi-instrumentalist and vocalist, John McFee, joined in 1978 bringing his wide range of musical styles and experience recording with Van Morrison, Steve Miller, Elvis Costello, and The Grateful Dead to The Doobies\u2019 sound. The collaborative, almost communal sense of family within the band allowed them to stay fresh and unpredictable over the years, while never forsaking their deep American musical roots, boogie-jams and all. After a respite in the early 80s, the band reunited in 1987 for a series of gigs benefiting veterans\u2019 groups and children\u2019s charities (ultimately raising millions). Those shows at the Hollywood Bowl were the fastest sell-outs since the Beatles had played there more than 20 years earlier. In a Los Angeles Times poll the year before, fans voted Led Zeppelin and The Doobie Brothers the bands they wanted most to see reunite. Continuing to record, The Doobies released World Gone Crazy in 2010, produced by Ted Templeman, and Southbound on Arista Nashville in 2014. Southbound, produced by David Huff, featured new recordings of the band\u2019s iconic hits, with country music\u2019s biggest stars including Blake Shelton, Zac Brown Band, Brad Paisley, and Toby Keith. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, have won four GRAMMY\u00ae Awards and sold more than 48 million records worldwide (including three multi-platinum, seven platinum, and 14 gold albums). Their 1976 Best of the Doobies has sold more than 12 million copies, earning rare RIAA Diamond status. Their No. 1 gold-certified singles \u201cBlack Water\u201d (1974) and \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d (1979) lead a catalog of hits that includes \u201cListen to the Music,\u201d \u201cJesus Is Just All Right,\u201d \u201cRockin\u2019 Down the Highway,\u201d \u201cLong Train Runnin\u2019,\u201d \u201cChina Grove,\u201d \u201cTake Me In Your Arms,\u201d Takin\u2019 It to the Streets,\u201d \u201cMinute by Minute,\u201d \u201cYou Belong to Me,\u201d and \u201cThe Doctor.\u201d In all, The Doobies have tallied five Top 10 singles and 16 Top 40 hits. \u201cWe\u2019re basically an American band \u2013 we cover a lot of areas,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe cover blues, R&B, country, bluegrass, and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s based on rhythms, rhythm structures, picking, and harmonies. That\u2019s been the signature of the band.\u201d He continues, \u201cYou take Pat, who comes from a folk/blues background, with a lot of picking and stuff like that; he was a big fan of Rev. Gary Davis and Dave Van Ronk. I come from a blues, soul, R&B, and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll background. Then you stick John McFee into that mix. John came from a country background when he started out and was in the country band Southern Pacific. And he is a session musician \u2013 he\u2019s played with everybody from Steve Miller to Van Morrison to Elvis Costello. If it\u2019s got strings, he can play it.\u201d \u201cWe all have the same work ethic,\u201d says multi-instrument virtuoso McFee, self-described as the \u201cnew guy.\u201d \u201cTom, Pat and I are still surging ahead. We\u2019ve stayed together as friends as well as musicians. We are compelled to challenge ourselves. I mean, I love playing the old songs. But when we\u2019re working on new material now, I think we\u2019re coming up with better parts. The band has always been good, so it\u2019s kind of like we\u2019re competing with ourselves. But honestly, we\u2019re playing better than ever.\u201d Simmons notes, \u201cWe didn\u2019t really sit around and think, \u2018Oh, we need this element or that element.\u2019 The music has always been an honest representation of whatever we happen to be working on at the time. We had all been playing music for a long time before we put the band together, and our roots influences are what come out. Those influences always overtake whatever conceptual ideas you might have. It\u2019s always been that way with this band \u2014 you always return to who you really are.\u201d The ability of The Doobie Brothers\u2019 music to connect with the essentials of people\u2019s lives in tuneful, affecting songs has developed an audience that spans generations today. Known for their dynamic live performances, the band plays close to 100 shows a year touring worldwide, delighting concert goers of all ages. Simmons adds, \u201cWe have a hardcore fan base that has handed our music down through the years to their children and their children\u2019s children. Repeatedly, people go to our concerts and come up to us and say, \u2018My dad turned me on to you guys years ago, and I\u2019ve loved you guys all this time, and my kids are listening to you now.\u201d \u201cAnd the songs that people all know, be it \u2018Listen to the Music,\u2019 \u2018Black Water\u2019 or \u2018China Grove,\u2019 are still getting played,\u201d Johnston adds. \u201cAny song that stands the test of time for 40 years or is getting played around the country on a daily basis \u2013 that to me is a testament to the quality of the tunes, and that they have something to say that resonates with people. I\u2019d like to say this band has been relevant \u2013 it\u2019s been relevant musically, it\u2019s been relevant lyrically, and we\u2019ve always put out a high quality of music.\u201d They take none of it for granted. And their music has proven to be relatable for generations since they first came together, which is why they continue to make new music. The fundamental appeal that has drawn listeners to this group for four decades may be best expressed by Simmons: \u201cIn a certain sense, what this band has always had in common with everyone else is the word \u2018hope.\u2019 We hoped we would make some good music, and we hoped there would be some acceptance, and we hoped that things would get better in the world. In that respect, we\u2019re just the same \u2013 we\u2019re still hopeful about the future.\u201d The mere name of the band gives one hope. And it makes you think, it makes you feel and makes you appreciate the efforts of one of America\u2019s most dependable musical outfits.

Air-Rith) it\u2019s a family name. I grew up in a small blue-collar town on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama and have been playing music for as long as I can remember. My passion for music was passed down from generation to generation, but some of my earliest influences came from my dad and my love for artists like John Cougar Mellencamp, Black Hawk and Garth Brooks. After graduating high school, I moved to Atlanta where my brother Sean and I started the power-pop band, Loverush, which was influenced by some of our favorite artists at the time: the Goo Goo Dolls, Greenday and Cheap Trick. The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge. In 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again? However, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God. It started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world. My hope and prayer is that my music would inspire and encourage everyone who hears to do whatever \u201cIt\u201d is; because Sooner or Later whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, is going to \u2013 so let it.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "409 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "Summer 97 ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11018493.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1605727, -86.777368], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative Country, Alternative, Pop Rock, Alternative Rock", "Time": "10:30 PM", "Venue": "Nudie's Honky Tonk", "moreBioInfo": "Summer 97 effortlessly blends nostalgic and new with a sound that summons your favorite memories while causing you to create memories in the moment.

Riley\u2019s success in Southern Gospel began in 2010 when he left his hometown in Oklahoma and began touring with internationally known Tribute Quartet. During the ten years he spent with Tribute, Riley travelled and sang in nearly all 50 states as well as venues in Canada, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Mexico and Africa. He was honored to perform on stages with talents such as Jason Crabb, Russ Taff, the Isaacs, Gaither Vocal Band, CeCe Winans and the Oak Ridge Boys. During that time, Tribute was nominated for multiple GMA Dove Awards including Album and Song of the Year and enjoyed many chart-topping songs, including three #1 songs on the Southern Gospel Music Charts. In 2016, Riley received the Young Artist Award through Singing News Magazine, and, in 2017, he was named Male Vocalist of the Year through the AGM Awards. As tenor for Tribute Quartet, Riley was a part of events such as the National Quartet Convention, Abraham Productions Singing in the Sun, and the Gatlinburg Gathering. They blessed audiences at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove, the Music City Show Cruise, the Singing at Sea Cruise, Silver Dollar City (Branson, MO) and Dollywood (Pigeon Forge, TN). Riley was honored to be nominated 8 years in a row in the Top 10 Tenors in Gospel Music through the Singing News Magazine. In Riley\u2019s words, \u201cI\u2019ve already been blessed so much in my ministry and God has opened many doors for me, yet the greatest blessing of all is to see the thousands of people that have experienced GOD through something I was a part of. I am forever grateful for this opportunity and I am excited to see what lies ahead.\u201d In 2018, Riley felt God\u2019s calling to step out into a different avenue of ministry. He signed as a soloist with Daywind Records and released his first solo album in September of that year \u2013 Welcome to Me. In addition to launching a successful solo career, Riley continues to speak and sing across the country and internationally.

He's a drummer. A guitarist. A pianist. And with albums like 2019's Americana Dreams, he shows the full range of his abilities, mixing a lifelong appreciation for the Beatles' classic pop melodies with the southern-fried sounds of his adopted hometown. Appropriately, Americana Dreams is a sunny record, stocked with reminders to seize the moment, savor the good times, and let go of life's unnecessary burdens. These songs preach the importance of focusing on the things that really matter: love, good people, even better music, and the times we share together. In Nashville, much has changed since Salaway moved to town more than 15 years ago. The skyline looks different. The music scene has exploded. But Salaway, with his recurring Friday afternoon gigs at BB King's \u2014 sometimes performed as a one-man show with loops and effects, and sometimes performed with Salaway on the drums, leading his full band like a younger Don Henley \u2014 has become a citywide staple. His music is rooted in the best parts of the past and filled with contemporary finishes \u2014 a reminder that Nashville, despite its modern makeover, has always been a place anchored by classic songwriting.

It was the key to an entirely different world. His life changed when, as a teen, he secretly rode the school bus to a friend\u2019s house and played the guitar for the first time. From then on, he immersed himself in music, learning guitar and playing every chance he got. He practiced incessantly\u2014so much that his dad finally bought him his own guitar, just to keep him at home. Harris recalls, \u201cI remember at the time feeling like I had found a treasure chest.\u201d Not long after, he attended a bluegrass festival in his hometown of Unicoi, Tennessee. He witnessed the mayor of the town get up and join a band as the drummer, and he was mesmerized by the fact that the mayor was playing the drums at the festival. Soon he was spending every waking moment on a drum kit and volunteering to play at local festivals. Harris further reveals, \u201cWhen I was 16, I would skip school and just play and play. The only thing that kept me in school was my involvement in school sports, which provided the social interaction I needed with other kids, as I was very shy.\u201d As the years went by, Harris pursued a variety of music avenues. In 2009 he travelled to Nashville and auditioned for a local rock band, \u201cThe Showdown,\u201d and landed the gig. That led to spending the next two years on the road, living the rock star life to the fullest until the band broke up in 2012. A friend and Harris decided to open a music store in their hometown, and he started giving drum lessons. During this time, he worked on music for a film production company and wrote jingles for Amway. What Harris really wanted, however, was to return to Nashville and join the Broadway scene of live entertainment. In 2014, he found day work at the legendary honky-tonk \u201cTootsies.\u201d Harris worked his way up from being the greeter at the door handing out flyers to bar-backing. He eventually moved up the ladder further by subbing on drums, and in 2018 he stepped out in front of the drum kit for the first time and sang whenever the lead singer of the band took breaks. Now Harris fronts his own shows and has fans from all over the world. Harris has found inspiration in the powerhouse vocals of Brandon Boyd of Incubus, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Elton John, The Eagles and Chris Stapleton. In 2017, Brett Young and a label representative saw Harris performing on Broadway and were impressed with his talents. This resulted in Harris being offered one of Young\u2019s self-penned songs, \u201cYou Still Got It.\u201d This gesture gave Harris the drive he needed and a moment he will never forget. Harris is busy writing songs such as \u201cWhiskey Revival\u201d and \u201cRedneck of the Woods\u201d and performing around Nashville, sharing the stage with artists like Brett Eldredge, Thomas Rhett, Scotty McCreery and Kid Rock.

Even during the pandemic, TREVOR kept up his #MondayFunday weekly livestream that started 2yrs prior, easily transitioning from his regular club gig to his home and it continues to this day. Artistically, he always leans towards the styles of blues and rock, or as Drum Media in Australia said, \u201ca little bit Muddy Waters and a little bit David Lee Roth\u201d. Maybe not that extreme, but TREVOR will definitely cop to the influences of not only both of them, but also the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Allman Brothers have made indelible marks on his music. Even though there aren\u2019t any 17 minute songs in FINLAY\u2019s repertoire, his guitar solos are tastefully melodic and often syncopated, and always serve the song.

But for Hale, it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s felt lyrically and sonically on-par. That confidence, something most artists never master, can be heard in his upcoming EP release Hand on the Heartland, featuring songs like \u201cI Got the Girl,\u201d \u201cRaising Humans,\u201d and the title track - a collection of tunes encapsulating Hale, both as an artist and person. \u201cI\u2019m a simple, straight-shooting guy. I\u2019m here to sing what I know, and the songs I\u2019ve chosen for the project should give listeners a pretty good idea of who I am.\u201d His choice in name has all the qualities of a star in the making - but the story behind it reads like anything but that of a traditional country artist. \u201cI spent years of my life in a musical partnership that just wasn\u2019t me - and never was - all the while going by my real name. Ironically, I feel more myself as Mendon Hale than I ever have before.\u201d A combination of the two towns (Mendon and Hale) to the east and west of his hometown of Sumner, Missouri, he\u2019s the son of two musically inclined parents - his mother played piano, while his father helped Hale cut his teeth on the guitar at a young age, teaching him some basic chords to get started. \u201cMy mom always leaned more country, and my dad more classic rock - I guess you could say my sound was a bit predestined.\u201d He started writing in high school, and joined a band with some of the guys from his baseball team in college. But it was his musical experience post-college that shaped Hale most, ultimately leading to his career in country music. Though he experienced much success with the group, including extensive international touring (they shared the stage on both headline and supporting tours with Blink-182, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, Goldfinger, and more) and an RIAJ Gold Album (Japan), Hale left the group feeling less than himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I learned about myself. Namely, who I wasn\u2019t. I felt the band had changed me so significantly and\u2026 I had to find my way back to who I truly was.\u201d Set on exploring a path Hale felt confident fell in line with his calling, he recorded and released his first country album in 2020 - a project a long time in the making. The multi-instrumentalist self-produced Gravel Roads and, despite releasing it with little promotion, quickly saw the rewards of returning to a genre he was clearly born to call home. \u201cI had a lot of support from the bootstrap fans we already had, who were so enthusiastic and encouraging, and a few of the streaming platforms showed the project some editorial love. I knew, with that release, I was finally on the right track.\u201d Ever eager to continue his ascent, Hale leveled up when recording his most recent project - enlisting the help of famed producer and longtime friend Marshall Altman (Eric Paslay, Frankie Ballard, Amy Grant). \u201cMarshall brought a lot to the project, as well as my career. I sent him my songs, and he sent me several more from outside writers. I didn\u2019t want to record anything that wasn\u2019t true to who I was. The first song Marshall brought me was \u2018Cheap\u2019 - and within 15 seconds, I knew he understood exactly what I was going for.\u201d From the upbeat, driving \u201cAll the Way to the Bank,\u201d to the patriotic and anthemic \u201cHand on the Heartland,\u201d to the heartstring-pulling \u201cRaising Humans\u201d (due to his love for his dog), his pristine vocals and obvious conviction for the stories he tells lay claim to the fact that Mendon Hale has found his sonic space with this upcoming EP release.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2208 Elliston Pl, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "The Hooten Hallers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8525042.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1514465, -86.804439], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "EXIT/IN", "moreBioInfo": "Columbia, Missouri trio The Hooten Hallers are a high-energy blues-rock band known for hard-traveling and wild live shows, with a seemingly endless tour schedule.

Waking up one morning to the life-altering effects of an unknown virus that attacked his right ear and left his hearing impaired, Settle decided that he would pursue his dream of being a musician while he still had a chance to hear the melodies ring loud.

Armed with his rich baritone voice and impressive guitar skills, whether solo or with his five-piece band, Settle always delivers. When asked what he hopes listeners take away from his music, Settle says, \u201cI want people to understand me through my music, and I want them to feel understood.

Her musical artistry is a reflection of who she is: a fierce, independent, wild, free and untamed spirit. After dedicating her life to music, Bethel has now risen to claim her place at the vanguard of independent singer/songwriters in Nashville\u2019s vibrant music scene. Her music captures the essence of her signature sound by blending elements of the many genres and styles that have influenced her writing and creative expression. Being fearless and unafraid to bare her deepest feelings in her songs is a reflection of her lifestyle, from solo backpacking in the deserts of Arizona and the mystical Joshua Tree, to hiking snow-peaked mountains in Alaska, Bethel lives her life to the fullest. She has experienced deep love, great loss and the healing power of personal growth and redemption \u2013 and she translates those life experiences to listeners though her songs, music videos and live performances. Bethel was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin where as a child she studied dance and appeared in theater performances. She attended elementary school in nearby Oakfield, before moving to Houghton, Michigan where she went to middle and high school. She grew up listening to Country and Seventies Rock music. Drawing on influences from Tom Petty, The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and Willie Nelson, among others, she spent her teenage years traveling the upper Midwest performing at fairs, bars, talent shows, coffee houses, shopping malls and Country Western shows. She self-released her first record at age 17, and the following year she moved to Nashville where she released three more albums over a five year span. Bethel\u2019s career trajectory took a sharp upward turn following the release of her single and music video \u201cTrain\u201d in October, 2018. A deeply personal song, \u201cTrain\u201d was the beginning of a new chapter in her musical career, and one that saw her firmly taking the reins of her musical expression and how it is produced and presented. The visually stunning video, filmed in the mountains of west Texas, premiered at The Boot, and the single made its airwaves debut across multiple genre radio stations, including Lightning 100, Nashville\u2019s long-running independent outlet known for playing groundbreaking Indie Rock and Alt Country music, and on Music City\u2019s WSM Radio, arguably the definitive country music station in America. In quick succession, Bethel and \u201cTrain\u201d were selected as a CMT Music \u201cArtist Discovery\u201d where Bethel and \u201cTrain\u201d were featured across all CMT broadcast, online and social media platforms. Bethel\u2019s next single and music video, \u201cRhinestone Rodeo,\u201d was released in May, 2019. It was premiered online by Billboard, and saw its national television premier on CMT Music in June. Bethel\u2019s 2019 \u201cRhinestone Rodeo Tour\u201d exposed the gypsy songstress to thousands of fans across the country with shows in seven states. From solo acoustic performances at venues like New York City\u2019s famed Rockwood Music Hall, to full band shows at influential spaces including Tidball\u2019s in Bowling Green and The City Winery in Nashville, Bethel mesmerized audiences with her electric live shows and profound connection to her craft. \u201cThe House Is On Fire,\u201d Bethel\u2019s current single and \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d in-studio music video was released in October, 2019. The single was premiered simultaneously by Americana Highways and The Boot and is currently featured on the CMT \u201cNext Women of Country\u201d Spotify playlist. The official music video for the song was given its world premiere in March of 2019 on Ditty TV, a leading Americana music online and broadcast network. It was also showcased on Gretsch Guitars\u2018 blog and debuted on CMT. The song also recently won First Place in the Americana category at the International Songwriting Competition. Bethel tours across America and has opened for many artists across multiple genres, including The Black Lillies, Canaan Smith, Nine Days, Smithfield, The Beach Boys, Trisha Yearwood, and others. Her music has received acclaim from renowned publications including Billboard, The Washington Post, Americana Highways, The Alternate Root, The Boot, Maverick Magazine, and others.

Cycles is a collection of songs encompassing the many ways that we destroy and rebuild as people, as families, and as a country. Songs about the cycle of life inspired by the birth of a nephew and the loss of a grandmother, songs about internal mental cycles of ambition and self-doubt, the cycle of progress and regression in our country\u2019s political journey, and the cycles of growth and reinvention that relationships take on. At times heartbreaking, at times celebratory, the album is a reflection of a lot of life experienced in a relatively short amount of time, a desire to hold fast to the people we love in the wake of so much uncertainty, and an exploration of the immense and unique strength of women in the face of adversity. Originally from Chicago, Baiman moved to Nashville at eighteen, and has spent the last decade working as a musician in a wide variety of roles, from session musician (Molly Tuttle, Kelsey Waldon, Caroline Spence), to live sidewoman (Kacey Musgraves, Amy Ray), to bandmate and producer. Fiddle music was her first love, and she is known in the bluegrass and old time world for her work with progressive acoustic duo 10 String Symphony with fiddle player Christian Sedelmyer. Her first solo album Shame, was produced by Andrew Marlin of Mandolin Orange, and established her role as part of a new generation of political songwriters. Since 2017, Baiman has toured her solo project internationally with appearances at the Kilkenny Roots Festival in Ireland, the Mullum Music Festival in Australia, and the Kennedy Center Millenium Stage in Washington, DC. She has also released a variety of small scale projects; her 2018 Free Dirt EP Thanksgiving, which read as a sort of epilogue to Shame, a duet project with singer Mike Wheeler, which is a more stripped down nod to her acoustic roots, and a 2020 single, Wrong Way Round, which shows more sonic experimentation and hints at musical direction of Cycles. Inspired by the burgeoning grunge rock scene in Melbourne, Cycles was recorded in Australia in the glorified storage unit known as Purple Wayne Studios (Big Smoke) with engineer Alex O\u2019Gorman (Angie McMahon). In addition to Hally on bass, piano and guitar, and Baiman on guitar, strings and banjo, other musicians include Melbourne drummer Bree Hartley, guitar players Cy Winstanley (Brandy Clarke) and Josh Oliver (Mandolin Orange), and guest vocalists Dan Parsons, Dan Watkins and Maggie Rigby (The Maes).

A girl in Star City, Arkansas grows up with loving parents who would flirt and sing in harmony to 1960\u2019s break-up songs by Elvis Presley and Skeeter Davis. Summers were spent with her Mammy and Pappy traveling to bluegrass festivals in their motorhome, the little curly haired girl dancing to the fiddles and banjos, embraced by the tight-knit bluegrass community. Her father\u2019s work takes the family to the bayou of Monroe, Louisiana where the utopia is interrupted when her idyllic home breaks up, rocked by infidelity that nobody saw coming and her world is turned upside down. She retreats to the radio, back to her sad country songs, stories woven around her own pain. In the aftermath, she is determined to split town to make a life is on her own terms. In a head-turning spin, a month after high school graduation, she wins the America\u2019s Miss T.E.E.N. Beauty Pageant where she is scouted by a talent agent. She puts her college plans on hold, moves to New York and in a few short years, this small-town girl is making her Broadway debut in Julie Taymor\u2019s \u201cThe Green Bird.\u201d As if that wasn\u2019t a ripe enough story for a roller coaster of a country song, fast forward a few years, girl meets boy, girl gets married, has children, spinning on stage after stage until her history catches up to her and she\u2019s playing the part her mother originated, blown sideways by cheating. As a newly single mother in Nashville, Tennessee, she turns back to the country and gospel music from her childhood, writing her way to resilience, through the grief, and toward love. With her newest album, \u201cI\u2019m Not Broken,\u201d Sarah Jane Nelson adds her own defiantly triumphant voice to the Americana-Country field. Set in a sonic landscape that recalls the era of artists like Wynonna, Kathy Mattea and Mary Chapin Carpenter, \u201cI\u2019m Not Broken\u201d is an honest breath of fresh air, a deliberate throwback to the days when a fiddle, an acoustic guitar and a rich alto voice could celebrate the fullness of a life hard-fought and hard-won. Pedal steel, fiddle and acoustic guitar opens the record on the title track that lifts to an anthemic chorus that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on commercial country a decade or two ago: \u201cBut I\u2019m not broken, I\u2019m not done I get up more than I\u2019m knocked down Put myself back the way I was found\u201d Moving from ballad to a rocker with a rolling banjo, \u201cReap What You Sow\u201d is a foot-stomping slap to the woman who steals her man \u201cYou can take the laundry, the dishes, the dirty bathroom and the kitchen, oh the grass looks green but there\u2019s something you should know\u201d. She addresses the ghosts of her past with \u201cSins of the Father\u201d and even gives us a beautiful acoustic version of The Backstreet Boys\u2019 \u201cI Want It That Way,\u201d finding the dark intimacy in the 90\u2019s monster hit. This is a singer who fits the clich\u00e9: \u201cshe could sing the phonebook and make it sound good.\u201d In fact, her search for her voice led her from musical theater to Shakespeare to a 2011 acoustic blues-influenced record of standards. But Nashville does a funny thing to artists, makes a singer into a songwriter and by singing their own songs, the songs bring out a truer voice, teaching the artist something maybe they had forgotten. As rich as cane syrup, Nelson\u2019s honeyed voice is both resilient and vulnerable, gliding through the 12 songs with a gentle familiarity, as if we\u2019ve known her all along. It\u2019s clear this once-musical theater actress has deep roots in country music, as every note rings authentic. This is no small task and not many other singers could pull off this hat trick. Nelson had been toying with her songs for years, writing with babies on her lap, moving from NYC to Oregon to Los Angeles and eventually to Nashville with her then-husband, also an actor. But the foundation of her marriage had been crumbling for years and cracked wide open in Nashville. The 12 songs on \u201cI\u2019m Not Broken\u201d are the result of this shift from singing others stories to singing her own. From the title track to the last song, \u201cA Little Bit of Light,\u201d Sarah Jane reveals the universal truths of characters struggling to find hope as the fantasy falls apart. Sarah Jane Nelson is no straightforward theatrical talent, trying on a costume of a genre. These songs come from a decidedly Americana truth: from a single mother hanging onto a dream through unexpected changes, from a singer returning to the land and music of her childhood, from a keenly observant writer telling a universal story born out of her own specifics. And finally, from the twirling little girl in the festival fields to the teenager singing along to vinyl records to the songwriting single mother of two, \u201cI\u2019m Not Broken\u201d is the record Sarah Jane Nelson was born to make.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "816 3rd Ave S, Nashville, TN 37210", "Artist": "The Hardin Draw ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8151393.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1521985, -86.7699021], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "3rd & Lindsley", "moreBioInfo": "\"There are no rules.

Success was hard to maintain, however, and just as the momentum started to slow Brett received a call from the manager of country artist, Matt Stillwell. After a few meetings Brett accepted the job of drummer/tour manager for Matt and moved to Nashville. Since moving to Nashville in 2009, not only has Brett toured the country with Matt, but he has also recorded and/or performed live with many national artists including, Jason Michael Carroll, Joshua Scott Jones (Steel Magnolia), and Mickey Jack Cones (producer/engineer: Jason Aldean, Trace Adkins, etc), just to name a few.

Pulling from a wide variety of influences like Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, and Miley Cyrus among others, her music defies genre boundaries. Her music showcases her authentic Southern roots while also featuring catchy pop melodies and lyrics that dig deep into the truth of the human condition. Growing up a classically trained ballerina, Bonner danced as a senior member of the Academy of Classic Arts in Huntsville, Alabama, and won scholarships to dance with the Eglevsky Ballet in NYC as well as several other prestigious companies. At age twelve, she taught herself to play guitar with the help of YouTube and, after two years, Bonner begged her parents to let her take vocal lessons in Nashville. It was there that she met Bart Herbison, Executive Director of NSAI, who became her biggest champion and connected her with her first co-writers and creative collaborators. Soon thereafter, Bonner realized her true calling to be a singer-songwriter and she never looked back. Bonner left home for Nashville the week after she turned 17 where she continued to co-write and expand her network of industry professionals. During this time, she played multiple shows at The Bluebird Cafe, gained a residency at The Listening Room, and toured the Southeast. In 2014, she teamed up with bluegrass singer-songwriter Katie Mae Smith to form duo Little Honey, and spent the next two years recording and releasing music. They toured all over the southeastern United States, opening for powerhouse performers such as Charlie Daniels, The Band Perry, Mel Tillis, Lee Greenwood, and Shooter Jennings. After the pair decided to go their separate ways in 2016, she embarked on her solo career. Later that year, she performed at The Time Center in New York City by The Oxford Center of Entrepreneurs, where she received the Oxford Center Artist Entrepreneur award for her work. In the following years, Bonner found streaming success with her new releases. She released four songs, including \u201cSomeone New,\u201d \u201cSell Me On California,\u201d \u201cNothing To It,\u201d and her most recent, \u201cIn My Dreams,\u201d which racked up over 91.3k streams on Spotify alone. Bonner spent the majority of the previous year writing exclusively for her upcoming EP, due out later this year. Drawing upon her personal experiences for inspiration, she wrote the majority of the project with producer Izaac Burkhart and, on some songs, another close collaborator. In 2020, she also joined a collective of musicians known as The 615 House, which went viral on TikTok. The group amassed over 1M likes in 12 days and has since grown its follower base to 751.1k on TikTok and 45.6k on Instagram in only eleven months.

Combining a traditional country style with a modern country sound, Paul offers a refreshing voice to country music and its fans. Paul began his musical journey at the early age of three when his father gave him his first drum kit. After years of being involved in the music scene at church, he began playing guitar and along the way decided to try his hand at songwriting. Paul graduated from the University of Louisiana-Monroe (ULM) in 2013, during which he spent time performing with a variety of local bands. Shortly after, in the fall of 2014, Stephen traded the local scene of Louisiana for the streets of Music City to pursue his music career. Stephen Paul has since spent time writing, creating, touring across the country and rapidly growing his fan base. He currently has over 2 million+ streams across all streaming platforms with a 50k social impact. He\u2019s not only found success as an independent country artist, but also as a songwriter. Paul has had several independent cuts, including, \u201cRunnin\u2019 From My Roots,\u201d performed by Janelle Arthur (December 2018). The tune became the title track to the Silver Linings Picture, Runnin\u2019 From My Roots. Known for his relatable lyricism, vocal depth and sincere delivery, Stephen Paul released his breakthrough EP, 'Off My Chest' at the end of 2019.

Growing up he listened to all kinds of music. His parents played in cover bands and thanks to his father, he learned to play drums while he was still very young. Drums came natural to him and he became so good at it that his parents frequently invited him to play with them. Since their bands played all different styles of music, White feels it gave him a great perspective and helped to make him the diverse artist that he is today. \"Although country music has my heart, I still love and respect all kinds of musical expression.\" One thing White never tires of mentioning is the day he heard the music of his musical mentor, Steve Wariner. \u201cPeople talk about defining moments. For me, this was definitely one of them. I heard Steve\u2019s voice and I immediately gravitated toward his tone and phrasing. I knew right then, at the age of fourteen, what I wanted to do with my life.\u201d Fresh out of high school, White says he packed up his guitar, drum sticks, angst, dreams, five hundred dollars that his family gave him and headed to Nashville to pursue a career in country music. The move proved to be beneficial. He charted seventeen singles on Billboard's Country Charts, had six number one singles, two platinum records, two gold records, he joined forces with Shania Twain and together they took \u201cFrom This Moment On\u201d all the way up to number four on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart. He has garnered several awards for himself, including a Grammy, a CMA Horizon Award, and an ACM Top Male Vocalist award among them. And, with his songwriting, he helped several other artists climb the charts; Sawyer Brown and Diamond Rio both made it to the top five slot with songs co-written by White. He's also had song recorded by Wynonna, Joe Diffie, LeAnn Rimes, Lila McCann, Jackie Lee, Love and Theft, just to name a few. The accolades led him to various TV appearances such as \"The Tonight Show,\" \"Late Night With David Letterman,\u201d NBC's \"The Today Show,\" and \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d However, despite all of his musical successes, it is an award from outside of the music arena that is probably the best indicator of who White really is; People Magazine named him one of their \u201c50 most beautiful people\u201d in the world and everyone who knows him finds it easy to understand why. White says he has always been grateful for all he\u2019s been given throughout the years but now looking back in retrospect, he is more grateful than he\u2019s ever been before. \"To gain notoriety for doing something that's second nature has always amazed me,\" he says. \"It's incredible that I've gotten to work with so many of the people who've influenced me. It still blows my mind.\" White took some time off to get away from the craziness of the music business and to start a family. \"After a decade of building my career and being on the road so much, I was spent, mentally and physically,\" he says. \"I knew, I needed to get away and take some time to breathe and do some of the other things I had always dreamed of.\" He did just that by marrying the beautiful actress Erika Page (One Life To Live/Days of Our Lives) and bringing sons Justin and Jackson into the world. When asked how his life has changed during his break from the industry, White responds, \u201cI found my true identity, not only as an artist and a songwriter, but as a human being. I realize now that life is an incredible gift and it\u2019s meant to be lived on purpose and outwardly. Music is a gift and a great vehicle but it\u2019s really about what happens beyond the music for me. What kind of legacy did I leave as a husband, as a father, and a friend?\u201d Bryan is currently working on a new album entitled \"Shine\" scheduled to be released May 27th, 2014.

James released a new album called Songs and Stories on November 22, 2019. Previous releases include Still Country, Still King: A Tribute to George Jones (September 2018), his first full-length original album Relapse (May 2017), and an EP Honky Tonk Land (June 2014). In 2015, James left a technician job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and returned to his native state of Tennessee to pursue a country music career. George Jones' own widow, Nancy, personally hired James for his first steady gig at the George Jones Museum in Nashville, allowing him to make a living playing music and to hone his hobby-turned-profession in an accelerated fashion. Since then, James has played several shows each week in downtown Nashville at places like The George Jones and AJ's Good Time Bar when he's not on the road, having played over 1500 public, corporate, and private events since January 2015. In addition to supporting his young family and connecting with other musicians and songwriters, performing downtown has helped James build a large fan base of folks drawn through the doors by the booming voice echoing down Broadway and 2nd Avenue. Playing so many shows in a relatively short time-frame in a city with an excess of raw talent forced him to sharpen his stage show quickly and continue to refine the thing he's always enjoyed most \u2014 entertaining and interacting with his audiences in a way that leaves most people feeling like they've made a new friend. James was the 2018 WSM Road Show Winner, resulting in the opportunity to make his Grand Ole Opry debut opening for Alan Jackson at the Ryman Auditorium on January 17, 2020. He was also selected by Jackson from the crop of rising artists who play at AJ\u2019s Good Time Bar, Jackson\u2019s self-owned honky-tonk on downtown Nashville\u2019s famed \u201cLower Broadway,\u201d to open select dates on Jackson\u2019s 2019 \u201cHonky Tonk Highway\u201d tour.

He's performed in states such as New York, Ohio, Texas, Missouri, Florida, Arizona, New Mexico and California to even performing for our troops overseas in Japan. Stepping back, after completing his tour of duty as a U.S. Navy Sailor, Kyle decided to pursue playing Country music as his full-time profession. After gaining years of combined live shows, studio recordings and a good size catalog of self-penned songs under his belt, Kyle hit the road for Nashville to make a name for himself in Country Music. \"I love the idea of putting it all on the line and pursuing dreams that most people think are unattainable. It gives me such a rush and fuels my pursuit for success.\" Along the way he has worked with many other Nashville artists and songwriters inspiring him to become \"the whole package\" as a Country artist. \"I love song writing! Being able to write and sing about all the great stories we've all had and the experiences we've been through in a way that deeply connects with a listener is truly magical. Some people say moment to moment is how most people live their lives. I like to think as songwriters, we live our lives song to song.\" From his twangy country voice to his down home traditional country sound, Kyle believes that a guitar, a beer, and a whole lot of that two-stepping music is the simplest equation for a good time. His sound has somewhat been derived from his idols like Garth Brooks and George Strait, to name a few, but his style and music are his own. Kyle Mercer is a taste of that good ol' traditional country music, wrangler wearing cowboy vibe with a fresh modern twist. \"I'm all about REAL country music, and to me that's all about the stories of loving a woman, working hard, and drinking beers with the one's that you love most.\" Currently, Kyle has released and is promoting his first EP titled \"REAL LIFE\" which can be heard and purchased at kylemercermusic.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "925 3rd Ave N, Nashville, TN 37201", "Artist": "Closed ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [36.1732359, -86.78368479999999], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Disco, R&b, Soul", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Brooklyn Bowl Nashville", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2611 McGavock Pike, Nashville, TN 37214", "Artist": "Jacob Bryant ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11102474.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.217732, -86.698216], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Southern Rock, Country", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Nashville's Most Wanted - Acoustic w/Craig Campbell & Cody Purvis & Others", "moreBioInfo": "Growing up in the rural North Georgia mountains down a three mile dirt road, Jacob Bryant picked up his first guitar at eight years old. He was influnced by the Bluegrass music his family played and later on, the southern rock and traditional country music he discovered. As he got older, Jacob began playing in church where he served as leader of the youth group. Family and church jump started his interest in choosing a career in music. The singer/songwriter continued to hone his craft and took his show on the road after graduating high school. But It was New Year\u2019s Day 2010 when his life changed forever. He was driving to Nashville when he got the call about his mom dying and his whole life fell apart throwing him into a long tail spin of depression. Eventually, it was music that brought him back. Behind his blue eyes and charming smile lies a past of hurt, addiction, a divorce and so much more that fueled his songwriting and pushed him to track some of his most popular biographical anthems including \u201cSave My Soul,\u201d \u201cThis Side of Sober,\u201d \u201cPour Whiskey On My Grave\u201d \u201cBest Part Of My Is You\u201d & \u201cSometimes I pray\u201d .

Much like her peers Maggie Rogers and Billie Eilish, she exudes authenticity which the modern generation is desperately craving. Originally from the Western Hills of Northern Virginia, she recently moved to Nashville to pursue music full time. Maggie grew up on the soulful vocals of vintage artists like Stevie Nicks and Ann Wilson, but has found 90s grunge to be a major source of inspiration as of late. She meshes all of her influences together with pounding, anthemic instrumentals to create a sound that\u2019s all her own. In her music, Maggie addresses the conflicts of life through sharp-hitting lyrics textured in alternative rhythms with pop sensibilities that paint a compelling picture of our imperfect existence. The contrast of her jangly sounds and perceptive lyrics are a result of her commitment to connectivity through the honest expression of the human condition.\u202fShe explains, \u201cI make music for the utter reason alone that I need to create something for myself that makes sense, when nothing else around me does.\u201d At an early age, Maggie was exposed to live music from her father, who played in a Celtic rock band. Later on, he became a pastor, leading Maggie to sing in church for her first time at the age of 17. Towards the end of high school, Maggie applied to a Christian music school, but a week before move-in day, she found out her scholarships fell through. As she watched all her friends go away to school, Maggie got a job as a barista at a local coffee shop and began to focus on making music. Soon after, a friend entered Maggie in a raffle contest at a local fair, where she won her first recording session. Not only can Maggie sing, but she also plays the piano, drums, guitar, ukulele, mandolin, banjo, bass, and keytar. She even opts to play a right-handed strat with her left hand. Maggie did not perform for an audience until she was 18, but when she started her solo gigs, she was quickly discovered by Bruce Gates after performing at Pearl Street Warehouse in Washington, DC. It was at this point that she relocated to Nashville and signed to a management and artist development deal with Warehouse West Entertainment. Maggie is represented by Josh Bracken (Loeb & Loeb), as well as Lillian Williams (O\u2019Neil Hagaman) for business management. She\u2019s been featured on Billboard, American Songwriter, and more. Her single \u201cWHATDOISAY?\u201d has been featured on multiple playlists such as Spotify\u2019s New Music Friday, New Music Friday UK, Fresh Finds, Fresh Finds: Pop, Indie Pop, Our Generation, and Study Break.

Gospel, Folk, Classic Country", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Grand Ole Opry House", "moreBioInfo": "The most eagerly-anticipated bluegrass debut in recent memory, Dailey & Vincent area a powerful ensemble steeped in bluegrass and country music traditions, but blessed with the drive, talent, and charisma to assert those timeless values proudly onto today's stage. Even before one note of their stunning debut record had been heard, Jamie Dailey and Darrin Vincent earned a standing ovation at the 2007 International Bluegrass Music Association convention and were booked for more than 100 shows. Now that the album is here, the advance accolades are completely understandable. This is music that can stand side by side with any of the most revered bluegrass discs ever made. Co-leaders Jamie Dailey and Darrin Vincent have already had a profound impact on much of the best modern bluegrass via their contributions to such estimable performers as Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver, Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder, and Rhonda Vincent & The Rage. The decision to join forces was not taken lightly, as they both held comfortable positions within premier bluegrass bands \u2013 Dailey as lead and tenor singer for nine years with Lawson, Vincent as harmony vocalist and multi-instrumentalist with Skaggs. \u201cBut when I first heard Jamie sing,\u201d Darrin Vincent recalls, \u201cit absolutely brought me out of my seat. I said, \u2018That is somebody I need to know.\u2019\u201d Vincent\u2019s initial instincts were confirmed the instant that he and Dailey sang together. \u201cWhen I first heard our voices blend, I said, \u2018There\u2019s something special about that,\u2019\u201d Vincent continues. \u201cIt was like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got to pursue this.\u2019 Then I looked around, and Sonny stopped playing in The Osborne Brothers. Jim [McReynolds] from Jim & Jesse passed away. All of a sudden, there weren\u2019t any duos in bluegrass anymore. I thought, \u2018This is going to be a lost thing if we don\u2019t form a duo.\u2019 It just made sense.\u201d Dailey agrees, adding that when he met Darrin six years ago, he knew immediately that he wanted to take his next professional steps with him. In 2003, the two began talking seriously about becoming a team. \u201cI was happy \u2013 I had no complaints,\u201d says Jamie of his nine years in Quicksilver. \u201cBut I knew probably after being with Doyle three years that eventually I would want to step away, in order for me to fulfill what was in my heart and to get to do everything I wanted to do musically.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been praying about this for about four years,\u201d Darrin comments, \u201cbecause we were making sure that it\u2019s the right choice. He (Jamie) was making really good money and doing great with Doyle. I\u2019ve been having a ball with Ricky. With all the awards that we\u2019ve won and all the wonderful opportunities that have come along with Ricky, it really didn\u2019t make sense to quit.\u201d But in 2004, Darrin and Jamie recorded \u201cBeautiful Star of Bethlehem\u201d as a duet for a bluegrass Christmas compilation album. The response was explosive. \u201cWhen we got the response we did off of \u2018Beautiful Star,\u2019 it was overwhelming,\u201d recalls Jamie. \u201cIt just blew my mind. That\u2019s what brought forward the idea that we needed to do our own thing.\u201d \u201cTheir own thing\u201d positively bursts from the speakers from the first notes of their self-titled Rounder debut, Dailey & Vincent, released in January of 2008. The working-man\u2019s laments \u201cSweet Carrie\u201d and \u201cPoor Boy Workin\u2019 Blues\u201d are vintage-sounding, rapid-fire bluegrass romps. Jamie\u2019s tenor lead vocals on \u201cI Believe\u201d and \u201cTake Me Back and Leave Me There\u201d are high, lonesome bluegrass singing at its purest. Darrin\u2019s upbeat lead vocals on \u201cDon\u2019t You Call My Name,\u201d \u201cCumberland River,\u201d and \u201cMusic of the Mountains\u201d sound steeped in tradition. The harmonies in \u201cRiver of Time\u201d and \u201cPlace on Calvary\u201d will send shivers up the spine of anyone who loves the classic overtones that only great bluegrass voices can produce. \u201cMore than a Name on a Wall\u201d sounds vintage because it is \u2013 the song was a 1989 country hit for The Statler Brothers. And as if to remind us that we are in the presence of classic talents, \u201cMy Savior Walks with Me Today\u201d and the extraordinary performance of Gillian Welch and David Rawling\u2019s \u201cBy the Mark\u201d are performed in traditional, mandolin-guitar, brother-duet fashion. Indeed, their voices blend with an uncanny, almost familial consonance, reflecting the dedication and mutual respect behind their partnership. \u201cI get along with Darrin like family,\u201d Jamie explains. \u201cFor six years, we\u2019ve been working on different projects. But we\u2019ve talked to each other on the phone just about every day all during those six years.\u201d \u201cI threw songs at him, he threw songs at me,\u201d Darrin remembers, looking back at the formative stages of their collaboration. \u201cWe went for timeless things, things we wouldn\u2019t mind singing from now on.\u201d Darrin\u2019s sister, bluegrass star Rhonda Vincent, has her own studio. Darrin asked her if he and Jamie could use it. The exceptional blend of their voices on songs like \u201cBy the Mark\u201d captivated Rhonda and everyone else who heard the sound. Soon they were the most talked about new bluegrass band on the circuit \u2013 well before most fans heard any music at all. Pop pianist and songwriter (and bluegrass fan) Bruce Hornsby observed that \u201cTheir name is on the lips of everyone in the know, as far as I'm concerned.\u201d Like most overnight sensations, however, Dailey and Vincent are two men who have paid their dues many times over. Born December 27, 1969, Darrin Vincent first gained notice as a six-year-old tyke in his family\u2019s band, The Sally Mountain Show, in Missouri. In the 1980s, he was in The Rage, the band led by his celebrated sister Rhonda Vincent. He continues to co-produce her acclaimed albums with her to this day. From 1990 through 1997 he backed John Hartford. In April 1997 he joined Ricky Skaggs\u2019 award-winning band, Kentucky Thunder. He is proficient on guitar, bass, and mandolin and is highly regarded for his harmony-singing talent. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a fish out of water,\u201d says Darrin. \u201cI\u2019ve been behind people my whole life \u2013 my sister, John Hartford, Ricky. I\u2019ve never taken front and center stage. Not even one time. I tell you, when I sang \u2018Cumberland River\u2019 at the IBMA convention, I was scared out of my mind. It was extremely, excruciatingly scary.\u201d Jamie Dailey, on the other hand, is noted as a lead singer. But forming this duo was a big step for him as well. Born June 9, 1975, he was plucked from obscurity by Doyle Lawson to become the tenor lead vocalist in the much-awarded Quicksilver. \u201cPeople would ask me when I was a teenager if I would ever want to do this for a living,\u201d Jamie recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018Absolutely not. I would hate that. I never want to be on the road.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think I wanted to travel. Around that time, when I was 16, I heard Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver. When I heard Doyle for the first time, it changed. I was like, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do.\u2019 And then, in August of 1998, he called.\u201d Having heard of Jamie\u2019s talent, Doyle called to inquire whether the high-singing youngster would like to audition. Jamie graduated instantly from singing in local Tennessee bluegrass groups to playing bass and guitar and singing lead and harmony vocals in one of the most famous bluegrass bands in America. Taking with them the lessons they\u2019ve learned from their former employers, their friends, and their families, Jamie and Darrin produced Dailey & Vincent themselves. With pride, they included on the sessions their band members Jeff Parker (mandolin, harmony vocals) and Joe Dean (banjo, bass vocals). Adam Haynes has since been added on fiddle. The result is twelve brilliant performances from two men who sound born to sing together, delivered with a thrilling blend of clarity, precision, and soul. Jamie Dailey and Darrin Vincent have given their lives to bluegrass, to both the traditions and the possibilities that it offers, and now they\u2019ve made the album of their lives. Is it possible to be both classic and brand new?

A prolific composer and prodigious six-string talent, Di Meola has amassed over 20 albums as a leader while collaborating on a dozen or so others with the likes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia, Jean-Luc Ponty and more. And while his dazzling technique on both acoustic and electric guitars has afforded him regal status among hordes of frettboard aficionados who regularly flock to his concerts, the depth of Di Meola's writing and compositions along with the soulfulness of his guitar expressions, have won him legions of fans worldwide.   A pioneer of blending world music and jazz, going back to early Latin-tinged fusion outings like 1976's Land of the Midnight Sun, 1977's Elegant Gypsy and 1978's Casino, the guitar great has continued to explore the rich influence of flamenco, tango, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African music throughout his long career.   Di Meola\u2019s most recent release, 2013\u2019s \"All Your Life\", was an acoustic tour de force that had him revisiting the music of a seminal influence \u2013 The Beatles. \u201cI really credit the Beatles for the reason why I play guitar,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a major catalyst for me to want to learn music. So their impact was pretty strong.\u201d A virtual one-man show of virtuosity, it features the guitar great interpreting 14 familiar Beatles tunes in the stripped-down setting of strictly acoustic guitar. All the tracks are imbued with the guitarist\u2019s signature flamenco flourishes, intricate arpeggiating and dazzling cross-picking. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the Beatles created most of their records during their heyday, \"All Your Life\" stands as a triumph in the long and illustrious career of a bona fide guitar hero. \u201cI\u2019ve come full circle with this,\u201d says Di Meola. \u201cI started out my life loving the Beatles, and I never stopped, just like a lot of so many other guitarists from my generation. In the middle, we all went into whatever music we pursued in our careers -- fusion, jazz, whatever it might be. We all wanted to further our craft. But when you come back to the Beatles\u2019 music, it\u2019s like; \u201cMan, this stuff is still happening! All of it!\u201d   Di Meola's ongoing fascination with complex rhythmic syncopation combined with provocative lyrical melodies and sophisticated harmony has been at the heart of his music throughout a celebrated career that has earned him critical accolades, three gold albums and more than six million in record sales worldwide. He has been particularly enamored over the past 20 years by the tango music of the late great Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, whose compositions he has interpreted over time, beginning with 1990's Di Meola Plays Piazzolla, continuing to 1993's Heart of the Immigrants, 2002's Flesh on Flesh and right up to 2007's Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar. \"Piazzolla had a profound effect on my development as a musician and as a person,\u201d says Al. \u201cWe became close friends, often communicating by mail. And during the course of this friendship my admiration and desire to learn more about this great man intensified.\u201d A native of New Jersey who still resides in the Garden State along with a home in Miami, Di Meola was born in Jersey City on July 22, 1954. Growing up in Bergenfield with the music of Elvis Presley, The Ventures and The Beatles, he naturally gravitated to guitar as a youngster and by his early teens was already an accomplished player. Attaining such impressive skills at such a young age didn't come easy for Al but rather was the result of focused dedication and intensive periods of woodshedding between his junior and senior years in high school. \u201cI used to practice the guitar eight to ten hours a day,\u201d he told DownBeat. \u201cAnd I was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was going with the guitar.\u201d In 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and by the second semester began playing in a fusion quartet led by keyboardist Barry Miles. A gig tape of that band was later passed on to Chick Corea by a friend of Al's, and in the early part of 1974 the 19-year-old guitarist was tapped to join the fusion super group as a replacement for guitarist Bill Connors. \u201cI was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday afternoon when Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn't believe it. But in 10 minutes I packed some clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in Boston again.\u201d   Following a weekend of rehearsals with Chick, Stanley Clarke and Lenny White, Di Meola made his Return to Forever debut at Carnegie Hall on July 3, 1974, officially launching his career into the stratosphere. \"Playing with Chick in Return To Forever was the first significant step in my development as a player,\u201d says Al. After three landmark recordings with Return To Forever \u2013 1974's Where Have I Known You Before, 1975's Grammy Award winning No Mystery and 1976's Romantic Warrior \u2013 the group disbanded and Al subsequently started up his career as a solo artist. His 1976 debut as a leader, Land of the Midnight Sun, was a blazing showcase of his signature chops and Latin-tinged compositions that featured a stellar cast including drummers Steve Gadd and Lenny White, bassist Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius, keyboardists Jan Hammer, Barry Miles and Chick Corea, and percussionist Mingo Lewis. Over the course of six more albums with Columbia Records \u2013 Elegant Gypsy, Casino, Splendido Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario \u2013 Al established himself as an influential force in contemporary music.   1980 marked the triumph of the acoustic guitar Trio with Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Their debut recording on Columbia Records, Friday Night in San Francisco, became a landmark recording that surpassed the two million mark in sales. The following year, 1981, Di Meola was inducted into Guitar Player\u2019s Gallery of Greats after four consecutive wins as Best Jazz Guitarist in the magazine\u2019s Readers Poll. The three virtuosos in the Trio toured together from 1980 through 1983, releasing the studio album Passion, Grace & Fire in 1982. In 1995, they reunited for a third recording, Guitar Trio, follow by another triumphant world tour. In early 1996, Di Meola formed a new trio with the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and RTF band mate Stanley Clarke called The Rite of Strings. Their self-titled debut was released in 1995. Di Meola subsequently recorded with the likes of opera superstar Luciano Pavarotti, pop stars Paul Simon and Dave Matthews, classical guitarist Manuel Barrueco, Japanese jazz pianist Yutaka Kobayashi and Italian pop star Pino Daniele. Over the course of his career, he has also worked and recorded with Phil Collins, Carlos Santana, Steve Winwood, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Milton Naciemento, Egberto Gismonti, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Jimmy Page, Steve Vai and Frank Zappa.    In 2013 and 2014, Di Meola invited the great Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba to tour with him on some concert appearances which were greeted by fans with great applause. Now in early 2015 Di Meola is working on recording his newest album titled; ELYSIUM, and will be touring North America and Europe with many dates already booked.

Her fondness and flair for music developed early while growing up in Connecticut. Knapp\u2019s dual nature reflects the careers and interests of a close-knit family. Her mother is an Episcopalian priest and her father passed down his love of sports-bred competitiveness, which influenced her tremendously. She works hard to be the very best in everything she does. Recognizing the value of music, both parents started Knapp on a creative path early in life. She remembers engaging in classical violin at only three years old and classical piano at five. \u201cWhen you play the piano as a kid, it encourages you to write, so I wrote songs too.\u201d Knapp recalls. \u201cMy mom also had all her children singing in the choir of her church.\u201d Knapp\u2019s brother was a prominent inspiration in her early music life. He introduced her to a variety of sounds and influences. She credits her brother as being a major reason that she chose music as her life\u2019s passion. \u201cHe was a violin prodigy and creative genius who wrote and produced music,\u201d Knapp said. A shy and introverted young girl who loved video games, Knapp played lacrosse and other sports in high school, but secretly longed for a career in music. She sang in competitive choirs and toured with a national youth choir, which led her to study classical music and opera in college. During a summer in college, Knapp traveled to India to work with an Oscar-winning movie composer. By her senior year, she was writing concertos and directing and arranging for a college co-ed acapella group. In 2016, Knapp decided to take her career to the next level. She moved to Nashville and took a job bartending on Broadway. She quickly began making headway in the music scene by writing songs and composing her own blend of cool, cinematic pop with a dark, intelligent style. Her love of electronic music, pop, jazz and other genres is evident in the material she writes. The sexy and snidely fun of \u201cMr. No Good\u201d and the upbeat, empowering \u201cDon\u2019t Block the Sunshine\u201d showcase her unique sound and incredible range. These originals among others distinguish her from other artists who are chasing the current trend. While some artists like to be predictable and safe, Knapp finds inspiration in just the opposite. She has a fierce energy that is evident in her performances and songwriting. \u201cI think my sound is sort of cinematic dark pop\u2014on the darker side,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIt is fun to write in harmonic minor. It\u2019s exciting. I like being musically melodramatic.\u201d Sometimes from darkness, the strongest beams of light emerge and, once you hear her, you will experience the brilliance of Lia Knapp.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1604 8th Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "HENRY CONLON ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9183641.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1370612, -86.7784958], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk Rock, Americana, Folk, Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Basement", "moreBioInfo": "Henry is a singer songwriter born in New York and raised between Long Island and Vermont.

She\u2019s thirsty for compassion and authenticity. And more than anything, she\u2019s thirsty for anything that sets her soul on fire. Kirstie Kraus carries her thirst in her songwriting, in her live shows, and in her everyday connection with other kindred spirits. Nowhere is her appetite more quenched than on a stage in front of her fans, appropriately named \u201cThirsties\u201d. Her confidence naturally shines under the bright lights, taking concert goers on a well-defined path of self-discovery and bliss. Her writing infuses her own transparent journey with others\u2019 experiences to create sustainable lyrics and catchy melodies. The result is a perfect blend of country, funk, blues, and rock because with Kirstie, there are no boundaries. There\u2019s only the process of \u201cletting go\u201d and letting the song tell you what it wants to be. It will also tell you WHERE it wants to be and for an intuitive deep thinker like Kirstie, that place is Nashville. Three years ago, the Wisconsin native made the move to Music City and having heavily toured the summer before with her Midwest band, Thirsty Jones, Kirstie made the decision to really focus on honing her craft in town. She immediately began demoing out songs for her upcoming full length record and playing established Nashville venues, like the Listening Room Caf\u00e9 and the Bluebird. She also leaned into the production side of her album, gaining great insight from her then producer about arrangements, vocal styling, and mixing. Her first Nashville based single, \u201cDelusional\u201d (2018) fancies a sassy 80s funk groove while 2019\u2019s \u201cGotta Do\u201d pulls in early 2000s Shania vibes. \u201cSilver\u201d, her July 2020 release, possesses the licks of Joan Jett and attitude of Avril Lavigne, proving that she\u2019s not a one lane roadmap. In fact, the roadmap has always been paved with perseverance and unwavering support of her close knit family back home. Her strong Catholic upbringing relayed the importance of a greater plan from early on. Growing up in an industrial, blue collar area instilled hard work, community involvement, and social interaction. The popular powerhouse vocals of Mariah, Celine, Gloria Estefan, and Amy Grant nudged the precocious six year old to declare that she too wanted to be a singer, in the form of a homework drawing. Her mother then enrolled her ambitious daughter into every opportunity and outlet she could find. By 12, she was writing songs and by the age of 15, she had picked up a guitar and joined NSAI, which meant frequent trips to Nashville for the next several years to be mentored by the best in the business. Kirstie did what most successful artists of longevity will tell you to do: she built her fan base and relationships back home AND in Nashville before making the big leap. And now, here she is, proving to the world that if you truly set your mind to something, \u201cYes You Can\u201d do it! Taken from the bridge of her song, \u201cGotta Do\u201d, the words \u201cYes You Can\u201d will also serve as the title to her debut album, looking to drop in 2021. And in prelude to the highly anticipated 11 song record, the world gets to learn just how \u201cthirsty\u201d Kirstie is with her new song of the same name. Written solely for her by a close friend, \u201cThirsty\u201d serves as the \u201cultimate biography of what goes on inside of me when I\u2019m in a relationship\u2014the fear of allowing yourself to actually fall in love and trust somebody.\u201d It\u2019s that vulnerability and drive that draws listeners into Kirstie\u2019s message about being your genuine self and doing what you believe in. \u201cThe way you know you\u2019re on the right path is if you open yourself up and the opportunities just fall into place. You\u2019re doing what you want to do and you\u2019re happy doing it. You just got to keep telling yourself you have everything you need and don\u2019t listen to anybody who tells you differently because everything that you put out in the universe comes back.\u201c \u2013 Kirstie Kraus Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/52AOYp2tdqCd2iUHpa5Pex?si=2SpknjALSJyGh72_uRuqzQ FB: www.facebook.com/kirstiekraus Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/KirstieKrausMusic Insta: www.instagram.com/kirstiekraus Twitter: www.twitter.com/kirstiekraus TOUR: www.bandsintown.com/kirstiekraus www.kirstiekraus.com", "otherInfo": "Tuna Bop Writers Round at Cabana Taps Presents Kirstie Kraus at 8:00pm!\n\nAll things Kirstie\nhttps://linktr.ee/KirstieKraus\n\nMerchandise and meet and greets available at show or online at:\nhttps://kirstiekrausshop.square.site"}, {"Address": "1604 8th Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "Nick Connors ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [36.1370612, -86.7784958], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Basement", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "301 1st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37201", "Artist": "Lainey Wilson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11058557.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1591508, -86.77269], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "CMA Summer Jam", "moreBioInfo": "www.laineywilson.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1604 8th Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "Skribe ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11556705.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1370612, -86.7784958], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative Country, Blues, Acoustic, Alt-country, Garage Rock, Folk, Alternative, Americana, Folk Rock, Garage, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "THE BASEMENT", "moreBioInfo": "Garage folk from the land of pleasant living.", "otherInfo": "Honored to be performing a set at the legendary Basement in Nashville."}, {"Address": "1604 8th Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203", "Artist": "Cates ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [36.1370612, -86.7784958], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Basement", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "300 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37201", "Artist": "Rachel Horter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10312419.jpeg", "Coordinates": [36.1617128, -86.77633329999999], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Ole Red", "moreBioInfo": "Rachel Horter is a singer/songwriter living in Nashville, TN.

Fiercely rooted in the classics, the girl who left her Kentucky home and high school at 16 to take a job at Dollywood has grown into a woman who embraces the genre\u2019s forward progression and is confident in what she wants to say. Lighting a fire with her debut album EVERY LITTLE THING, the PLATINUM-certified history making title track steered a chart-topping trifecta on SiriusXM\u2019s The Highway as \u201cIf My Name Was Whiskey\u201d and \u201cHide The Wine\u201d followed. A loyal advocate of Country music\u2019s legacy and future, it\u2019s no surprise an institution like the Grand Ole Opry has invited her for more than 75 performances since her debut while the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum\u00ae partnered on Unbroken Circle: Exploring Country Music History with Carly Pearce, connecting the genre\u2019s eras.

Drawing on influences ranging from Mississippi Fred McDowell, R.L. Burnside, and the Allman Brothers Band to the African blues of Tinariwen and Bombino, with occasional nods to JJ Cale, Tedeschi and Trucks, and even Randy Newman, the Kudzu Duo redefines the possibilities for what is, at heart, a two-piece blues/rock band. \u201cSometimes people\u2014club owners, booking agents\u2014ask if we make enough sound to fill a room, just the two of us,\u201d Reed says, and laughs. \u201cThat is not a problem.\u201d The singer and songwriter grew up just outside Asheville, North Carolina, playing piano before moving to guitar.

Aurora is a small town along the Ohio river that is 30 miles west of Cincinnati, OH. It is known for its rolling hills, its rural culture and the way it hugs the meandering Ohio river. At a very young age Kristine's parents encouraged her love of both music and a country lifestyle. Like many great singers, Kristine got her start singing hymns in the church choir. Her success as a young child in the church choir prompted her to explore different artistic expressions such as local theatre groups, show choir and musical dramaturgy around the Greater Cincinnati Area. By the time Kristine became a teenager she was the desired performer of the National Anthem at air shows, festivals and other events in the Tri-State area.  Kristine attended Columbia College in Chicago where she studied Music Business and Vocal Performance. While at Columbia she commissioned the band Strange on Display as session players for the recording of her solo album. Kristine was so impressed by the raw talent of the band that she invited them to be her exclusive backing band for live performances. In Strange on Display Kristine found mutual passion and support. She also found her now husband and bass player, Michael Dittmer. Kristine graduated from Columbia with Honors. When tragedy took the life of Kristine's good friend and drummer she and the band decided to take a short break to grieve and later came together and unified as The Skallywags. The Skallywags quickly became a local favorite. The rising popularity of the band led them to move to Nashville, Tennessee. They fell in love with the town of Nashville and have been based out of the city ever since. In 2020 they rebranded; transforming The Skallywags into the solo artist, Kristine Kabbes. While Kristine is recognized as a solo artist, she still utilizes The Skallywags as her backup band during live performances. Kristine keeps busy touring, writing and working on various recording projects. She has shared the stage with many artists including The Cadillac Three, Parmalee, Diamond Rio, Casey James, Clint Black, Wynonna Judd, Lorrie Morgan, Collin Raye and Bret Michaels. When Kristine is not working she spends her time outdoors, hiking with her dog, and spending time with family and close friends. You will always find wine in her refrigerator, boots in her closet and music in her heart. ", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}]
