Town was 30 miles away\u2026 so on a normal day you could find me working outside with the animals or singing my heart out with a karaoke machine in my bedroom.\u201d Hannah\u2019s family has always been musical. On her dad\u2019s side, music ran deep tracing her family heritage all the way back to Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley. And even her dad himself fronted his own band back in the 60\u2019s playing lead guitar and singing everything from country to rock and roll. \u201cI always joke and say that music runs in my DNA, but the older I get, I truly believe it. It\u2019s not really a choice, it is a part of me.\u201d Hannah began her career singing in church. With her dad being a Baptist preacher, she always had the opportunity to get on a stage and perform\u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what she did. \u201cWe had a family band, and my part was to play my red tambourine and sing my heart out,\u201d she laughed, \u201cand I loved every minute of it. I knew that I was meant to be a performer.\u201d Her performing continued as she grew up. Throughout high school you could find her singing at any event at school, performing at local town festivals and participating in talent contests, and even singing the National Anthem for the Dixie National Rodeo in Jackson, MS. But Hannah always knew there was more inside of her than just singing other artist\u2019s music. \u201cI knew there was more to this.. I loved singing all of the classics from Patsy Cline to Loretta Lynn. My favorites to cover were Shania Twain, the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill, and Patty Loveless, but I wanted to sing my songs.\u201d Even though she didn\u2019t have any songs at that point! In 2007, she graduated from high school and headed to college. That\u2019s where her songwriting journey began. \u201cI wrote my first song sitting in a piano practice room at Mississippi College. I had been wanting to write for a long time, but nothing would ever come.\u201d After many prayers and almost giving up, she sat down to the piano and the words flowed. \u201cI was so excited! I had tried for so long, and finally it happened. It lit a fire under me and ignited a passion I always knew was there.\u201d From there, Hannah continued to write and inevitably recorded her first original album titled \u201cChasing Thunder\u201d produced by Ernie Rowell and recorded at Fun House Studios in Nashville, TN. \u201cIt felt so good to put my words out there, and the title \u201cChasing Thunder\u201d was so fitting because it summed up what I was trying to do\u2026 chase a dream of being successful in the music business which is so hard to accomplish, something that might not ever happen.\u201d But success did happen for Hannah! With two more original albums under her belt, \u201cPreacher\u2019s Daughter\u201d and \u201cCatch Her if You Can,\u201d Hannah was chosen as a Country Music Association Emerging Artist from 2013-2017 where she was honored with her very own booth in the Music City Center to meet and greet with fans from all over the world at the CMA Fan Fair X during CMA Fest. On top of that, she was honored with a nomination for \u201cSongwriter of the Year\u201d at the 2017 Nashville Universe Awards. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it sometimes! I\u2019m just a country girl from Red Lick, MS and people are taking notice of my songs, my music\u2026 That\u2019s been my dream for as long as I can remember.\u201d She had also polished her skills as a performer, performing at fairs and festivals in Mississippi and the Southeast Region while sharing the stage with big named artists such as Sawyer Brown, Frankie Ballard, Diamond Rio, Bucky Covington, T Graham Brown, Jo\u2019el Sonnier, Shenandoah, Joe Diffie, and Josh Thompson, just to name a few. And she was able to make another one of her childhood dreams come true by filming several music videos that had much success with one claiming a top 5 spot in the Independent Country Music Association awards and her others being picked up by Great American Country, CMT, and The Country Network. It seemed that everything was falling into place for Hannah and her career, but then tragedy struck her family. \u201cWe were at CMA Fest in June, and I was doing my usual meet and greet with the fans\u2026 that\u2019s when I noticed my dad wasn\u2019t himself.\u201d Having already recovered from major heart surgery months before, Hannah\u2019s dad, Paul, was diagnosed with cancer. \u201cEverything just kind of stopped. He was the driving force behind my success in the industry, and when he got sick, it all came to a screeching halt.\u201d Hannah\u2019s focus turned solely to the wellbeing of her father leaving music by the wayside. After over a year of fighting the terrible disease, the family heard the news that they were longing for\u2026\u201dYour dad is cancer free.\u201d \u201cThankful didn\u2019t even begin to describe the way I felt. Our family had witnessed a true miracle through the healing of my dad.\u201d After overcoming so much, Paul encouraged Hannah to get back in the saddle and continue on her musical journey. She had never stopped writing and had even challenged herself to write more during the times of struggle and heartache. \u201cI felt that writing was a way of releasing what I was feeling. It was a way for me to cope, and I really think some of my best writing came during that time.\u201d That\u2019s when they decided to head back into the studio to make her fourth album. With new original music and a reignited passion, Hannah is ready to take on whatever comes next. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a new beginning for me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next or where I am going from here\u2026 All I know is music is my heart, songwriting is my passion, performing in front of crowd is when I am the happiest, and I am meant to be a part of the country music family.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3501 Jourdan Rd, New Orleans, LA 70126", "Artist": "Grayson Capps ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8753153.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.0023569, -90.0190646], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Rock, Soul, Blues", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Faubourg Beer ", "moreBioInfo": "With \u2018Scarlett Roses,\u2019 Grayson Capps first solo release in six years, the acclaimed Alabama songwriter showcases the kind of understated brilliance that can blossom when creativity is detached from expectation, when songs are truly given the space and time to find their writer.

The band came together when Aaron Wilkinson (acoustic guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Chris Mul\u00e9 (electric guitar, vocals) were marooned in San Francisco after the levee breaches following Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. After a chance encounter with fellow New Orleans evacuees Sam Price (bass, vocals) and Garland Paul (drums, vocals), and with no prospects of getting home any time soon, they figured they\u2019d better cook up something new, and quick! A few days later they had put together a song list, landed a weekly gig at San Francisco\u2019s Boom Boom Room, and settled in to share a little taste of Southern culture with their new West coast neighbors. Their 7-song eponymous debut was recorded in 2006 at famed Record Plant studios in Sausalito, CA, and was received so well that the band decided to make the new group priority number one upon moving back to New Orleans in early 2008. Honey Island Swamp Band's music has been described as \"Bayou Americana\", with timeless songs from Wilkinson & Mul\u00e9, highlighted by Mul\u00e9's searing guitar, Wilkinson's sure-handed mandolin, and 4-part vocal harmonies, all anchored by the powerful groove of Price & Paul's Louisiana stomp rhythm section. The addition of Trevor Brooks on Hammond B-3 organ to the HISB family in 2010 has rounded out the band\u2019s sound, which draws from a variety of influences in the world of roots music, including artists such as Lowell George & Little Feat, The Band, Taj Mahal, Gram Parsons, Jerry Garcia, Johnny Cash, Jimmy Reed, Clarence \u201cGatemouth\u201d Brown, and New Orleans\u2019 own Earl King and Dr. John. In April 2009, the band released its first full-length album \u2013 Wishing Well \u2013 and on the strength of such songs as \"Natural Born Fool\", \"Till the Money's Gone\", and the album's title track, Wishing Well was awarded 2009's \u201cBest Blues Album\u201d by OffBeat Magazine, which also named HISB as 2009\u2019s \u201cBest Emerging Artist\u201d and 2010\u2019s \u201cBest Roots Rock Artist\u201d.

When they tear into some vintage New Orleans funk, there\u2019s no questioning from which city these guys hail. And when those \u2018bones start ripping into Hendrix and Led Zeppelin licks, all stylistic bets are off. Even in a city that doesn\u2019t play by the rules, New Orleans\u2019 Bonerama is something different. They\u2019re not a traditional brass band, but they\u2019ve got brass to spare\u2014even with no trumpets or saxes in sight. They can evoke vintage funk, classic rock and free improvisation in the same set; maybe even the same song. Bonerama has been repeatedly recognized by Rolling Stone, hailed as \u201cthe ultimate in brass balls\u201d (2005) and praised for their \u201c\u2026crushing ensemble riffing,human-feedback shrieks and wah-wah growls\u201d (2007). Bonerama carries the brass-band concept to places unknown; what other brass band could snag an honor for \u201cBest Rock Band\u201d (Big Easy Awards 2007)? As cofounder Mark Mullins puts it, \u201cWe thought we could expand what a New Orleans brass band could do. Bands like Dirty Dozen started the \u2018anything goes\u2019 concept, bringing in the guitars and the drumkit and using the sousaphone like a bass guitar. We thought we could push things a little further.\u201d New Orleans\u2019 fertile club scene was directly responsible for Bonerama getting together.Trombonists Mullins and Craig Klein were both members of Harry Connick\u2019s band, where they\u2019d been since 1990. Both were looking to supplement this gig with something a little less structured. \u201cHarry sets the bar pretty high, and you have to play it the same way every night for everyone to follow.\u201d The big chance came in the summer of \u201998, when Mullins had a weekly residency at Tipitina\u2019s in the French Quarter. The club was then turning weekly slots over to some of the city\u2019s favorite musicians,including Allen Toussaint and Cyril Neville; Mullins got charge of Wednesdays. Word got out one week that he and Klein were staging their trombone super-session and everybody they knew wanted to get involved. \u201cIt seemed that half the trombone players in town showed up,\u201d Klein recalls. \u201cAt the end of the night we had them all onstage, maybe fifteen trombones at once. It sounded like a freight train; a big wall of sound coming right at you.\u201d The players in the lineup all add to Bonerama\u2019s diverse blend: Rick Trolsen was one of the first to answer the call for trombonists at Tipitina\u2019s. A New Jersey native who grew up on hippie communes, he first saw New Orleans when the Navy shipped him there; he soon resolved to get out of the Navy and into music full-time. New Orleans native Steve Suter is a classically-trained player and a former member of the Louisiana Philharmonic. A key member of the early lineup was bass trombone player Brian O\u2019Neill. A few years older than his bandmates, O\u2019Neill had toured with R&B legend Wayne Cochran and his CC Riders. \u201cHe could do all the stuff that you\u2019re not supposed to be able to do on a trombone,\u201d Mullins says. Sousaphone player Matt Perrine adds the bassline to Bonerama\u2019s sound and an additional voice to the songwriting. Matt has played with everyone from the New Orleans\u2019 Nightcrawlers brass band to the alternative rock trio the Tin Men. Guitarist Bert Cotton learned his chops at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, and then came to New Orleans to immerse himself in funk. \u201cHe can fill out the chords harmonically, which is one thing that makes us different from a traditional brass band sound,\u201d Klein says. Currently, drummer Eric Bolivar (who played Latin music in New York before joining Anders Osborne\u2019s band in New Orleans) is tag-teaming with Terence Higgins,legendary drummer of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Along with his jazz connections, Mullins is Bonerama\u2019s resident rock \u2019n\u2019roller: It was Mullins who instigated the offbeat classic-rock covers that have become a band tradition. Edgar Winter\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d was the first nugget to get the treatment and songs by Hendrix, Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and the Allman Brothers Band have since appeared in their set right alongside the funk and jazz-flavored numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something about the guitar and the trombone that are related,\u201d Mullins figures. \u201cYou compare the fretboard to the slide; there\u2019s a lot of similarity there.\u201d Indeed, the sounds Mullins makes by playing through a guitar amp and wah-wah pedal may explain why he\u2019s named Jimi Hendrix as one of his favorite trombonists. \u201cIt\u2019s great to grab people with the rock songs, and then turn them on to some New Orleans music at the same time,\u201d Klein says. The buzz on Bonerama grew with hometown acclaim (with the band winning numerous OffBeat Magazine Awards; and Mullins regularly topping Offbeat\u2019s trombone category), lots of roadwork, and a pair of live albums\u2014the first recorded close to home at the Old Point in Algiers; the second on tour in New York. The Boston Herald called them a \u201cbonehead\u2019s dream\u201d; the Vail (CO) Daily noted that \u201cthe sound is fat and wet; sometimes downright lusty.\u201d As hometown music zine Offbeat put it, \u201cThat nerdy kid in the band room with the trombone just might have the last laugh after all.\u201d Since live performance is what Bonerama is all about, it\u2019s no coincidence that their third album, Bringing It Home, is also their third consecutive live disc. It also testifies to the amount of tightening-up the band\u2019s done in recent years. Joining another stack of Bonerama originals are covers ranging from the Meters and George Porter Jr. to the Beatles (two from the White Album, no less) to Thelonious Monk. And when they take on Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cThe Ocean\u201d \u2013 with trombones doing the familiar backing vocals along with the big guitar riff \u2013 you can practically hear the audience\u2019s jaws dropping. Opening the disc is the high-stepping original \u201cBayou Betty,\u201d which recently got some extra mileage: Bonerama were the house band for the all-star Comic Relief benefit in Las Vegas in November 2006 and played that tune as the likes of Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg took the stage. Another memorable show happened the same month back at Tipitina\u2019s, when the Future of Music Coalition sponsored a night to benefit the New Orleans Musicians\u2019 Clinic. Not only did Bonerama play alongside the likes of Steve Earle, Mike Mills (R.E.M.) and Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine), but also behind Tony Clifton - the international lounge lizard created by Andy Kaufman, making one of his first appearances (courtesy of Bob Zmuda, Kaufman\u2019s partner and Comic Relief founder) since rising from the dead. The band has lately survived some harder times as well. They were dealt a shock in December 2005 when band member Brian O\u2019Neill passed away from a sudden heart attack while playing a solo piano gig. \u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of guy you can replace,\u201d says Mullins. \u201cNobody could do what he could. After dealing with our own grief, we had to face the question of what it meant to us as a band.\u201d Original trombonist Rick Trolsen wound up rejoining the band; so a lot of O\u2019Neill\u2019s spirit \u2013 along with his distinctive parts \u2013 is still present. <PRE></PRE> In case anyone needs more proof, the festive vibe of the new CD gives evidence that the spirit of New Orleans music is still going strong. \u201cThe music came back to town quicker than most anything else did,\u201d notes Mullins. \u201cThings look better now than I thought they ever could after the storm happened, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d ### www.bonerama.net MANAGEMENT Highsteppin\u02bc Productions / Philip Stepanian 617.628.5600 pstep@highsteppinproductions.com BOOKING Blue Mountain Artists / Hugh Southard 704.525.1559 hugh@bluemountainartists.com PUBLICITY Madison House Publicity 303.413.8308 www.madisonhousepublicity.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "500 Canal St #2210, New Orleans, LA 70130", "Artist": "DUKES of Dixieland ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6326891.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.9426876, -90.065991], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Jazz @ Blue Dog", "moreBioInfo": "The DUKES of Dixieland blow New Orleans jazz into the 21st Century, weaving strands of pop, gospel, and country with authentic New Orleans sounds.

They were nominated for a Grammy in 2013 for their second album \u2018The Life and Times Of\u2026\u2019. and, with acclaimed releases such as \u2018Vicennial...\u2019,  \u2018On The Spot\u2019 and \u201cTake Cover\u201d, continue to exemplify their ability to honour their city\u2019s musical traditions while forging their own powerful legacy. Hot 8\u2019s incredible tale, which comes across in their life-affirming music, has also previously featured in Spike Lee\u2019s two New Orleans documentaries, When The Levees Broke and The Creek Don\u2019t Rise, and David Simon\u2019s HBO series Treme (in which the band played themselves), to add to extensive features across the world\u2019s media. Mixing an old school street brass approach with funkier currents and hip hop vocals, Hot 8\u2019s magnificent originals are juxtaposed with fresh versions of Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder, The Specials, Basement Jaxx and of course their anthemic take on Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cSexual Healing\u201d. Hot 8 Brass Band\u2019s rhythms are loose-limbed and hard-hitting, with most tracks featuring a sousaphone prominently. The legendary group have established themselves as a dominant force on New Orleans streets\u2014the band you want to dance behind during a Sunday second-line parade or witness jazz funeral. Brass band-related activities have been a vital part of New Orleans\u2019 African American community life for over a century, serving as an important source of celebration, bonding, strength, pride, and both individual and collective expression. Jazz funerals are among the most curious and well-known New Orleans brass band customs.  As an exercise of the belief in \u201crejoicing at death,\u201d the jazz funeral juxtaposes grief and joy. Slow, sad hymns and dirges are played en route to the cemetery, followed by up-tempo songs and joyous second line dancing in a final procession away from the grave.  The city\u2019s traditional obsession with music, parades, dancing, and the rise of black benevolent organizations, has helped to maintain and support brass band activities and culture. Dozens of benevolent societies and groups known as \u201csocial aid & pleasure clubs\u201d sponsor weekly Sunday parades. Very different from New Orleans\u2019 better known Eurocentric Mardi Gras parades, the black social club events consist of three main parts: divisions of colorfully dressed social club members, one or more brass bands and the second line\u2014a crowd of up to several thousand people who follow and dance alongside the parade throughout its several-hour duration. The free-form second line dance performed by club members and the crowd, both of whom dance with umbrellas and handkerchiefs, is derived from West African processions. The intensity that builds from the constant creative interaction between hot music and improvised dancing often erupts into a euphoric dimension in which a sense of total freedom, equality, limitless power, and a spiritual redefining of earthly reality seem to overtake all of the participants. Many legendary and influential musicians who would migrate from New Orleans by the 1920s and influence the direction of American music\u2014among them King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, and Sidney Bechet\u2014got some of their early training and experience in street parades and funerals.  The story of the Hot 8 Brass Band has been one of tragedy and triumph. Over the years the Hot 8\u2019s ranks have been decimated by the deaths of four original members due to street violence and illness. The devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was a life-altering turning point; during which 80% of New Orleans flooded, untold numbers of inhabitants died, and long-term displacement and misery affected hundreds of thousands\u2014raised real concerns about the survival of the city and its indigenous cultural traditions. After being evacuated, displaced, and scattered across the country, the band regrouped and began touring the United States to encourage and support other displaced Katrina victims and promote New Orleans\u2019 recovery.
