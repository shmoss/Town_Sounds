Together, they keep shattering misconceptions country folks have about punk rockers and vice versa.\" -Bobby More // Stomp and Stammer \"Jenny Don't and The Spurs are a fantastic independent country and western quartet who sing heart wrenching songs about emotional turmoil wit passion and honesty. The quartet's albums will make classic country western fans extremely proud.\" - Jersey Beat Since their inception in 2012, the Spurs have kept a relentless schedule of recording, playing locally, and touring. After nearly 500 live appearances in almost a dozen countries, and with a slew of albums and singles to their name, Jenny Don\u2019t And The Spurs are just getting warmed up. The Spurs were founded one cold, winter\u2019s evening by Jenny and Kelly. Jenny had been fronting her own band, DON\u2019T, for some time, as well as playing the occasional solo acoustic set here and there. Kelly, who had been in a slew of Portland punk bands since the 80\u2019s, and who had spent the previous several years balancing a grueling touring schedule playing drums with the garage rock trio PIERCED ARROWS and bass with Portland punk-rock destroyers P.R.O.B.L.E.M.S., and wanted to switch gears a bit. After the concept of forming a raw, real, and back-to-the-roots country band had taken hold, it wasn\u2019t long before the couple was rehearsing a seminal set of standards by such influential early country crooners and outlaws like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Ernest Tubb, and Hank Sr., as well as a sprinkling of originals. It was only a few weeks later that Kelly\u2019s bandmates Fred and Toody Cole got wind of the developing musical project that was taking form in Jenny and Kelly\u2019s kitchen and decided to call their bluff by giving them an unsolicited support slot on an upcoming show featuring the Cole\u2019s own solo two-piece act. Not having anticipated such a high-profile live appearance as a first live outing, and feeling like the guitar-and-bass-only lineup that the band had started life as was lacking something on the rhythm end of things, they decided to ask their friend Sam Henry to join them on drums. Sam, who in addition to being Jenny\u2019s bandmate in DON\u2019T and sometimes solo-set-collaborator, had already had a long, well respected career as one of Portland\u2019s best drummers, having played with such first-generation punk bands as the Wipers, The Rats and Napalm Beach. After a couple of weeks of practice, the debut live appearance of the band went off without a hitch and the core lineup of Jenny Don\u2019t And The Spurs was born. The trio of Jenny, Kelly, and Sam existed in this form for the first year-an-a-half or so of the band\u2019s existence, playing whatever local venue would take them \u2013 bars, clubs, porches, basements, backyards, and even a bookstore. This worked well for a while, and occasionally the Spurs would enlist talent from a pool of several friends to sit in on lead guitar or lap steel. The addition of a second guitar rounded out the sound of the band to the point where Jenny and Co. decided to make it a permanent part of the band\u2019s lineup. After a couple of false starts and a bit of difficulty finding a fourth member who could commit to the Spur\u2019s sometimes grueling touring schedule, the incredible Christopher March became a member of the family in early 2017. Christopher brought with him a wealth of talent and live gig experience, having spent years playing on the Northwest Country, Rockabilly, and Honky-Tonk circuit. Now, with several West Coast and North American tours, as well as three European tours and hundreds of local shows under their tooled-leather Western belts, the Spurs are gearing up for the release of their third full-length studio album. The Spurs are a musical force to be reckoned with, the intensity and energy of their live set, and dazzling Western outfits handmade by Jenny herself, the band is a must-see for anyone who enjoys spirited garage-infused country music played with sincerity and raw conviction.", "otherInfo": "Jenny Don't And The Spurs \nhttps://www.jennydontandthespurs.com\ncelebrating the release of \"Fire On The Ridge\"\nhttps://fluffandgravy.com/store/jenny-dont-and-the-spurs-fire-on-the-ridge/\n\"Somewhere between Kitty Wells, Wanda Jackson, The Knitters, Dead Moon and Tami Nielsen stands Jenny Don't And The Spurs\"\n- Coachella Valley Weekly"}, {"Address": "701 W 6th St, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Brad Stivers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9144519.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2697646, -97.74985070000001], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:45 AM", "Venue": "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Icehouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "5902 Pace Bend Rd N, Spicewood, TX 78669", "Artist": "Yancy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9009026.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.4671291, -98.00787779999999], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 AM", "Venue": "Highland Lakes Camp & Conference Center", "moreBioInfo": "With over a decade under her belt in creative circles, Yancy\u2019s fingerprints have found their way onto a variety of projects that suggests she has an insatiable appetite to explore, while serving as an ingenious study in contrasts along the way. From her high-energy worship projects for kids and her new adult-focused worship album, Yancy\u2019s musical influence is inspiring the entire family to worship, learn and rejoice in the Lord. Comb through Yancy\u2019s credits and you will find her exploring a variety of projects and genres, including a series of pop/rock releases, a Christmas collection and multiple CD and DVD releases. She has toured with acts like Newsboys, Mute Math and Nichole Nordeman; while on the writing side of the coin, she\u2019s teamed up with Third Day\u2019s Mac Powell, co-penned Avalon\u2019s chart topping \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Go\u201d (off the Grammy nominated Oxygen album) and Jaci Velesquez\u2019s acclaimed \u201cSomething Beautiful,\u201d while still finding the time to compose devotional books for worship leaders and musicians as well as one for her pre-teen audience. She even launched a father/daughter-speaking event with her dad and veteran minister, Jim Wideman. Add in five years as a staff worship leader conducting services for every age group imaginable, and Yancy has literally run the entire gamut of enthusiastic diversification. \u201cI knew from a very young age that God had called me to make music with my life. Although I was very confident of that calling growing up, I couldn\u2019t imagine the amazing journey God has taken me on that would be a part of fulfilling that calling,\u201d reflects Yancy. Her latest project, \u201cRoots For The Journey,\u201d is coming to stores on May 21st via distribution partner Elevate Entertainment. \u201cRoots for the Journey is incredibly different musically from what I\u2019ve done these past few years,\u201d says Yancy about the album. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this music that is unplugged, organic and simple. The songs are all based on scripture and the outcome is a really nice chilled-out worship experience that I know adults are going to really enjoy. There will be a companion app that helps parents teach these scriptures and Biblical truths to their children which will be a cool resource for the family.\u201d Inspired to extend her musical influence to the parents and church leaders her children focused-music has equipped over the years, Yancy\u2019s adult-focused album, \u201cRoots For The Journey\u201d was born out of an organic process that caught her by surprise. Yancy explains, \u201cI started off making this a lullaby CD. Taking key scriptures and truths that I wanted to pass on to my son and make sure he knew and understood the direction and answer these scriptures provide us. As I worked in the studio, I realized that the music was shaping up to be way more than lullabies. Already, when I meet people in my life that are facing big mountains, fears or need answers I\u2019ve been able to use these songs as a way to help strengthen their faith and help them meditate on what God\u2019s Word says. I can\u2019t wait to see how God uses these songs to strengthen the faith of those young and old.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Lead worship for camp."}, {"Address": "206 N C M Allen Pkwy, San Marcos, TX 78666", "Artist": "Dale Watson ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9035186.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.8846349, -97.9360267], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "Ameripolitan", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "San Marcos Plaza Park", "moreBioInfo": "Doing it my way....", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "310 E.

Since 2008, Beth has been playing live and recording her original music with Austin musicians that have an ear for her songwriting ability. Her influences span generations of blues, country, and rock 'n' roll greats that led her to a unique soulful, country-tinged brand of roots rock 'n' roll. With her 2013 release One More Time Again - and debut as Beth Lee & The Breakups - she began honing in and developing her energetic live performances. Her soulful, heart-on-your-sleeve songwriting style evolved to include a sultry, sassy, rock 'n' roll edge. Her last LP, Keep Your Mouth Shut, released in May 2016, garnered positive reviews from independent radio and roots publications, including a #19 rank on the Americana Music Show's year end list and a flattering review from KUTX's Laurie Gallardo, who coined the sound as \"country-fried rock 'n' soul\". It was also listed in Alternate Root Magazine and Third Coast Music Magazine as one of the year's top picks. Beth is releasing a new album February 12th, Waiting on You Tonight. The LP was produced in the Bay Area by Chuck Prophet & The Mission Express drummer Vicente Rodriguez, and features Rodriguez as well as Chuck Prophet guitarist James DePrato, and multi-instrumentalist Julie Wolf. Veering astray from her earlier honky-tonk influenced brand of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, the album promises to be equal parts roots and rock with nods to girl groups and soul music from the sixties.

I feel comfortable with both of those forces in my life at all times,\u201d Keeton Coffman says. \u201cWhen you remove one of them, it feels weird.\u201d Coffman is pacing on his front porch, taking a moment to explain the tension not just that he\u2019s found, but that he needs. \u201cI love these new songs because you can hear the hope in them, but you can feel the weight of the circumstances, too,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you just get dark for the sake of dark, you forget you still have a pulse, and hey, your heart is still pumping for a reason.\u201d The new songs Coffman is referencing make up his latest album, Hard Times, a 10-track feat of triumphant, ragtop-down rock-and-roll. Anchored in Coffman\u2019s natural storytelling and earthy voice, Hard Times is both a reintroduction and a return for an artist who\u2019s pushed through starts and stops, but who\u2019s never been anything but exactly who he is. \u201cI\u2019ve never needed someone\u2019s permission to write,\u201d Coffman says. \u201cI\u2019ve always just thought it\u2019s what I should do.\u201d Growing up in Bryan-College Station, Texas, Coffman found an old Alvarez guitar in his mother\u2019s closet behind stacks of Motown, 70s songwriters, and Tina Turner records. \u201cMy mom showed me three or four chords after I confronted her with the guitar, like, \u2018Why has this been hidden in our house?\u2019\u201d Coffman says with a smile. An elite gymnast en route to becoming a national champion, he carried the guitar with him on long bus rides to competitions, and then west to college at the University of Texas at Austin. When an injury finally ended his athletic career at 20, Coffman immersed himself wholly in music. After graduation, Coffman packed up and moved to Houston, where he first built a following with his band, The 71s. The quartet decided to part ways in 2012, and solo projects including 2016\u2019s Killer Eyes followed, always gaining traction thanks to Coffman\u2019s Springsteen-esque grasp on the beauty only found in grit. Houston Press, Space City Rock, and other outlets noticed. But as projects opened doors, Coffman had to step back, moved by forces out of his control. Diagnosed with Bipolar II and Obsessive-compulsive disorder while still in high school, the diseases reared up and set him down. \u201cYou don\u2019t know why Bipolar pops up when out does\u2013\u2013it just comes out of nowhere, and boom,\u201d Coffman says. \u201cA few years ago, when things got very difficult, I decided, well, I\u2019m not going to stop writing even though I\u2019m not sure if these songs are any good - my analytical skills aren\u2019t what they should be. When I got back to myself, I had these 10 songs.\u201d Hard Times comprises those songs\u2013\u2013and Coffman\u2019s willingness to trust the process. \u201cWhen I just let the notes float around as they want to, I am symptom-free in the midst of all that,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the hard days, the more music I play, the less my mind hurts.\u201d Tracks including \u201cThe Magician\u201d and \u201cNight\u201d tackle deception carried out by different actors to different ends, while songs such as \u201cIn the End,\u201d \u201cRiver Town,\u201d and \u201cWounded Heart\u201d explore faith, consistency, and love. Vivid details form multi-dimensional character sketches moving through recognizable Texas skylines, and the guitar-wrapped stories and confessions become our own. \u201cI hope people find themselves in the characters,\u201d Coffman says. \u201cThis is a record I wrote from my experiences, but these aren\u2019t stories about me. I hope these characters share your story, your thoughts, your pain. We can share the same hope\u2013\u2013that\u2019s what music does for me.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2008 Congress Ave S, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "The Basil Trio ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8692819.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.243677, -97.75225929999999], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "C-boy's Heart & Soul", "moreBioInfo": "The Basil Trio is a swingin' organ trio based in Austin Texas.

Produced by Grammy-winning artist, MichaelRamos (John Mellencamp, Paul Simon, Patty Griffin, etc.), the group is perfectly framed by a who\u2019s who of today\u2019s modern music legends.\n\nThe first singles: \u201cKansas\u201d, \u201cRescued\u201d, and \u201cTiger\u201d are crystal clear examples of the chemistry these three writers share. In these songs \u2013 and the record as a whole \u2013 they explore themes of personal, social and political division; rebelling against societal expectations; and leaving behind confining expectations of family and small hometowns. They ruminate on the challenges of finding one\u2019s path in the world, being on the verge of making really bad decisions in the face of mounting stress, mourning the end of something good, being unsure of the legacy of our collective histories... and also letting loose and having some fun!

A punchy, melodic shot of guitar-driven rock & roll and plainspoken Texas country, it\u2019s a promising first step but in another way a culmination of Cannon\u2019s musical journey. Growing up in the coastal Texas town of Kingsville, Cannon soaked up the influence of his parents\u2019 diverse record collection for as long as he could remember, everything from dancehall-friendly classic country to platinum-selling rockers like The Eagles and the Steve Miller Band to the pop-punk and hard rock he picked up on once he was old enough to seek out his own records. Trips to Corpus Christi\u2019s Executive Surf Club venue not only broadened his horizons but also put music closer to his heart; not only were new favorites like Roger Creager and Phil Pritchett making music he could relate to, they were also life-sized examples of how a local guy with guts, talent and creativity could succeed as independent, label-defying young artists. He spent most of the next several years with a guitar in hand, developing enviable rhythm and lead chops and learning to write colorful, catchy original songs. Soon backyard jams for friends and family turned into open mic appearances, and open mics translated into booking gigs as he spent time in the Brazos Valley and the Hill Country, befriending and sharing stages with artists including Pritchett, Little Brave, Zack Walther, Mike Ethan Messick, and Ben Morris & The Great American Chorus. He became a regular at venues in San Marcos, New Braunfels, Bryan, and College Station, occasionally finding his way into bigger markets in Austin and Houston and even fulfilling one early wish to play at the Executive Surf Club for himself. As his talent - and the buzz about it - grew, Cannon was able to pull together the resources to not only make an album but make a bold, tuneful statement with the help of respected musicians like David Grissom, Bukka Allen, Allan Goodman, Matt Briggs and producer Pat Manske. Artists that had lent their talents to some of the greatest recordings in the history of Tyler Cannon\u2019s beloved Texas music were now helping him realize his first milestone. Fresh and energetic, with the confidence of several years already in his back pocket, he\u2019s ready for bigger stages and bolder steps in his promising new career.

For the last two decades, she\u2019s played bass and sung with some of the biggest artists in the Americana genre: Hayes Carll, John Moreland, Eliza Gilkyson, Sunny Sweeney, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and Butch Hancock, to name a few. She\u2019s also maintained a weekly residency at the legendary Continental Club Gallery in Austin, where she lives. Her 2016 release F*** With Sad Girls turned heads, but with Last Will and Testament, Whitmore has turned a corner in her own artistry that may just catapult her to the top of the Americana heap. As someone who\u2019s never shied away from the issues, she\u2019s not afraid to be direct. Her record is full of topical songs, tackling suicide, rape culture, loss, and the great American divide. It\u2019s not easy to talk about heavy subjects without weighing the music down, but Whitmore pulls it off without difficulty. It\u2019s like she\u2019s used to talking about serious matters in casual conversation \u2014 which she is. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely been told to shut up and sing,\u201d she says, referencing the phrase that became commonplace after it was directed at The Chicks. In such divided times, many artists have become hesitant to share their opinions for fear of being ostracized or losing fans. But Bonnie took \u201cshut up and sing\u201d literally. \u201cI thought, fine, I\u2019m just going to sing what I want to talk about.\u201d \u201cMy goal for this record is to inspire people to have hard conversations,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut I definitely subscribe to writing pop music, with catchy lyrics and repeating phrases.\u201d The depth and candor of the record conveyed through Whitmore\u2019s pop sensibilities make it a pure pleasure to listen to. Instead of telling you how it is, she often poses questions in her songs. \u201cWho do you want to be?\u201d she asks in the song \u201cRight/Wrong.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of liberty in the land of the free, without you and me?\u201d It feels like a Tom Petty anthem, and, not unlike Petty\u2019s writing, carries a message of justice and true patriotism beneath an all-American jangle of guitars. \u201cNone of My Business\u201d was written after the 2015 terror attacks in Paris. Whitmore\u2019s gorgeous vibrato is the star on this lush, vibey track. \u201cDay in and day out, all we really do is scream and shout, missing what it\u2019s really all about. Instead of melody, let\u2019s find the harmony, love forwardly, don\u2019t let our fears defend us.\u201d She wrote the title track, \u201cLast Will and Testament,\u201d after losing yet another member of the music community to suicide. \u201cAsked for It\u201d uses a punk rock attitude and driving rhythm to get the listener take a hard look at the nature of rape culture. \u201cSo go on and blame the victim. Why should violence have consequence? And each time you silence them, recreates the same event. She\u2019s the kind of girl you said asked for it.\u201d Her intention is never to preach, but rather to have her songs inspire discussion and reflection. \u201cI\u2019ve always had the drive to participate and use my voice. I feel it is our responsibility to use our voices to challenge authorities if we want to make things better,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a resurgence of the \u201960s civil rights movement, and it is so inspirational right now to see so many people willing to protest things that are wrong, to live up to what we stand for, which is equality for all.\u201d The album isn\u2019t all topical, though; it gets personal too. \u201cFine,\u201d a track clearly destined to be a radio favorite, is an upbeat country rocker about the cycles of relationships, co-written with rising star Jaimee Harris. \u201cLove Worth Remembering\u201d is about the meaning of unconditional love, set to a throwback \u201960s R&B feel. And \u201cGeorge\u2019s Lullaby\u201d is a beautiful tribute to her friend and mentor, bassist George Reiff, who recently passed. Bonnie grew up steeped in music and flanked by strong women. She toured in a band with her parents, Alex and Marti, and older sister Eleanor (now one-half of alt-country outfit the Mastersons with husband Chris Masterson) from an early age. A professional pilot, Alex Whitmore would fly the family to gigs at remote Texas bars and crowded festivals. Fun fact: Bonnie is a licensed pilot as well. Bonnie\u2019s mother has been a big influence on her. Marti is not only a classically trained opera singer, (\u201can actual diva,\u201d says Bonnie, \u201cand with that, there\u2019s real power \u2014 as a soprano, she could overpower a whole choir\u201d), but has also always been very outspoken, and that rubbed off on Bonnie too. Whitmore never thought of \u201cfeminism\u201d as a bad word. Whitmore co-produced the record with Scott Davis, who also co-wrote one of the album\u2019s standout tracks, \u201cRight/Wrong\u201d. They recorded at Ramble Creek Studio in Austin with engineer Britton Biesenherz. Craig Bagby (drums), Trevor Nealon (keys), and BettySoo (backing vocals, accordion), all members of Whitmore\u2019s band the Sad Girls, are fixtures throughout the record. Whitmore has spent the last few years polishing these songs on the road opening for James McMurtry. \u201cBonnie\u2019s been first call support on my tours for a while now, because she kicks ass consistently,\u201d says McMurtry, \u201cSometimes I forget who\u2019s opening and wander back into the venue after I eat, thinking, \u201cDamn, chick can sing, opening band sounds like money, oh . . .\u201d He first asked her to open a tour for him a few years ago, after hearing her sing \u201cF*** With Sad Girls\u201d at the Continental Club Gallery. She\u2019s a songwriter\u2019s songwriter, and a musician\u2019s musician, a fact made evident by artists like McMurtry wanting her as an opener, and artists like Hayes Carll wanting her in their bands. When the Austin-American Statesman\u2019s music critic Peter Blackstock received an advance copy of Last Will and Testament he named Whitmore Austin360\u2019s June Artist of the Month. \u201cWhitmore still enjoys the supporting role,\u201d he notes, \u201cbut these days, she has too much to say to stay in the shadows.\u201d", "otherInfo": "This Week with Jaimee Harris!"}, {"Address": "11500B Rock Rose Ave, Austin, TX 78758", "Artist": "JD Casper ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11363127.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.4012239, -97.7229163], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Alternative, Americana, Rock, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Jack & Ginger's", "moreBioInfo": "www.jdcasper.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2906 Fruth St, Austin, TX 78705", "Artist": "Ramzel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11289755.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2953157, -97.74205219999999], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "Post Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Spiderhouse Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Ramzel is a band from Austin, Texas fronted by singer-songwriter Ryan Fraissinet.

Fraissinet sought to record the next album with a full band, and recruited Aaron Zachary on guitar, Austin Ondrusek on bass, Nelson Laflin on drums, and Mason Parva on keys.

He spent his early years moving from one small town to the next and picked up the guitar at age16, in an effort to mend his first broken heart. Graham finished high school in Wichita Falls, TX and attended Hendrix College, Arkansas, in pursuit of a fine arts and music degree. He decided to take a needed break before graduation and traveled to the Greek islands of Mykonos and Paros located in the Agean Sea where he worked at a diesel jet-engine power plant, mingled among the locals and played his music in the streets. After gaining the life experiences desired, he completed his degree in 2002. He then set out upon another quest and traveled half way around the world to the Micronesian island of Pohnpel, where he volunteered as an English teacher in the local Jesuit school. While overseas, his older brother and best friend Aaron Robert Wilkinson passed away in New York City. By far, his brother\u2019s death was the most difficult thing his family and he have faced. His brothers influence is easily identified in many of Graham\u2019 songs .You see, Aaron was singing and writing in lower east side coffee shops, on the cusp of the Anti-folk scene. Hanging out with the soon to be recognized Regina Spektor, Kimya Dawson, Adam Green from the Moldy Peaches and the guys from The Strokes. The Strokes went on to dedicate their second album \u201cRoom on Fire\u201d to Aaron and all of these musicians continue to make appearances at the Annual Memorial concert held in NYC every July. Aaron\u2019s death lead Graham back to the \u201cstates\u201d. \u201cHad Aaron not passed away, I may never have returned from my volunteer work on Pohnpel\u201d, he stated. It was truly a crossroad in his journey, as he immediately knew upon returning to Texas that he had to move to Austin to make \u201chis music\u201d. The first few years in Austin allowed Graham the opportunities to broaden his musical horizons from leading a punk rock outfit to collaborating on an old-time/bluegrass quintet. Unable to be pinned to one genre, Graham began developing a lineup of interchangeable artists known as the Underground Township. Graham has now found the sound he has been searching for with the current Underground Township lineup and it\u2019s reflective on his new album \u201cYEARBOOK\u201d. It\u2019s been well received by leading Austin radio stations KUT and KGSR and 12 other stations through out the country. \u201cYEARBOOK\u201d features such artists as Alejandro Escovedo (No Depression magazine Artist of the Decade), Hayes Carll (Top played Americana Record of 2009), and Lloyd Maines (Multi-Grammy winning producer/and father of Natalie Maines). The depth of his influences and breadth of his worldly experiences, are unmistakable in this diverse collection of heart thumping tunes. From ska to folk, honky-tonk to rock, his lyrics tackle such lofty and often neglected topics as social responsibility and justice, political corruption and greed while consoling the audience with pithy love songs and pure \u2018feel good\u2019 rhythms and melodies. Though seen as the debut of this young songwriter one must know this is not all we will hear and see from Graham, but rather an incredible step towards a successful musical journey.", "otherInfo": "Join Graham & the band for their first full band show at the Saxon in almost two years!

Late night writing sessions soaked in whiskey gave the group a sound all their own. Cara\u2019s melodies range from hauntingly beautiful to wildly soulful. Blended with Lee\u2019s foot-stomping rhythms and gravelly vocals, the two take the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d standard to heart. The duo spent their first year as a band and as a couple writing tunes and playing shows, often using old books and a hat containing lines of poetry as inspiration. They wanted to build each song as its own story in a greater collection of real-life events. Each song\u2019s characters are vividly constructed and personal, allowing for the listener to relate. Bassist/guitarist/vocalist Casey Kuznieski joined in the summer of 2012, bringing a new level of levity and technical skill to the table. His wide range of talents allowed the band to expand on stage, where any member could potentially play any instrument. But the music still called for more, and so an exhaustive search for the perfect fourth member led the band to accomplished drummer/vocalist Adrian Voorhies, who fell into the mix with great success. After recording the debut album, \"Nightery,\" in April 2015, the Stiffs garnered wide attention from all over the United States, getting airplay from coast to coast as well as Europe, high praise on music blogs, and awards.

Her new album draws comparisons to Patty Griffin, Ryan Adams, and Kathleen Edwards \u2013 all writers who know how to craft a heartbreakingly beautiful song with just enough grit to keep you enthralled. Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable. \"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\" Harris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them. \u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d Harris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d Jaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night. Harris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart. \u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d Once she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors. \u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record. Harris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d \u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie.

With a love of music and skateboarding, Lindell formed a few punky garage bands early on while his musical horizons expanded. He listened to the deep blues of Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Jimmy Reed and Albert King before drifting toward the R&B sounds of The Impressions, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway, soaking up the soul and learning how to craft a song. After performing at bars on the West Coast with a few short-lived bands, Eric formed his own group in 1993. He quickly gained a loyal Northern California audience thanks to countless performances and many late-night jam sessions. Established stars like Charlie Musselwhite and Tom Waits attended his shows, as did overflow crowds of music fans. With music on his mind, Lindell headed to New Orleans in 1999, where he quickly discovered the pulsating and dynamic roots scene. He gravitated toward the West Bank dive bars of Gretna and Algiers, where he befriended many older area musicians who helped him get regular work as a performer. Some of New Orleans' finest players, including keyboardist Ivan Neville and drummers Harold Brown (War), Stanton Moore (Galactic) and Johnny Vidacovich (Professor Longhair, Astral Project) often joined him on stage. Galactic bassist Rob Mercurio began sitting in as well, and word of Lindell's immense talents quickly spread around the city. Stars like Branford Marsalis, The Neville Brothers and John Scofield began showing up at his gigs and embracing this fresh California kid's funky music. According to Lindell, \"It's a great feeling to be recognized for your music in New Orleans.\" Since 2003, in addition to his own gigs, Lindell regularly joins forces with Ivan Neville, Moore and Mercurio (when time and schedules permit) and they perform to overflow crowds as Dragon Smoke. 2006's Change In The Weather delighted and surprised music fans hungry for a truly original artist. Lindell's deceptively simple sounding songs, laid back grooves and hook-laden melodies were fueled by guests including Brown, Neville and Moore. Critics across the country went wild, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same. 2007's Low On Cash, Rich In Love and 2009's Gulf Coast Highway pushed Lindell farther into the spotlight. Appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and National Public Radio's Mountain Stage solidified his stature as an artist who simply could not be ignored. Many of his songs have appeared in films and television shows, including Boston Legal and Treme. He has collaborated and shared stages with blues and rock luminaries, including John Fogerty, Luther Dickinson and Anson Funderburgh. With Revolution In Your Heart, Lindell was more than ready to come home to Alligator. \"The timing is perfect. I'm so excited to get back to focusing on what I do and have such a great team behind me,\" he says. Upon release of the album, Lindell and his band will tour heavily, reuniting with old friends and, as always, earning new fans at every stop. AllMusic declares Lindell a singular talent, saying, \"He plays soulful, funk-drenched, tight and focused grooves. He is a quadruple threat as a solid songwriter, impressive guitarist, affecting singer and harmonica blower. This is music that's deceptively difficult to create. Lindell makes it seem not just easy, but natural.\"", "otherInfo": "Stanton Moore , Robert Mercurio, Ivan Neville, Eric Lindell"}, {"Address": "2538 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78705", "Artist": "Bryce Clifford & Brother Superior ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11556976.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2900705, -97.74177639999999], "Date": "2021-07-29", "EventDate": "Jul. 29th, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Alt-americana, Post-americana, Pop Rock, Americana Rock, Post Punk, Rock, American Rock, Alt Rock", "Time": "9:30 PM", "Venue": "Hole In the Wall", "moreBioInfo": "\"Heavy hitting band with rueful and acerbic lyrics and bar room scarred vocals.\u201d NOW Magazine, Toronto Brother Superior put the song back at the center of rock and roll.

Born and raised in Sedona, The Watters developed their eclectic sound after living in several dramatically different cities including Los Angeles, Denver, Nashville and now Austin. Seamlessly blending Americana, Soul, Rock and Jazz, they have been described as \u201cFleetwood Mac with a horn section.\u201d Daniel and Jenna Watters have collaborated on seven albums together under various monikers, and they released their debut record, GREAT UNKNOWN, as \u201cThey Watters\u201d in 2016. They have garnered a devoted fan base through their energetic performances, stirring vocals and road-weathered musicianship. For The Watters, life and music are one, their journey together being their greatest muse. With fifteen years of music collaboration together, husband and wife duo Daniel & Jenna Watters embrace a sound they call \u201cAmericana Soul\u201d. Aided by some of Austin\u2019s finest musicians, The Watters is full of the rich experience and expert contributions of everyone involved. Lively horn riffs and lingering vocal melodies serve as a cornerstone for the new album, which features well-crafted songwriting, the electric energy of a live performance and unique genre that is both indefinably new yet always familiar. The Watters became an Austin band in 2015. \u201cOn one of our trips home to Sedona,\u201d says Daniel, \u201cwe were convinced to take a long detour to Austin, TX and ended up at a show at The Continental Club Gallery where we decided that night we had to move here.\u201d Now, after recording two albums and playing relentlessly around Austin for five years, The Watters, whose airtight version of Americana/Soul often elicits comparisons to Fleetwood Mac (to whom they\u2019ve been known to play Tribute shows around ATX), Tedeschi Trucks Band, and Rilo Kiley, have won a major grant from local music non-profit Blackfret and are preparing to release their new album Intuition on January 23rd, 2021. Intuition\u2019s primary genre is heavy and/or profound lyrics delivered with buoyancy and amusement. Horns and organs trill around sharp corners. Perfectly executed harmonies and immaculate vocals envelop the tracks in a warmth that often belies the lyrical content. That duality is life, if you\u2019re lucky, and it\u2019s what The Watters excel at. Intuition was recorded live over five days at Good Danny\u2019s Studio (Sheerwater, Wye Oak, Of Montreal) in Lockhart, TX in October 2019. It features JJ Johnson (Tedeschi Trucks Band) on drums, Anthony Farrell (Greyhounds) on Organ, Trevor Nealon (Band of Heathens) on Keys, and Joe Beckham on Bass. Horns and vocals were overdubbed at Birdhouse Studios and background vocals were recorded during Covid-19 lockdown.

Summer 2013, she flew out to Nashville to write and record her first EP with Keith Follese (Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, Faith Hill), Adrienne Follese, and Liz Rose (Taylor Swift). The EP, \u201cMaybe More,\u201d is the result of taking her personal stories and writing experience and adding in some of the top songwriters and producers in the business. A few years after creating \u201cMaybe More\u201d and the EP landing multiple nominations for the Hollywood Music and Media Awards and various other competitions, more stars aligned and after several trips back and forth from Nashville and many hours writing and recording, she finished her first full album, which includes the songs off of the \u201cMaybe More\u201d EP as well as seven new songs created with the help of the incredible Jeff Pardo (Lady Antebellum, Matthew West, Colton Dixon). Since its release, the album has received great reviews and has also received numerous award nominations.

A punchy, melodic shot of guitar-driven rock & roll and plainspoken Texas country, it\u2019s a promising first step but in another way a culmination of Cannon\u2019s musical journey. Growing up in the coastal Texas town of Kingsville, Cannon soaked up the influence of his parents\u2019 diverse record collection for as long as he could remember, everything from dancehall-friendly classic country to platinum-selling rockers like The Eagles and the Steve Miller Band to the pop-punk and hard rock he picked up on once he was old enough to seek out his own records. Trips to Corpus Christi\u2019s Executive Surf Club venue not only broadened his horizons but also put music closer to his heart; not only were new favorites like Roger Creager and Phil Pritchett making music he could relate to, they were also life-sized examples of how a local guy with guts, talent and creativity could succeed as independent, label-defying young artists. He spent most of the next several years with a guitar in hand, developing enviable rhythm and lead chops and learning to write colorful, catchy original songs. Soon backyard jams for friends and family turned into open mic appearances, and open mics translated into booking gigs as he spent time in the Brazos Valley and the Hill Country, befriending and sharing stages with artists including Pritchett, Little Brave, Zack Walther, Mike Ethan Messick, and Ben Morris & The Great American Chorus. He became a regular at venues in San Marcos, New Braunfels, Bryan, and College Station, occasionally finding his way into bigger markets in Austin and Houston and even fulfilling one early wish to play at the Executive Surf Club for himself. As his talent - and the buzz about it - grew, Cannon was able to pull together the resources to not only make an album but make a bold, tuneful statement with the help of respected musicians like David Grissom, Bukka Allen, Allan Goodman, Matt Briggs and producer Pat Manske. Artists that had lent their talents to some of the greatest recordings in the history of Tyler Cannon\u2019s beloved Texas music were now helping him realize his first milestone. Fresh and energetic, with the confidence of several years already in his back pocket, he\u2019s ready for bigger stages and bolder steps in his promising new career.

Since 2008, Beth has been playing live and recording her original music with Austin musicians that have an ear for her songwriting ability. Her influences span generations of blues, country, and rock 'n' roll greats that led her to a unique soulful, country-tinged brand of roots rock 'n' roll. With her 2013 release One More Time Again - and debut as Beth Lee & The Breakups - she began honing in and developing her energetic live performances. Her soulful, heart-on-your-sleeve songwriting style evolved to include a sultry, sassy, rock 'n' roll edge. Her last LP, Keep Your Mouth Shut, released in May 2016, garnered positive reviews from independent radio and roots publications, including a #19 rank on the Americana Music Show's year end list and a flattering review from KUTX's Laurie Gallardo, who coined the sound as \"country-fried rock 'n' soul\". It was also listed in Alternate Root Magazine and Third Coast Music Magazine as one of the year's top picks. Beth is releasing a new album February 12th, Waiting on You Tonight.

He was instantly captivated and knew his next move. He began devouring Tejano music, one of the soundtracks of his birthplace San Marcos, Texas. He began writing and recording Tejano-inspired music, and naturally began playing shows. Rounding up old friends, he quickly had a band: blazing accordion, shimmering keys, cranked guitars, upright bass and drums. The sound he created is traditional Tejano sung in English. Every song is a dance track, and every show is a party focused on friends, family, and bringing the two together. David is no stranger to the stage, he took his previous bands Sons of Fathers and Blue Healer from The Grand Ole Opry to Bonnaroo, from Gruene Hall to Austin City Limits, all while fronting the group from the upright bass.

In college, Manzy was introduced to the sounds of The Band, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Tom Petty, and Jason Boland. Inspired, he picked up a guitar and soon began playing, writing, and performing. Manzy is now known for his original ballads that are rough around the edges and dusty like an old book left on the shelf. His stories can paint pictures that transport your mind to a particular place in time. Manzy's compositions are unique and authentic even if that means going against popular demand. The result: a sound that you didn't know you were missing. Manzy has traveled all across the United States and released two albums since 2012. His third album, Warm Wine, is a collection of stories ranging from sweet to difficult times or a cross between the two. Produced and recorded by David Beck at Fast Horse Studios, Warm Wine is due to be released in the summer of 2018. Faced with the difficulty of categorizing his own music, Manzy asks that you give a listen and decide for yourself. Manzy has opened for popular bands including Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Dean Dillon, Hayes Carll, Corb Lund, Shane Smith and the Saints. He has shared the stage with The Tallent Brothers, The Possum Posse, Doug Moreland, and Mike and the Moonpies. In 2014, Manzy was accepted into The Last Honky Tonk Music Series.

A brotherhood joined through a passion for writing and performing music that comes from the soul. The original members of Law by the Gun met and became friends while attending Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas in 2012. Dylan Gully (Vocals) and Shawn Clampitt (Bass), friends originally from Dripping Springs, Texas, answered a Craigslist post from bothers Michael Lyons (Lead) and Zak Lyons (Drums), originally from Austin, Texas. The group of four joined together over the course of several months writing music spawned by Dylan's experiences growing up in the Texas Hill Country. A lyric from a song called \"Outlaw\" birthed the name of choice for the newly formed band: \"Law by the Gun\". The group quickly became regular performers in San Marcos and the greater Central Texas Area for five years. They continued to write music and grow a loyal local fan following, culminating with the release of a full length album in 2016: \"Lost in Austin\". Steven Tyson (Keyboard/Bass) joined in 2017 after the band had moved on from San Marcos to call Austin their full time home. The now five piece band continued to write and perform until bassist Shawn Clampitt moved to Minnesota in early 2018. With Shawn's departure, Steven moved to Bass full time, with the occasional five piece line-up featuring long time friend Dan Dulle (Bass/Guitar). And in early 2019, with Zak Lyons move to Dallas, Cliff Benson of Austin (Drums) became the group's full time drummer. Dylan, Michael, Steven, and Cliff have solidified the core of Law by the Gun, with special appearances by Dan.

An amalgam of genres and vocal style, Barakat isn\u2019t afraid to go where she thinks the music should take her.\u201d (PARADE MAGAZINE)   \u201cWhen trying to describe an artist like Hanna Barakat her voice and talent are such a given that it frees the listener to embrace the musical journey she takes you on. She is not afraid to step out of the box from song to song while still following her vision of song oriented rock layered in a luscious soundscape of melodic instrumentation and vocals. There is a message, emotion, and uniqueness within each song that transcends trends while still embracing the familiar.\u201d - John Moyer (Disturbed) New York, NY: Austin-based, hard/alternative artist, Hanna Barakat, announces her new  album, Siren, showcasing \u201ca vocally powerful performance by the Texas-native driven by compelling songwriting and thunderous production.\" (Substream Magazine) Born in Texas to a Lebanese father and American mother,  Barakat combines a variety of influences. \"While proudly paying homage to her roots, Barakat has cultivated her own style that merges Arab-Oriental influences with her love of rock music for a stunningly unique and original sound.\" (Metal Nexus). Pure Grain Audio declares, \"Artists come and go like skin cells but, sometimes, there are those that truly stand out for their immense talents. Barakat is clearly a member of the latter.\u201d   The album was produced by John Moyer, bassist from famed hard rock band, Disturbed, and mixed by Martin Nessi (Michael Jackson estate, Ariana Grande, Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Ricky Martin, Kelly Clarkson), and mastered by Ted Jensen of Sterling Sound (Disturbed, Evanescence, Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, Halestorm, Pat Metheny).   Barakat beautifully describes the inspiration behind the album:   \u201cI chose the title, Siren, for my debut record, after John Moyer and I produced our final song together, which happened to be \u201cSiren.\u201d The power of the music and the lyrics filled me with such fire. It motivated me and inspired me to take this next step in my journey with such confidence. Though the song references the mythical sirens of the sea, I loved the idea of a double meaning: an actual siren, warning call, alarm! The songs on this record were written over a span of 10 years. These songs have been my comfort and my therapy, as I\u2019ve journeyed this world, witnessed injustices, engrossed myself in my ancestral culture, grown within myself, literally travelled the globe, loved, lost, failed, loved again, and struggled to reach the place where I am today. I want to bring awareness to these situations, not by forcing any political agenda, but by pushing for love, understanding, and acceptance of all the other humans walking this earth together. Throughout history, there have been unnatural walls physically erected, or socially accepted and perpetuated, in order to divide people. I want to tear those walls down. All of them. Through my music, with rock guitars, heavy drums, deep rhythmic bass lines, and my intricate vocal melodic lines and punchy harmony stacks, I have chosen to forge Arab instruments like the oud, kanun, frame drum, riqq, into my sonic landscape, where I feel they so naturally and appropriately belong.\u201d For All Media Inquiries: Meijin Bruttomesso, Effective Immediately PR (212) 777-6727x209 / meijin@ei-pr.com", "otherInfo": "Neighbor's Kitchen & Yard Presents: Hanna + Lisa Live in the Yard!\nJoin us for a night of live music, awesome food, great ambiance, in a family friendly riverside oasis in Bastrop!\n\nSupport the Artists Directly:\nVenmo.com/hannabarakat\nPaypal.me/hannabarakat\nwww.hannabarakat.com/merch-store"}, {"Address": "208 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Brad Stivers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9144519.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2678607, -97.74096999999999], "Date": "2021-07-30", "EventDate": "Jul. 30th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Friends Bar", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "119 Cheatham St, San Marcos, TX 78666", "Artist": "Austin Meade ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10320164.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.8767312, -97.9397716], "Date": "2021-07-30", "EventDate": "Jul. 30th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Americana, Alternative", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Cheatham Street Warehouse", "moreBioInfo": "Meade is a child of the Millennium, yet his guitar style is descendant from the 70\u2019s classic rock age with notes that writhe like exposed nerves.

Growing up at countless rock concerts with his father cultivated his ambition to be an original artist. A former drummer, Meade played in a cover band for years while earning his business degree at Texas A&M in College Station before he peeled back another layer of himself and found a songwriter dwelling there. Now the frontman of his own band slinging guitar licks with expert precision, his music rolled out with two releases in 2014, his first EP \u201cLong Ways To Go\u201d followed by his first full-length album \u201cChief Of The Sinners.\u201d His next EP \u201cHeartbreak Coming\u201d came in 2016 with a couple of singles to announce his commencement on the Texas Music Chart.

They only ask that you dance toward a place in your mind beyond struggle and strife. Inspired by their experience at 2014's LAMC (Latin Alternative Music Conference) in New York, Superf\u00f3nicos was formed when bassist Nico Sanchez and guitarist Erick Bohorquez began discussions about creating a group with a foundation in Afro-Colombian rhythms. They soon teamed up with guitarist Andres Villegas and percussionist Daniel Sanchez, and started rehearsing together during time away from their other bands. That core group developed the band\u2019s unique sound, laying the foundation of what was to come. In 2016, gaitero and vocalist Jaime Ospina\u2014who has recorded with the likes of Pacha Massive\u2014relocated from Colombia to Austin, where he met and instantly connected with the group. It was also during this time that the band met with famed local producer and Grammy winner Adrian Quesada at Level One Sound.

I've grown to appreciate all sorts of music with the core belief that good music is music that communicates it's idea effectively, regardless of what that idea is. Most of my decisions to move to different cities revolved around what current band I was in. First was a small college town, Sherman TX to get a riffy-experimental- indie rock band Da Di Da off the ground. It was to little success, but thankfully brought me to Austin, TX my home for the past decade. Since then, I've played in a variety of cover bands and country acts, primarily playing bass and not loving my life too much. Post pandemic I decided to retire the bass and focus on my own music, primarily as a solo acoustic artist. My acoustic sets have shades of Conner Oberst, Pedro The Lion, Cold War Kids with the intense impassioned melodic intensity of early 2000s emo bands. My recordings have a mind of their own, typically full-band explosions of sound with clear influences of Coheed and Cambria as well as Mars Volta. In addition to my solo work, I happily play guitar for the Austin indie R&B artist Jake Lloyd.

And with good reason. The group\u2019s blend of Americana, country and blues quickly made them favorites, opening for the likes of Lukas Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver, and comedian Ron White. They have earned plaudits for their uptempo, high-energy live show, and they\u2019re also two-time recipients of a Black Fret Grant, which is given to rising bands in Austin, Texas. Yet, two albums into their career, the band wanted a change \u2014 after realizing that a slightly unexpected, non-musical element was holding them back. At the time, the band was called Texas K.G.B. No, they weren\u2019t a part of some Texan secret society or supporters of the Russian secret police. Instead, the group\u2019s moniker came from Green herself \u2014 Kelly Green Band. When they first formed, Green was the lead member and face of the band. However, that didn\u2019t stop wary bookers abroad from staying away from the band- despite their musical merits- due to perceived provocativeness of their name. When Lea joined in 2017, the band now had three strong singers and songwriters to front the stage. It no longer felt right to have a name focus on a single person. After they completed their latest album, band producer Gordy Quist of Band of Heathens suggested that they consider changing their name. As the times have become far more political in the three years since the band got going, the time was right for them to leave Texas K.G.B. in the past. Following multiple brainstorming sessions over the course of a few months, a name finally clicked. There were plenty of strong contenders, ultimately though, Madam Radar was the winner. Madam Radar\u2019s upcoming self-titled album is slated to be independently released in early 2020, and it\u2019s clear that their name change has energized them. It\u2019s easy to hear contributions across the board in every single song on the record, with various singers throughout. The collaborative process strengthened what were already tight songs and allowed them to flourish. Songs like \u201cFriend of a Friend\u201d and \u201cYoung Wild Love\u201d exemplify how fruitful the fluidity of this process were. Each song, albeit about two completely different subjects (the former is the importance of a support system and the latter about the trials that relationships bring), had different songwriters, yet at its core, stays true to the band\u2019s sound. The chill environment allowed Madam Radar to be at their collective best. With plans for a big 2020, in addition to the album\u2019s release, a tour is looming as well, the band is excited about the prospects of what\u2019s to come. Despite accomplishing as much as they did as Texas K.G.B., Madam Radar aren\u2019t looking back. With a new album ready to go, Madam Radar is excited to begin the next chapter of their burgeoning career. Be on the lookout for their new single, \u201cCarolina,\u201d to be released early 2020.", "otherInfo": "Filming for the music video \u201cFriend of a Friend\u201d at Poodie\u2019s in Spicewood!

He is the older brother of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Jimmie Vaughan's style was influenced by Freddie King who gave him personal advice. Also two other blues guitarists, Albert King and B. B. King, were important influences. Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson was another important early influence (Jimmie says that he and his younger brother Stevie studied Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson more than any other single guitarist). Jimmie Vaughan developed his own personal style that is easily recognized. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with singer and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Fergusson, and drummer Mike Buck. (The initial Fabulous Thunderbirds members were all proteges of Austin, Texas blues club owner, Clifford Antone.) The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. Sadly, since those early albums did not sell well, the band was left out without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the times when Jimmie's younger brother achieved popular success). The Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986 and made several albums that featured more commercial pop-music sound and production styles. Jimmie left the band in 1989 and made a \"duo album\" called Family Style with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album was released, Stevie died in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin on August 27, 1990. The album was released a few days after the tragic accident (the listed artist on the album was \"Vaughan Brothers\"). The album was light blues-influenced rock with Jimmie singing on several tracks. Vaughan released his first solo album Strange Pleasure in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself. In 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') huge debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album Blues Stop Knockin'.

He bought his first guitar, a knock-off Telecaster, when he was 15 years old and proceeded to learn everything from Garth Brooks to Nirvana, however it was the sound of the older generation that captured his imagination; George Jones, Johnny Cash, and Conway Twitty songs drifting from the radios and turntables of his grandmothers\u2019 kitchens and living rooms. This heritage is alive and well in McDonnell\u2019s earnest and straightforward songs and strong, clear baritone. Aaron formed the Pop Country band Gin Betty! shortly after moving to Seattle in 2004 recording two albums and quckly found himself with a following playing several top local venues including The Showbox, and The Triple Door. Gin Betty! was featured on a national college radio camapaign and received good responses particularly in Texas and other areas in the Southeastern United States. Personal turmoil within the band lead to it's unraveling and the formation of The Grandtours in 2009 (named after the classic George Jones tune \"The Grand Tour\"). This band explored darker territories lyrically and more complex sonic arrangements all the while staying rooted in a Classic Country Music format and flavor. Again, a local following was formed and two records were recorded, unfortunately they dissolved due to conflicts within the band in 2011. After taking some time off from playing music publicly, Aaron moved towards a solo project named Aaron McDonnell & The Gospel Plow which released an EP in January of 2013. The project was met with positive feedback from local club owners and members of the Seattle Country music scene receiving praise from veterans in the industry. With the release of his new EP \"Follow\", Aaron\u2019s emergence as a full solo artist in 2014 will be the culmination of a tough yet inspiring road which has spanded nearly a decade, including the formation and dissolution of three bands, recording of five records, and work with several top engineers/producers including; Tom Pfaffle (Nirvana, Black Crowes, Heart), Steve Aguilar (Dave Matthews Band, The Head & The Heart), and Phillip Peterson (The Posies, Portugal. The Man). With true purpose, his songs explore age-old themes of love, heartache, failure, and faith. They are classic in their influence and unpretentious in their delivery.

From there both stories, of nation and artist, sweep westward, drawing from new surroundings, absorbing what each station on their way has to offer. America\u2019s journey is still underway. But in a sense Chuck Shaw has found what he was looking for: a place where he can put down roots and nurture his unique artistry. For Shaw, that place is, as someone once crooned, deep in the heart of Texas. He\u2019s been there for just a few years but that\u2019s time enough for him to know he has come home. With his love for old-school country music, his ability to write songs nourished by that tradition and sing them with rare expression, this is where he has always belonged. \u201cEven when I was in high school back in New Jersey, I knew I was probably going to end up in Texas,\u201d he reflects. \u201cAnd later, when I was in Colorado and Wyoming, friends kept telling me, \u2018You need to move to Texas. You sound like you belong there. That\u2019s where the real stuff is.\u2019\u201d The \u201creal stuff\u201d is country music that\u2019s about substance, not style. All you need to do is listen to his self-titled debut album to know it\u2019s true. It\u2019s in the raunch, grit and swagger of \u201cDirty Woman Creek,\u201d the neon glow and greasy groove of \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time,\u201d the morning-after cobwebs and cold daylight that color \u201cHope I Can Get Through Today\u201d We could go through all 12 tracks, up to the handclaps and gospel affirmation of \u201cRise Up,\u201d each one written by Shaw except for his striking rendition of \u201cLong Black Veil\u201d and little-known gem \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time.\u201d Like so many good things in life, it goes by fast and easy and then lingers until it\u2019s cued up again. This is Lone Star country \u2014 but the deeper you listen, the more hints you hear of the path he took to reach that destination. In his first single, \u201cBurn That Oil,\u201d the harmonica riff and nostalgic reminiscence might bring Springsteen to mind. Shaw wouldn\u2019t deny it, being born and raised through high school in New Jersey. But even in his formative years, with his friends immersed mainly in rap, Shaw felt the call of country, first from groups like The Eagles and Creedence Clearwater Revival. \u201cA lot of the rock I grew up with had country roots,\u201d he says. \u201cThen one day in high school, after I\u2019d gotten my heart broken, I bought the John Fogerty album Blue Ridge Rangers, where he covered a bunch of country songs including \u2018She Thinks I Still Care.\u2019 That song really spoke to me. And through the album as a whole I discovered George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and all the others who would influence me so much.\u201d After getting his first electric guitar at age 13, Shaw formed a band \u2014 probably the only one in his part of the Garden State that featured a country fiddle player. He started writing songs too. The more he crafted his style, the more determined he was to seek inspiration out west, the cradle of the music he had come to love. So after graduation, he headed out to the Rocky Mountains to study creative writing at Colorado College. Equally important, he honed his vocal and instrumental chops with the school\u2019s celebrated Bluegrass Ensemble, an education that included three appearances at the Durango Bluegrass Meltdown. Eventually, after working for a couple of summers on a ranch in Wyoming and then spending a year in Arizona that included four months on the road with the country/rock band Mostly Water, Shaw made his pilgrimage to Nashville. With money he\u2019d saved from Mostly Water, he recorded an EP and, in the summer of 2015, started playing in Music City\u2019s fabled honky-tonks. Nights of grinding out country hits in touristy dives sharpened his performance skills. It also cued him when it was time to get out of town. \u201cIt was exciting at first,\u201d Shaw remembers. \u201cIt taught me how to interact with the crowd, how to get people excited. And there were some great singers and players down there. But I started hating it after a while because I just couldn\u2019t stand to play mainstream pop/country day and night, over and over again. Even songs that I loved got beaten to death. There was so little originality.\u201d And so Shaw embarked on the last stage of his Odyssey, this time to San Marcos late in 2016. Since then, he went from finding a place to live in a town filled with strangers to building up friends and followers through open-mike nights and paying gigs throughout Central Texas. \u201cI fought hard to play anywhere I could,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if meant annoying the heck out of club owners, I did what I had to do to get my name out there.\u201d Persistence has paid off and put this young man square in the spotlight as one of traditional country\u2019s most promising new talents.

Sniper 66 was formed in 2009, by singer/guitarist Dylan Close and bassist Jeff Ellis, later rounded out by guitarist Jeremy Brister and drummer April Schupmann. They play punk, tight and crisp with bullet-paced drums. While giving a nod to the forefathers, they also blend in the fury of 90\u2019s punk. Sniper 66 has continued to put a modern spin on a classic genre of music. Incendiary, invigorating sounds have been distilled to ensure maximum delivery. You can hear bands like Oxymoron, One Way System, Abrasive Wheels, and The Virus weave in and out of these still original sounds. Rock and roll grit fuels tunes like \u201cFirecracker\u201d, and \u201cI Know It\u2019s True\u201d from their breakout self-titled album. Their second, Caput Lupinum, features aggressive and thoughtful tracks like \u201cAnother War\u201d and \u201cSociety\". They released a split 7 inch with Denver's Potato Pirates in early 2016, which features the song \"Warrior's Way\"...accompanied by a \u2018killer\u2019 music video! A european release in 2017 brought a 7\" with hit \"Bury Me In My Boots\" as a teaser to their third full length they recently recorded with Chris Fogal in Denver that is due out in 2018! Their relentless tour schedule has seen them cover the United States a few times over, keeping their fans hungry, always earning new followers along the way. They have played Tulsa's popular Fuck You, We Rule OK! festival in 2013 & 2015, Midwest Live & Loud in 2014, the main stage and a pool party for 2015's Punk Rock Bowling in Las Vegas, and most recently shared the main stage with GBH and many more at 2016's Rude Fest in St. Louis, and did a tour with Bad Co. Project (ex-Oxymoron) in the northeast United States as part of their larger Stand Your Ground Tour, before playing all over Europe in the fall coupled with an appearance at Munich's Pogorausch Festival. A few flyouts and short tours in 2017 kept the band busy as they wrote and recorded their third LP. This band is showing no signs of slowing down! They are garnering attention in 2018, and will be taking their new album, Annihilator, back across the states and Europe.

Pure Grain Audio declares, \"Artists come and go like skin cells but, sometimes, there are those that truly stand out for their immense talents. Barakat is clearly a member of the latter.\u201d   The album was produced by John Moyer, bassist from famed hard rock band, Disturbed, and mixed by Martin Nessi (Michael Jackson estate, Ariana Grande, Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Ricky Martin, Kelly Clarkson), and mastered by Ted Jensen of Sterling Sound (Disturbed, Evanescence, Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, Halestorm, Pat Metheny).   Barakat beautifully describes the inspiration behind the album:   \u201cI chose the title, Siren, for my debut record, after John Moyer and I produced our final song together, which happened to be \u201cSiren.\u201d The power of the music and the lyrics filled me with such fire. It motivated me and inspired me to take this next step in my journey with such confidence. Though the song references the mythical sirens of the sea, I loved the idea of a double meaning: an actual siren, warning call, alarm! The songs on this record were written over a span of 10 years. These songs have been my comfort and my therapy, as I\u2019ve journeyed this world, witnessed injustices, engrossed myself in my ancestral culture, grown within myself, literally travelled the globe, loved, lost, failed, loved again, and struggled to reach the place where I am today. I want to bring awareness to these situations, not by forcing any political agenda, but by pushing for love, understanding, and acceptance of all the other humans walking this earth together. Throughout history, there have been unnatural walls physically erected, or socially accepted and perpetuated, in order to divide people. I want to tear those walls down. All of them. Through my music, with rock guitars, heavy drums, deep rhythmic bass lines, and my intricate vocal melodic lines and punchy harmony stacks, I have chosen to forge Arab instruments like the oud, kanun, frame drum, riqq, into my sonic landscape, where I feel they so naturally and appropriately belong.\u201d For All Media Inquiries: Meijin Bruttomesso, Effective Immediately PR (212) 777-6727x209 / meijin@ei-pr.com", "otherInfo": "Hanna + Lisa Duo live at 12 Fox Beer Co.

The EP, \u201cMaybe More,\u201d is the result of taking her personal stories and writing experience and adding in some of the top songwriters and producers in the business. A few years after creating \u201cMaybe More\u201d and the EP landing multiple nominations for the Hollywood Music and Media Awards and various other competitions, more stars aligned and after several trips back and forth from Nashville and many hours writing and recording, she finished her first full album, which includes the songs off of the \u201cMaybe More\u201d EP as well as seven new songs created with the help of the incredible Jeff Pardo (Lady Antebellum, Matthew West, Colton Dixon). Since its release, the album has received great reviews and has also received numerous award nominations.

In the past few years she has performed hundreds of shows including a tour with High School Nation and \u201cDrake and Josh\u201d star Drake Bell, Six Flags Over Texas, Rodeo Austin, Goorin SXSW, Grapefest, and Berges Fest among others. She has also appeared live on both Good Morning Texas and Good Day Austin in the past few months.

Bethany works hard to make her music relatable, not just to other 20-year-old girls but to people of all ages and all walks of life.

A brotherhood joined through a passion for writing and performing music that comes from the soul. The original members of Law by the Gun met and became friends while attending Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas in 2012. Dylan Gully (Vocals) and Shawn Clampitt (Bass), friends originally from Dripping Springs, Texas, answered a Craigslist post from bothers Michael Lyons (Lead) and Zak Lyons (Drums), originally from Austin, Texas. The group of four joined together over the course of several months writing music spawned by Dylan's experiences growing up in the Texas Hill Country. A lyric from a song called \"Outlaw\" birthed the name of choice for the newly formed band: \"Law by the Gun\". The group quickly became regular performers in San Marcos and the greater Central Texas Area for five years. They continued to write music and grow a loyal local fan following, culminating with the release of a full length album in 2016: \"Lost in Austin\". Steven Tyson (Keyboard/Bass) joined in 2017 after the band had moved on from San Marcos to call Austin their full time home. The now five piece band continued to write and perform until bassist Shawn Clampitt moved to Minnesota in early 2018. With Shawn's departure, Steven moved to Bass full time, with the occasional five piece line-up featuring long time friend Dan Dulle (Bass/Guitar). And in early 2019, with Zak Lyons move to Dallas, Cliff Benson of Austin (Drums) became the group's full time drummer. Dylan, Michael, Steven, and Cliff have solidified the core of Law by the Gun, with special appearances by Dan. Law by the Gun continues to perform regularly around Austin and Texas, and continues to write music; with plans to release a second full length album. Inspired by the Texas music scene and artists like Reckless Kelly, Wade Bowen, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and Robert Earl Keen, they draw influences from classic country, americana, alternative, rock, blues, and more. In that same tradition, Law By The Gun embraces their roots, but sound current, fresh, and entirely original.", "otherInfo": "https://www.facebook.com/events/225223542289690"}, {"Address": "14757 W, Kingsland, TX 78639", "Artist": "Wade Bowen ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11345758.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.6550495, -98.4416857], "Date": "2021-07-31", "EventDate": "Jul. 31st, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Texas Country Music, Country, Red Dirt Country, Outlaw Country, Texas Country", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Wakepoint LBJ", "moreBioInfo": "Waco native Wade Bowen began recording Solid Ground intent on making the artistic statement of his career \u2013 a high bar considering the twenty years of success he\u2019s enjoyed \u2013 but as his personal odometer rolled over into his fourth decade, his focus is more on legacy than next Saturday night. \u201cI started thinking, \u2018how much longer can I do this and matter as a writer?\u2019 My thinking is, I hope I can be like Guy Clark at 72 years old, still making great records that people still give a damn about. So I took my time with every aspect of this process.\u201d Solid Ground is personal but not necessarily autobiographical, peppered with distinct south-of-the-border imagery of \u201cAcuna,\u201d and the nostalgic reflection of \u201cSo Long Sixth Street.\u201d Rolling Stone spoke well of \u201cDay of the Dead,\u201d noting \u201cthe mariachi influence, with accordion, Spanish guitar and a horn section augmenting Bowen's more familiar Red Dirt shuffle.\u201d The combination is Bowen\u2019s signature - Texas flavor strongly spicing his mix of country, blues, rock and Americana. The parched scenery, weathered outlook and gravelly vocals created a less-than-pristine album that was championed by producer Keith Gattis. Writing and vocal contributions from Andrew Combs, Jack Ingram, Waylon Payne, Angaleena Presley, Jon Randall, Lucie Silvas, and Charlie Worsham, among others. \u201cI wanted to be pushed more than I\u2019ve ever been pushed\u2026 but I guess be careful what you ask for,\u201d Bowen laughed. \u201cI wrote every day in the studio with Gattis. He wanted me there early to write every morning and we were recording before I even knew what the song was going to be.\u201d As for Keith Gattis, the mission was clear to them both, \u201cI started working with Wade knowing two things: One, this isn\u2019t a guy who was going to rest on his laurels, he wanted to respect tradition but shake it up. Two, he earned his rep as a rocker and entertainer years ago\u2026this album is about Wade as a musician and songwriter. The first time I saw Wade play years ago was in a Texas dancehall. Usually, the band plays standards and the crowd is there to two-step. But Wade was part of a \u201cnew scene.\u201d It was the first time I saw a crowd rush to the stage like it was rock show.\u201d Gattis continued, \u201cAs we were writing, we reminisced a lot. A festival down in Lajitas we\u2019d played or the beer halls in Texas - that vibe snuck into the writing. This definitely isn\u2019t an \u201cany town\u201d album, it\u2019s about where Wade\u2019s from. But the storytelling is honest and that makes it relatable. We also had the benefit of a band of rock star players and songwriters. Audley Freed (Black Crowes) on guitar brought his roots rock approach, as did Jeff Trotts (Sheryl Crow) on guitar and lapsteel, Fred Eltringham (Wallflowers, Willie Nelson, Robert Plant) on drums, Billie Mercer (Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams) on bass, and great players on keys like Jenn Gunderman (Sheryl Crow), Rami Jaffee (Wallflowers, Foo Fighters), John Henry Trinko (Randy Houser).\u201d The most demanding writing and recording experience of his career has captured a singular creative period and created a cohesive album. The result is infinitely more satisfying than writing watered down tunes for the broadest audience possible. Enter Thirty Tigers, the Nashville-based champions of Bowen\u2019s sound and vision. \"I've been a fan of Wade's since Lost Hotel,\u201d says Thirty Tigers\u2019 Co-founder and President David Macias. \u201cI've dutifully asked over the years about Wade coming into the family, and I could not be more excited about him finally saying yes! He's a gifted storyteller and a great performer. And this album is fantastic.\" Along with crediting producer Keith Gattis for what Solid Ground has become, Bowen heaps praise on Texas brethren like George Strait, Stevie Ray Vaughan, ZZ Top and Robert Earl Keen who have paved the way sonically for the not-quite-country, not-quite-rock sound aimed at those who view Springsteen, Tom Petty and Mellencamp as influential as Guy Clark. Bowen said contemporaries like Jack Ingram, who appears on the record, are quick to lend a hand in the studio or to appear at fundraising live music jams for the Bowen Family Foundation that have raised more than $2.5 million for family and children\u2019s charities throughout Texas. Bowen\u2019s mission to set himself apart as a songwriter is driven in part by wanting to measure up to an almost impossible standard (Clark). He wonders if he or any other current musician will ever be able to measure up in any meaningful way. \u201cSolid Ground hits the bar more than anything I've never done before. It has an edge and the balls we\u2019ve always had live but hadn\u2019t gotten down on a record until now,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know if Guy Clark would like the record, but I\u2019d feel comfortable playing those songs on a stage with him and asking him what he thought.\u201d With Solid Ground, Bowen has made his clearest statement. It\u2019s the one that took him 40 years to make, and the wait and hard work to get there has been worth it.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "145 FM2673, Canyon Lake, TX 78133", "Artist": "Jordan Robert Kirk ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9416834.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.8615609, -98.15984700000001], "Date": "2021-07-31", "EventDate": "Jul. 31st, 2021", "Genre": "Blues, Country, Western Revival, Honky Tonk", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "River Rose Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "Jordan Robert Kirk is a native of West Texas.

Their old school approaches of reaching fans one by one has definitely helped them earn this title and are touted by industry insiders as the way to succeed in this music economy. Jeff says, \u201cIt\u2019s like knocking on doors. Eventually one will open and when it does be prepared! We want to build relationships with our fans and this is the way to do it.\u201d It helps when the music interests a wide variety of fans. \u201cWe appeal to people who listen to country and even some that regularly don\u2019t. People tell us all the time that we don\u2019t sound like anyone else,\u201d and this is a natural reaction to Jeff, as he puts it, \u201cbecause every song speaks to those who listen.\u201d This individuality has earned them notice at every venue, and there is a common response. \u201cWe\u2019ll play a set and take a break and fans come up and say \u2018Where the hell have you been!\u2019 like we\u2019ve been hiding in plain sight,\u201d chuckles Jeff. Since their latest release in October 2015, they were nominated for best new band of 2017 and Jeff Jacobs took home the Best New Male Artist of 2017 from the Big Star 97 awards. Other notable mentions are a Finalist for Homer\u2019s Backyard Ball battle of the bands, Hard Rock Cafe\u2019s Battle of the Bands runner up, and two charting singles on the Texas Regional Radio Report. Jeff Jacobs Band also collaborated with The Roundup in Boerne, Texas to create the Black Friday Texas Music Festival to support Texas music.

Music history is filled with stories of the rise and fall of creative personalities, but the Randy Rogers Band is a unique brotherhood fueled by a shared passion for making great music and a strong commitment to each other. That bond forms the foundation for the new music on their latest album Hellbent, a high-octane collection of songs buoyed by the same fearless spirit and sense of camaraderie that has made them one of country\u2019s most compelling bands. In a business where bands come and go and membership is often a revolving door, the Randy Rogers Band has been together for more than 17 years. \u201cJust like any other relationship, you have to pick your battles and have respect for each other,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cNone of us know how to do anything else. This is our livelihood. It\u2019s how we take care of our families. Years ago when we were really struggling and wondering how we were going to make it, there were some deep and emotional conversations that we all had with each other about if this is really what we all wanted and the decision was made a long time ago. The answer was yes then and the answer is still yes now. It\u2019s something we all believe in. This is our life\u2019s work.\u201d The culmination of their musical journey thus far can be heard on Hellbent. \u201cCreatively we all bring something different to the table and you can hear it in the records,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cYou can hear people\u2019s personalities in the records.\u201d It\u2019s that blend of unique personalities that have fueled the Randy Rogers Band\u2019s success for nearly two decades. \u201cOur bass player, Johnny Chops, has this way of writing. It\u2019s a little old school, a little Waylon-esque if you will. His lyrics aren\u2019t necessarily anything like mine. They are a little bit more vague and more interpretive,\u201d Rogers says, bragging on his bandmate. \u201cWhat Brady Black adds to our makeup is his sensibility on stage, his appearance, his energy, his unique way that he plays the fiddle. He\u2019s a crowd pleaser.\u201d \u201cLes Lawless, our drummer, has played on hundreds of albums with many different artists. He\u2019s kind of the human metronome. He\u2019s a solid drummer. I can\u2019t recall a mistake he\u2019s ever made on stage. He\u2019s just a rock. Geoffrey Hill [guitar, vocals] is a very talented musician. He\u2019s a great singer, a great harmony singer. Most of our sound as a band is because of Geoffrey and his unique vocals and the way he blends his vocals with my vocals.\u201d Of course, the lineup wouldn\u2019t be complete without longtime member Todd Stewart. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an instrument that Todd can\u2019t play and he sings well,\u201d Rogers enthuses. \u201cOnstage he\u2019s playing guitar on one song, mandolin on the next one, fiddle on the next one and a piano on the next one and a B3 on the next one. He\u2019s a key part of our band because he fills up all those spots musically that no one else can do like him. It\u2019s fascinating to watch him switch between every song.\u201d That dynamic musical chemistry has taken the Randy Rogers Band beyond the competitive music scene in their native Texas to build a national fan base with sold out shows across the country. The band has become skilled at capturing that live energy and passion on their albums and Hellbent is a perfect example. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this process long enough to know that we wanted this record to be perfect and complete so we kept writing and went back in and we recorded again,\u201d Rogers reveals. \u201cIt is important, especially in today\u2019s day and age, not to put out content just for the sake of content. People see through that and it\u2019s a big mistake young artists make just to put a video or a new song out just to have something to talk about. There is a lost art to making an entire album, being a cohesive unit and have it be something that you can stand up and play. We have to record songs we can play live. Ninety nine percent of the income we share is because we\u2019re playing a show, so those songs can\u2019t be throwaway songs.\u201d The first single, \u201cCrazy People,\u201d is a relatable tune that paints a picture of strict parents that weren\u2019t always so straight-laced. \u201cI did not write that song, however, I did live that song, and that\u2019s why I cut it,\u201d Rogers says with a chuckle. \u201cWhen I heard it, I could imagine that my parents weren\u2019t always fanatically religious. As a young kid, I definitely wasn\u2019t comfortable around neon signs or around restaurants where they were serving alcohol. I just thought that was something very, very bad and that\u2019s what was instilled in my head. It was very, very much a sin, so I was a little freaked out when I was a kid. It\u2019s nothing against my parents. Both me and my brother turned out just fine, but I just think there was this sense of over protection and security and a lot of that was based around the church. So the first thing I did when I turned 16 was tried everything.\u201d Another highlight on the album is \u201cYou, Me and a Bottle,\u201d penned by Rogers. \u2018I love love songs, and that song is a carefree kind of love song about kind of getting lost with your significant other,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThe troubles of the world and stresses of the week fade when you are with that one special person. That all disappears. That\u2019s kind of the feel-good song on the album I think and the prettiest love song on the record.\u201d On the other end of the emotional spectrum, \u201cAnchors Away\u201d is about a man who can\u2019t commit and keeps running from love. \u201c\u2018Anchors Away\u2019 is a very sad song,\u201d Rogers admits. \u201cThe chorus says, \u2018Anchors away, works like a charm, first sign of danger, I pull the alarm,\u2019 and the lyrics that really get to me are, \u2018I don\u2019t want to leave, I don\u2019t know how to stay.\u2019 That lyric to me really paints the picture of somebody who doesn\u2019t know how to love and doesn\u2019t know how to love someone back. Out of all the lyrics on the album, that lyric might be the most poignant lyric because a lot of times people sabotage themselves and relationships they are in because they don\u2019t know any better because they\u2019ve seen their parents do it or they are just in a cycle repeating the same mistakes. I think that\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d \u201cWine in a Coffee Cup\u201d paints an interesting portrait of a high-powered career woman. \u201cWomen have roles in the workplace that are very different than they were maybe 50 years ago,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThere are a lot of CEOs, CFOs, a lot of presidents and vice presidents. Huge companies are run by women. It\u2019s an interesting fact that nobody is perfect and my idea of that song was a CEO of a company walking in every day and everybody thinks she has everything together and her life is perfect, but in all actuality she is like everybody else. She\u2019s struggling with something. It could be her relationship, home life or family, but even the most successful people have flaws, so that was my take on it. It\u2019s a nod to women and the fact that they are, in this day in age, hopefully treated as equals in the workplace but here\u2019s this girl that\u2019s running the company and she\u2019s coming in buzzed every day. That song isn\u2019t about someone I know personally. It\u2019s about the culture and the environment we live in now. I guarantee that that song is happening somewhere.\u201d \u201cHell Bent on a Heartache\u201d is a song Rogers first heard and fell in love with on Guy Clark\u2019s album My Favorite Picture of You. \u201cI love that album start to finish and that song was my favorite song. Chris Stapleton and his wife, Morgane, wrote that with Guy Clark and I had no clue,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were in the studio the week Tom Petty died and on that track especially there is this kind of Heartbreaker kind of feel to that song. It\u2019s produced in a way that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers would have done it. The influence definitely shines through on this album, especially on that track.\u201d In recording Hellbent, the Randy Rogers Band worked with producer Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, The Oak Ridge Boys, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) and recorded at the legendary RCA Studio A. \u201cA large part of the country really enjoys the records that he\u2019s made over the last 10 years and obviously I was paying attention to that,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cI was noticing the albums I was listening to, and they were produced by him, so I called him up and asked if we could meet for lunch. I\u2019d never worked with him before, so it was a very exciting going into RCA and meeting him and the team. We\u2019re very thankful for that opportunity and getting to record in Studio A. So many people whether it be Dolly Parton or George Strait have recorded in that room, so it was a bit of hallowed ground. It was a little overwhelming as well. There\u2019s pictures all over the walls there of people who recorded. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d Recording Hellbent is just the latest chapter in the Randy Rogers Band\u2019s thriving career. In addition to being a gifted vocalist, insightful songwriter and talented musician, the band\u2019s founding member is also well known in music industry circles for his business savvy. He graduated from college with a degree in PR and is one of those rare musicians who has great executive skills too. Rogers is co-owner of several Texas venues including Cheatham Street Warehouse in San Marcos, Texas where George Strait began building a fan base in his early career. Rogers is also a partner in Big Blind Management with Robin Schoepf and steers the careers of Red Shahan and Parker McCollum. Rogers seems to have a unique talent for seeing around corners. It\u2019s what drove him to take his band outside of Texas and develop fans on both coasts, even when the initial investment was risky. \u201cI\u2019m left brain and right brain,\u201d the Cleburne, Texas native says. \u201cI\u2019m a very organized person and I can also see six months from now. I\u2019m always thinking a step ahead and it wears my wife out because I\u2019m talking about booking my life months from now. My brain is always spinning and thinking about what is coming next instead of really sitting in a moment. That\u2019s a good thing and sometimes it\u2019s a bad thing that I can never really turn my brain off.\u201d Rogers is also a big fan of collaboration and has partnered with friend Wade Bowen on the infectious Hold My Beer projects and joined forces with Lone Star legend Robert Earl Keen as the Stryker Brothers. He recently joined Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker to sing on Michael Martin Murphey\u2019s Austinology album. Though Rogers is prone to eagerly explore other musical avenues, the core of his creative adventure continues to be the Randy Rogers Band. For Rogers, Hellbent was the perfect name for the album, and not just because it comes from one of his favorite songs. \u201cThe album is named Hellbent and isn\u2019t necessarily for \u2018Hell Bent On a Heartache.\u2019 We\u2019re in it for the long haul. We\u2019re lifers,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cThis is obviously our way of life. This isn\u2019t some Johnny-come-lately group of guys. We\u2019re like an oak tree. We\u2019re not going anywhere. We\u2019re not hinged on whether our next single will be a No.1. We\u2019re not hinged on an album topping the charts. We have a great and loyal fan base and we do things right. When we play our shows, people expect to have a great night and to go home satisfied. As long as we keep doing that, no change in the industry, no record deal or anything like that can make or break this band.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "110 S Harris St, Round Rock, TX 78664", "Artist": "Chase Gassaway, Songwriter ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6205759.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.5068648, -97.6818793], "Date": "2021-07-31", "EventDate": "Jul. 31st, 2021", "Genre": "Folk Alternative, Acoustic Americana, Classical, Acoustic Folk, Alternative Folk-rock, Americana, Folk Acoustic Rock, Acoustic Folk Pop, Americana & Pop, Alternative Acoustic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "URBAN Eat.Drink", "moreBioInfo": "At only 30 years old, singer-songwriter Chase Gassaway has more musical experience than most artists twice his age. And he\u2019s putting it to good use with the release of his second solo album, Certain Circles, his first full-length record in nearly a decade. A lifelong Texan, Gassaway studied music composition and theory in college, honing his skills as a composer by creating works for a wide range of ensembles from choirs to full orchestras, as well as composing the score to short film Take Two. He has also been trained in classical guitar and voice, and plays a variety of instruments from banjolele to reed organ. His training, and the onstage lessons he\u2019s learned as a solo performer and member of groups such as Canaries in the Coal Mine and formally the Matchmaker Band, has resulted in multi-textured pop songs that recall the Head & the Heart and Ben Folds. In a Chase Gassaway song, it\u2019s not unusual to hear strings, horns, woodwinds and piano accompanying Gassaway\u2019s engaging lyrics and slightly husky vocals, which might remind listeners of Jakob Dylan\u2019s. Married to his college sweetheart, Gassaway rarely writes about the trials and tribulations of relationships. Instead, he prefers to use his music as a means to explore the inner workings of the human spirit, call for social justice and hope, and encourage people to \u201cask questions they never thought to ask.\u201d The result is an album that\u2019s both insightful and inspirational. Certain Circles has been a work of optimism since its Kickstarter campaign genesis. While Gassaway does get pensive on \u201cBreak of Dawn,\u201d the introspective and rootsy \u201cWhere I\u2019m Coming From,\u201d and the poignant piano ballad \u201cThe Ship,\u201d the overarching theme of the record is hope. The opening track, \u201cTurn This Thing Around,\u201d is a buoyant, horn-heavy tune that offers a positive outlook for the future while serving as a plea for people to find common ground and love one another. The banjo licks and group singalong anchoring \u201cFeeling Good\u201d are guaranteed mood-enhancers, and the anthem \u201cHear Love,\u201d which closes the album, is the apotheosis of that hopeful tone. Recorded in six days at Ramble Creek Recording Studio in Austin, most of the album\u2019s 10 tracks were captured in one take. The result is an organic feel perfectly suiting the material, which Gassaway wrote and produced himself. Instead of pigeonholing his music into Americana, folk or alternative categories, Gassaway prefers to pursue diversity and eclecticism. \u201cI\u2019ve written full symphonic works, choral pieces, chamber music and folk songs, and they\u2019re all the same for me,\u201d he explains. \u201cI like to think of my style as \u2018honest.\u2019\u201d SELECTED RECORDING HISTORY Chase Gassaway, Certain Circles, 2014 \u2013 writer, producer, vocals, guitars, ukulele, banjolele, percussion, reed organ, brass/string/wind orchestration; piano on \u201cThe Ship\u201d Jordan Whitmore, Consider It Done, 2013 \u2013 producer, guitars, ukulele, banjolele, harmonica, piano, typewriter, percussion, brass/wind orchestration Jack Burton, Soul, 2013 - vocals Lamar Stockton & The Mourning Doves, Tearing At The Seams, 2012 \u2013 vocals Jordan Whitmore, Fondly, 2012 \u2013 guitar, keys and producer for \u201cBecause He Did\u201d track.

At an early age, Beckmann discovered his passion for writing songs and performing. The 24 year-old singer considers his music to be a blend between Traditional Country and Americana, and often writes songs that are reflective of his small town upbringing. Beckmann\u2019s new album \"Outskirts of Town\" is a compilation of songs that captures the innocence of young love in Del Rio and the difficulties that come with leaving that behind. The seven-song album was released in late November of 2018 and includes the single \u201cI Wanna See You Tonight\u201d which has a classic 90\u2019s country sound.

Since 1991, the group has enthralled listeners with a singular sound that fearlessly crisscrosses genres. The trio\u2019s questing spirit drives it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. It even throws in the occasional surf or spaghetti Western tune for good measure. Comprised of Bert Lams, Hideyo Moriya and Paul Richards, the group has established a unique, personal connection with audiences. In addition to dazzling musicianship and interplay, The California Guitar Trio's (CGT) shows are full of captivating stories and humor that enable concertgoers to feel like they're part of the music, not just spectators. In fact, the group\u2019s goal is to transcend their instruments, so people focus on the music first, and its considerable technical prowess a distant second. CGT's 16 albums, streamed over 65 million times on Pandora, offer diverse snapshots of the group\u2019s mercurial muse. The trio\u2019s most recent release Komorebi showcases its acoustic side, with beautiful lush originals and innovative cover arrangements of Beatles, Beach Boys and more. Other highlights include Masterworks and album of classical works, with expansive takes on Bach, Beethoven, Arvo P\u00e4rt, and Schubert. Andromeda, which combines their many influences into a visionary album of original material; CG3+2, an exploration of kinetic rock territory in collaboration with bassist Tony Levin and drummer Pat Mastelotto; and Echoes, which reimagines timeless material by artists such as Mike Oldfield, Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra, Pink Floyd, and Queen. The trio\u2019s output has made a major global impact, having served as the soundtrack for Olympics coverage, and programs on CNN, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. They have fans in high places too: Nasa used their music to wake the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. CGT's lineup is truly the sum of its distinct parts: A Utah native now residing in Los Angeles, Paul Richards immersed himself in rock, blues, jazz, and folk during his early days and while attending The University of Utah\u2019s jazz guitar program. Bert Lams, originally from Belgium, graduated from the prestigious Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels, specializing in classical guitar. Tokyo-born Hideyo Moriya began his guitar journey with surf music and British rock, before relocating to Boston to study at Berklee. All three felt the call to push themselves to the limit by enrolling in Robert Fripp\u2019s challenging Guitar Craft courses, where they first met in 1987. They went on to tour together as part of Fripp\u2019s League of Crafty Guitarists, before forming the California Guitar Trio in Los Angeles four years later. Recently, the trio expanded its collaborative possibilities by working within a six-guitar format with the Montreal Guitar Trio. During these groundbreaking, highly-entertaining shows, the acts perform inventive arrangements of each other\u2019s repertoire, and new music for guitar sextet. 26 years and 1,800+ gigs later, the CGT remains intensely committed to explore, evolve and communicate a wide-ranging musical worldview. - By Anil Prasad", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "719 Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Mo Amer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8005078.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2695156, -97.7418297], "Date": "2021-07-31", "EventDate": "Jul. 31st, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Stateside at the Paramount", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3610 Ranch Rd 1869, Liberty Hill, TX 78642", "Artist": "The Steel Belts ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11589429.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.6638669, -97.92709090000001], "Date": "2021-07-31", "EventDate": "Jul. 31st, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Agape BBQ", "moreBioInfo": "The band formed in late 2013 drawing from the trio\u2019s decades of collective experience performing across a wide variety of musical genres.

Together, they keep shattering misconceptions country folks have about punk rockers and vice versa.\" -Bobby More // Stomp and Stammer \"Jenny Don't and The Spurs are a fantastic independent country and western quartet who sing heart wrenching songs about emotional turmoil wit passion and honesty. The quartet's albums will make classic country western fans extremely proud.\" - Jersey Beat Since their inception in 2012, the Spurs have kept a relentless schedule of recording, playing locally, and touring. After nearly 500 live appearances in almost a dozen countries, and with a slew of albums and singles to their name, Jenny Don\u2019t And The Spurs are just getting warmed up. The Spurs were founded one cold, winter\u2019s evening by Jenny and Kelly. Jenny had been fronting her own band, DON\u2019T, for some time, as well as playing the occasional solo acoustic set here and there. Kelly, who had been in a slew of Portland punk bands since the 80\u2019s, and who had spent the previous several years balancing a grueling touring schedule playing drums with the garage rock trio PIERCED ARROWS and bass with Portland punk-rock destroyers P.R.O.B.L.E.M.S., and wanted to switch gears a bit. After the concept of forming a raw, real, and back-to-the-roots country band had taken hold, it wasn\u2019t long before the couple was rehearsing a seminal set of standards by such influential early country crooners and outlaws like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Ernest Tubb, and Hank Sr., as well as a sprinkling of originals. It was only a few weeks later that Kelly\u2019s bandmates Fred and Toody Cole got wind of the developing musical project that was taking form in Jenny and Kelly\u2019s kitchen and decided to call their bluff by giving them an unsolicited support slot on an upcoming show featuring the Cole\u2019s own solo two-piece act. Not having anticipated such a high-profile live appearance as a first live outing, and feeling like the guitar-and-bass-only lineup that the band had started life as was lacking something on the rhythm end of things, they decided to ask their friend Sam Henry to join them on drums. Sam, who in addition to being Jenny\u2019s bandmate in DON\u2019T and sometimes solo-set-collaborator, had already had a long, well respected career as one of Portland\u2019s best drummers, having played with such first-generation punk bands as the Wipers, The Rats and Napalm Beach. After a couple of weeks of practice, the debut live appearance of the band went off without a hitch and the core lineup of Jenny Don\u2019t And The Spurs was born. The trio of Jenny, Kelly, and Sam existed in this form for the first year-an-a-half or so of the band\u2019s existence, playing whatever local venue would take them \u2013 bars, clubs, porches, basements, backyards, and even a bookstore. This worked well for a while, and occasionally the Spurs would enlist talent from a pool of several friends to sit in on lead guitar or lap steel. The addition of a second guitar rounded out the sound of the band to the point where Jenny and Co. decided to make it a permanent part of the band\u2019s lineup. After a couple of false starts and a bit of difficulty finding a fourth member who could commit to the Spur\u2019s sometimes grueling touring schedule, the incredible Christopher March became a member of the family in early 2017. Christopher brought with him a wealth of talent and live gig experience, having spent years playing on the Northwest Country, Rockabilly, and Honky-Tonk circuit. Now, with several West Coast and North American tours, as well as three European tours and hundreds of local shows under their tooled-leather Western belts, the Spurs are gearing up for the release of their third full-length studio album. The Spurs are a musical force to be reckoned with, the intensity and energy of their live set, and dazzling Western outfits handmade by Jenny herself, the band is a must-see for anyone who enjoys spirited garage-infused country music played with sincerity and raw conviction.", "otherInfo": "Charley Crockett\nSaturday, July 31, 2021 External Link Icon Facebook Icon TripAdvisor Icon Yelp Icon\nThis is a full capacity show.

Consequently, his music is a combination of familiar sounds that cannot be made to fit neatly into one genre. Manzy's musical influences began with his grandmother's love for the folk and hymns along with his brother's love for rock and roll with a blues flair. In college, Manzy was introduced to the sounds of The Band, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Tom Petty, and Jason Boland. Inspired, he picked up a guitar and soon began playing, writing, and performing. Manzy is now known for his original ballads that are rough around the edges and dusty like an old book left on the shelf. His stories can paint pictures that transport your mind to a particular place in time. Manzy's compositions are unique and authentic even if that means going against popular demand. The result: a sound that you didn't know you were missing. Manzy has traveled all across the United States and released two albums since 2012. His third album, Warm Wine, is a collection of stories ranging from sweet to difficult times or a cross between the two. Produced and recorded by David Beck at Fast Horse Studios, Warm Wine is due to be released in the summer of 2018. Faced with the difficulty of categorizing his own music, Manzy asks that you give a listen and decide for yourself. Manzy has opened for popular bands including Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Dean Dillon, Hayes Carll, Corb Lund, Shane Smith and the Saints. He has shared the stage with The Tallent Brothers, The Possum Posse, Doug Moreland, and Mike and the Moonpies. In 2014, Manzy was accepted into The Last Honky Tonk Music Series.

When there is nothing to be done, nothing is done: Crimson disappears. When there is music to be played, Crimson reappears. If all of life were this simple\". Robert Fripp. King Crimson was conceived in November 1968 and born on January 13th 1969 in the Fulham Palace Cafe, London (Fripp/Ian McDonald/Greg Lake/Michael Giles/Pete Sinfield), coming to prominence after supporting The Rolling Stones at Hyde Park. Their ground-breaking debut In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969) described by Pete Townshend as \"an uncanny masterpiece\", began a career that has spanned four decades and influenced many bands and individuals including Yes, Genesis, Tool, and Porcupine Tree. Despite the original line-up imploding after an American tour King Crimson continued to produce constantly challenging and intriguing music on albums such as In The Wake of Poseidon (1970), Lizard (1970), Islands (1971), Earthbound (1972), Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973) and Red (1974). Following Red, an exhausted Fripp declared \"King Crimson is completely over for ever and ever.\" After a period outside the music industry, Robert Fripp returned to work on solo projects (including Frippertronics and his first solo album, Exposure in 1979) and collaborations with artists such as, Daryll Hall, Blondie, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, David Bowie. In 1981, Fripp reconvened King Crimson along with Adrian Belew (Zappa/Bowie/Talking Heads), Tony Levin (Paul Simon/John Lennon/Peter Gabriel) and his old sparring partner, Bill Bruford. \"The bleak Crim view lightened\" according to Fripp as their musical vocabulary widened and Crimson combined gamelan, funk and rock grooves that would threaten to \"tear out and flatten ear hairs within a mile.\" Albums which followed include Discipline (1981), Beat (1982) and Three Of A Perfect Pair (1984) and a stunning live album from their last ever performance in 1984, Absent Lovers (finally released in 1998). Following a lengthy period outside the music industry mainstream - during which Fripp not only established Guitar Craft, engaged in a protracted but ultimately successful legal battle with his former mangers, and collaborated with David Sylvian\u2014King Crimson re-emerged in 1994 with Trey Gunn (touch guitar) and Pat Mastelotto (drums). Joining forces with Belew, Levin, Bruford and Fripp and dubbed the Double Trio, they recorded an ep VROOOM (1994) and THRAK (1995) and a suite of live improvs, THRaKaTTaK (1996). In 1997, the group subdivided into research and development units collectively known as the ProjeKcts, producing an exciting and inventive blend that mixed hard-core improv and electronica (King Crimson The ProjeKcts box set 1999). With Tony Levin temporarily leaving to work with Seal and Peter Gabriel, and Bill Bruford returning full-time to his ongoing Earthworks jazz group, King Crimson entered the new millennium with The ConstruKction of Light (2000). In the same year the double duo of Belew, Fripp Gunn and Mastelotto produced a live set, Heavy ConstruKction, before returning to the studio to record the critically acclaimed, The Power To Believe (2003). After a tour playing 21 countries with over 70 dates, Trey Gunn departed to pursue his own career in 2003. In 2008, a newly reconfigured King Crimson, including Adrian Belew (guitar, lead vocals), Robert Fripp (guitar), Tony Levin (bass guitar & Chapman stick) and Pat Mastelotto (drums) and Gavin Harrison played a short tour of the USA\u2019s East Coast ahead of the band\u2019s 40th anniversary. Although the band is currently on hiatus as Fripp has observed \u201cKing Crimson lives in different bodies at different times and the particular form which the group takes changes. When music appears, which only King Crimson can play then, sooner or later, King Crimson appears to play the music.\u201d", "otherInfo": "H-E-B Center encourages patrons to wear a mask when attending one of our events but masks are not mandatory for entry.

Born and raised in Virginia Beach, VA, she spent her early years on the Chesapeake Bay. Her young parents possessed a large vinyl collection; Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Motown, Funk to Disco, was a constant in the house.

I loved that album for their harmonies. Looking back it's so fitting that I would sing that song.

It was in L.A. where she co-founded and fronted Peculiar Boogie with Rebekah Coltman (guitar) & Susan Joyner (keys) for a decade.

The band played and showcased at some of L.A\u2019s hot spots such as Troubadour, and the Roxy. Robben Ford, Koko Taylor, and Big Brother and the Holding Company are some of the acts that Peculiar Boogie supported. The band received air play in California and Europe regularly.

Gabe Marshall and Bryon White met for a weekly gig that soon attracted all kinds of characters playing various instruments. These sessions quickly attracted a crowd, a semi-stable line-up was formed, and The Damn Quails were born. The band released their first record in 2011 entitled \u201cDown The Hatch\u201d. Since then, the band has firmly established itself as a touring entity hell bent on spreading their brand of music as far as possible. The Damn Quails carry on the great Oklahoma tradition of songwriting that draws from countless genres and has produced many memorable songs, bands, singers, and moments. They are proud to be part of such a rich musical heritage. They have taken their cue from their musical predecessors and forged their own and style that they loosely refer to Folk Rock. From the beginning Bryon and Gabe have had Thomas Young as their drummer. Not only does he keep the beat, but he also serves as a very stabilizing character that provides a very solid foundation on which the guys have built their musical monuments. Joining them playing a vast array of instruments is Kevin \u201cHaystack\u201d Foster. Kevin is a brilliant musician and singer who adds a dimension to the show that is undeniable. It seems like he has been there forever. On bass you have a close friend of Kevin\u2019s and a ball of positivity and energy known as Dillon Sampson. Dillon and Kevin attended South Plains College in Texas where they studied music. They are proud to bring their friendship and dedication to great playing to The Damn Quails. Upon its release \u201cDown the Hatch\u201d quickly became a favorite of both music critics and a growing legion of fans that is now refereed to as \u201cThe Covey\u201d. The record spawned the radio singles \u201cFool\u2019s Gold\u201d, \u201cSo So Long\u201d, and \u201cMe and the Whiskey\u201d. Just as the band was hitting its stride, they suddenly found themselves in a legal struggle with their management company and record label. The situation soon deteriorated in such a way that lawsuits were filed and the band found itself fighting to keep the rights to their own name, music, likeness, and everything associated with The Damn Quails. The band did the only thing it could do and continued to tour and spread the good word the only way they knew how, by playing live. Night after night the band made friends and fans across the country. For much of this time they had no CDs or t-shirts to sell to help keep themselves going. All they could do was play. This situation would have destroyed most bands, but The Quails chose to never give up. They had their music, themselves, and of course The Covey to help them along their way. After two years the lawsuit was finally settled. The band was given the ownership of the name The Damn Quails, and was finally allowed to record and release new music. Finding themselves without a label or any financial backing, the band turned to the people whose support had never wavered, The Covey. They started a Kickstarter Campaign in January of 2015 that raised almost $55,000 dollars to record their new record. They enlisted David Abeyta from Reckless Kelly to produce the record which they recorded in Austin, Texas at 12th Street Sound. They emerged with \u201cOut of the Birdcage\u201d which will be released on their own label Swomp Fyst Records on September 4th. The title signifies the freedom the band feels having finally emerged to follow their true path, a path where they own their own future and are in charge of their own destiny.

The new set of seven emotionally charged songs, produced by Grammy-winner Steve Jordan (Robert Cray, Jon Mayer, Buddy Guy), connects listeners with the Texas vocal powerhouse in her most honest effort to date. She\u2019s dedicated the lively confessional \u201cto all who wander.\u201d From the album\u2019s torrid opener, \u201cLove Revolution,\u201d to the euphoric closer \u201cSong Don\u2019t Fail Me Now,\u201d The Walk demonstrates a heartfelt testament that music can absolutely heal the spirit. It\u2019s a fearless, funny, insightful Bishop we encounter on a path that found her moving from Nashville back to her native Texas, writing an album that captures a seasoned singer/songwriter rediscovering her passion and musical purpose. It\u2019s a liberating collection of songs she calls her \u201cbreakaway.\u201d \u201cThe words are from my soul and the music keeps my feet moving,\u201d says Bonnie. \u201cFor that I am most grateful.\u201d  Framing each of the album\u2019s songs in one-word definitions (such as PURPOSE for \u201cLove Revolution,\u201d and DOUBT for the moving title track), Bonnie captures life\u2019s contradictions and conflicts with an unblinking, no-holding-back approach. Jordan\u2019s groove-laden production completes the compact she made with herself to flourish outside of her comfort zone. \u201cI always wanted to work with him,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew he was perfect for this project because I knew he would create lively beats that made deeper songs like this connect on an upbeat level, as well. I was taking a journey into the unknown and he was there with me every step of the way.\u201d  Bishop began playing original music in dive bars and honky-tonks across her native Texas after graduating from the University of Texas with a degree in Sociology. She moved to Nashville in 2008, sharpening her songwriting chops with writers Mike Reid, Jimmy Wallace, Al Anderson among others. Her big break came when Bonnie Raitt recorded a song she and Anderson wrote entitled \u201cNot Cause I Wanted To,\u201d helping snag a Grammy for Best Americana Album in 2013. In all, Bishop has recorded eight albums, rising though the country/Americana ranks and receiving various awards for her songwriting. A few years ago she decided to take a hiatus from the stress of the music business and enrolled in Sewanee University of the South, where she is currently working toward a master\u2019s degree in creative writing.  In 2016, Thirty Tigers convinced her to record a new album with producer David Cobb, the universally acclaimed Ain\u2019t Who I Was, which brought her back with a splash and showcased the more soulful side of the dynamic singer. Bonnie also dedicates herself to a cause that \u201cwalks the walk\u201d when it comes to turning music into redemptive, life-changing transformation for others, and calls her work with Songwriting With Soldiers the most fulfilling part of her life as a songwriter. This non-profit organization pairs professional songwriters with veterans and active duty military, using collaborative songwriting to build creativity, connections, and strengths. Bonnie recently performed some of the songs she has written with veterans as part of a Songwriting With Soldiers PBS concert at Nashville\u2019s War Memorial Auditorium, which aired this Fall and continues to run on U.S. public access.

In college, Manzy was introduced to the sounds of The Band, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Tom Petty, and Jason Boland. Inspired, he picked up a guitar and soon began playing, writing, and performing.

His third album, Warm Wine, is a collection of stories ranging from sweet to difficult times or a cross between the two. Produced and recorded by David Beck at Fast Horse Studios, Warm Wine is due to be released in the summer of 2018. Faced with the difficulty of categorizing his own music, Manzy asks that you give a listen and decide for yourself. Manzy has opened for popular bands including Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Dean Dillon, Hayes Carll, Corb Lund, Shane Smith and the Saints. He has shared the stage with The Tallent Brothers, The Possum Posse, Doug Moreland, and Mike and the Moonpies. In 2014, Manzy was accepted into The Last Honky Tonk Music Series.

His cross-cultural stew blends cumbias, vamp, salsa, surf, reggae, blues, and Latin-tinged polkas. It has been a long road, coming from Dumas,Texas, a dusty little west Texas town where in the 7th grade he started playing in garage bands. In his late teens, he was often lured to the beaches in Southern Mexico and was drawn to the Mexican music he was hearing around him. Back in Texas he joined up with future members of the Texas Tornados and formed a band known as Joe King Carrasco & El Molino and in 1978 released his 1st LP titled \u201cTex-Mex Rock & Roll\u201d. Somehow this record made its way to England and was re-released by Big Beat Records. In 1979, he formed Joe King Carrasco and the Crowns featuring Vox organ-driven Tex-Mex pop. The Crowns, released their first single, \u201cParty Weekend\u201d, and the label chase began and soon the band was playing chic New York venues and generating lines around the block. The band became one of the first American groups signed to England's legendary Stiff Records. During this time Joe toured extensively throughout Europe, Central America, Bolivia and Columbia as well as across the USA and Canada, consistently delivering high energy performances where dancing was the numero uno priority. Rounding out his assault on the International music scene with an in-depth interview in Rolling Stone Magazine and an appearance performing his music on Saturday Night Live. His song \u201cParty Weekend\u201d which is still known as the quintessential party anthem, was re-released by MTV as Party Christmas, making Joe King Carrasco a household name to MTV viewers across the country. Even with all this going on Joe knew he was ready to take his music to a new level. It was on the Stiff Records, Sons of Stiff Tour, while traveling with a British-born Jamaican band called The Equators, that Joe picked up much of his reggae influence. After returning from a very successful year on the road, he put this experience to work and recorded the reggae flavored song \"Don't Let a Woman (Make a Fool Out of You)\" on his album Synapse Gap for MCA Records where he had the King of pop, Michael Jackson, singing background harmonies. Joe's music is enhanced with an even greater Latin influence after living and studying in Nicaragua in the mid 1980's. His songs dealt with the unjust political situation of that period in Central America, and the resulting albums were; \"Bordertown\", \"Bandido Rock\" (off of which the song \"Pachucco Hop\" was recorded by the French group Mano Negra, headed up by Manu Chao, on their first platinum selling CD), and \"Royal Loyal & Live\" (with the only live recording of the hit song \u201cParty Weekend\u201d). Several years ago, His Majesty took a few left turns at Nogales and wound up playing with his band at a bar called Pancho y Lefty's in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. There, the Tex-Mex fell into a slow cool cumbia/reggae groove. This style seemed to be the musical answer to what Joe had been searching for from the Mayan pyramids to the shores of Lake Titicaca. This mystical combination of Latino and Caribbean, with a little bit of Sam The Sham thrown in for a spicy flavor, has evolved into a style Joe has termed \"Tequila Reggae\". This influence can be heard on several of his recordings including \u201cDia de Los Muertos\u201d, \u201cHot Sun\u201d, and \u201cHay Te Guacho Cucaracho\u201d. In early 1996 Joe\u2019s song \u201cTell Me\u201d was recorded by The Texas Tornados, and sung by Freddy Fender, on their CD \u20184 Aces\u2019. His music has been placed on numerous movie soundtracks including \u201cBreathless\u201d with Richard Gere, James Gardners' \u201cRockford Files\u201d, and he also played on the \u2018Tin Cup\u2019 sound track. Joe King Carrasco has been involved in acting for many years but in 2009 he stepped into the roles of writer and director with the release of his first film \"Rancho No Tengo\". The soundtrack with the same name was released in 2008. Because dogs are such an important part of his life, in 2011, Joe along with his three Jack Russell Terriers who go everywhere he goes, started a nonprofit group, Viva Perros (www.vivaperros.org) which helps homeless, abused and neglected dogs find a better life. Part of the profits from the \u201cConcierto Para Los Perros\u201d CD and T-shirts are donated to dog rescue groups via Viva Perros. Through the years, fans have always been impressed by the energy Joe King Carrasco brings to the show with antics such as climbing up onto the speakers, taking leaps off the drum rise and closing the gap between him and the audience by taking his guitar through the crowd and climbing onto tables and bars without missing a beat. There were times when he amazed everyone by climbing above the audience and doing a full flip landing on the audience. Joe King Carrasco was awarded in both 1979 and 1983, The Buddy Award for Best Latin Artist. In 2003, Joe King Carrasco was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame and in 2012 Joe was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame for a second time with his band The Crowns. The Academy of Texas Music awarded Joe King Carrasco a Lifetime Achievement Award in March of 2012, and he gave them a taste of his endless energy when he played as the closing act at the award ceremonies running through the audience only to end up back on stage taking a leap from the 4 foot drum rise while still playing his guitar. Down in Mexico, Joe was voted best lead guitar in Puente Perula, Jalisco. In March of 2013, Joe was honored with the Entertainer of the Year Award by the Academy of Texas Music along with a Historical Significance Award. In June of 2011, Joe King Carrasco reunited with the original Crowns, and spent the summer playing across Texas. Teamed up with organist/accordionist Kris Cummings, bassist Brad Kizer, and drummer Mike Navarro, they went back to the studio and recorded a new CD, \u201cQue Wow\u201d, which they released during the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas in March of 2012. Joe King Carrasco landed back in the studio late 2012 - this time with Ernie Durawa, Speedy Sparks and Augie Meyers, three members of his first band, El Molino and recorded a new CD, \u2018Tlaquepaque\u2019. They brought in many Texas MVP musicians to play on this LP, including Marcello Gauna, Aaron Lack, Jimmy Shortell, Jesse Dayton, John X Reed, Gil Herman, Chuggy Hernandez, Joe Morales, and Lisa York. When not touring, Joe King Carrasco can be found at his musical home in Puerto Vallarta, Nacho Daddy, a Mex-Tex restaurant and club with walls tapered with memories, such as posters and photographs of Joes' musical history and travels around the world. Holding court at Nacho Daddy gives Joe King a palace to rock his Tex-Mex and transport those who drink the magic flavored \"margaritas\" to a place where the \"Party Weekend\" goes on forever. Joe King Carrasco, with over 24 albums to his name, now spends much of his spare time writing music and relentlessly searching for the perfect desolate beach to hang out with his dogs. He can often be found exploring the twisty back roads from Coahuila all the way to Chiapas, chasing down good inspiration for another Tex-Mex song.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1260 S Business, New Braunfels, TX 78130", "Artist": "Dallas Burrow ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11110132.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.6885215, -98.1297816], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Folk", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Johnny Chops w/ Dallas Burrow at The Redbird Listening Room", "moreBioInfo": "A Texas-born Americana artist rooted in the tradition of his home state's songwriting heroes, Dallas Burrow built a career on both sides of the Atlantic with his 2019 debut, Southern Wind.

From a young age I grew up being very well rounded in the arts. I studied dancing, singing, acting, and martial arts to name a few. As a teenager, I traveled all over the country competing in various entertainment competitions, coming in as national champion 4x for my dance routines. At 15, I joined a country western swing dance group known as the \"Elite Wranglers\". Being on this team introduced me to the amazing world of country music. My obsession with this genre quickly grew! After attending my first country concert (Brad Paisley), I knew I had found my forever passion. Shortly thereafter, I took up guitar to grow my arsenal of skills. I am currently traveling all over Texas performing live shows or doing radio interviews. My original songs \u201cLong Overdue\u201d and \u201cGotta Be Bad\u201d have all landed spots on the Texas Country Music Chart, placing within the top 60, and within the top three new release downloads on the CDTEX download chart. Thank you for your support during my journey. I hope to see you at my next show!", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2906 Fruth St, Austin, TX 78705", "Artist": "Gilded Lows ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10221273.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2953157, -97.74205219999999], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "Dream Pop, Gothic Americana, Cowboy, Americana, Post Punk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Spiderhouse Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2906 Fruth St, Austin, TX 78705", "Artist": "We Are Blood Bays ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7349093.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2953157, -97.74205219999999], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "American Noir, Southern Gotchic", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Spiderhouse Ballroom", "moreBioInfo": "Based in Austin, TX We Are Blood Bays creates original music that forms soundtracks to the movies playing on the reel-to-reel projectors in their minds.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1281 Gruene Rd, New Braunfels, TX 78130", "Artist": "Lucas Hudgins ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [29.7383197, -98.1044616], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Gruene Hall", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "5902 Pace Bend Rd N, Spicewood, TX 78669", "Artist": "Yancy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9009026.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.4671291, -98.00787779999999], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Highland Lakes Camp & Conference Center", "moreBioInfo": "With over a decade under her belt in creative circles, Yancy\u2019s fingerprints have found their way onto a variety of projects that suggests she has an insatiable appetite to explore, while serving as an ingenious study in contrasts along the way. From her high-energy worship projects for kids and her new adult-focused worship album, Yancy\u2019s musical influence is inspiring the entire family to worship, learn and rejoice in the Lord. Comb through Yancy\u2019s credits and you will find her exploring a variety of projects and genres, including a series of pop/rock releases, a Christmas collection and multiple CD and DVD releases. She has toured with acts like Newsboys, Mute Math and Nichole Nordeman; while on the writing side of the coin, she\u2019s teamed up with Third Day\u2019s Mac Powell, co-penned Avalon\u2019s chart topping \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Go\u201d (off the Grammy nominated Oxygen album) and Jaci Velesquez\u2019s acclaimed \u201cSomething Beautiful,\u201d while still finding the time to compose devotional books for worship leaders and musicians as well as one for her pre-teen audience. She even launched a father/daughter-speaking event with her dad and veteran minister, Jim Wideman. Add in five years as a staff worship leader conducting services for every age group imaginable, and Yancy has literally run the entire gamut of enthusiastic diversification. \u201cI knew from a very young age that God had called me to make music with my life. Although I was very confident of that calling growing up, I couldn\u2019t imagine the amazing journey God has taken me on that would be a part of fulfilling that calling,\u201d reflects Yancy. Her latest project, \u201cRoots For The Journey,\u201d is coming to stores on May 21st via distribution partner Elevate Entertainment. \u201cRoots for the Journey is incredibly different musically from what I\u2019ve done these past few years,\u201d says Yancy about the album. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this music that is unplugged, organic and simple. The songs are all based on scripture and the outcome is a really nice chilled-out worship experience that I know adults are going to really enjoy. There will be a companion app that helps parents teach these scriptures and Biblical truths to their children which will be a cool resource for the family.\u201d Inspired to extend her musical influence to the parents and church leaders her children focused-music has equipped over the years, Yancy\u2019s adult-focused album, \u201cRoots For The Journey\u201d was born out of an organic process that caught her by surprise. Yancy explains, \u201cI started off making this a lullaby CD. Taking key scriptures and truths that I wanted to pass on to my son and make sure he knew and understood the direction and answer these scriptures provide us. As I worked in the studio, I realized that the music was shaping up to be way more than lullabies. Already, when I meet people in my life that are facing big mountains, fears or need answers I\u2019ve been able to use these songs as a way to help strengthen their faith and help them meditate on what God\u2019s Word says. I can\u2019t wait to see how God uses these songs to strengthen the faith of those young and old.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Lead worship for camp."}, {"Address": "310 W Willie Nelson Blvd, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Jonny Lang ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7804151.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2652496, -97.7470749], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "R&b & Soul, Rock & Pop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Jonny Lang (born Jon Gordon Langseth, Jr. in Fargo, North Dakota, January 29, 1981) is an American blues guitarist and singer. Compared to peers like Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band and Chris Duarte, who have failed in meeting or exceeding their critics expectations, Lang continues to grow as a musician. In 1995 (at the age of 14) his first album, Smokin\u2019 by Kid Jonny Lang & The Big Bang was released. As a result of the LP becoming a regional hit, a major-label bidding war ensued that culminated in Lang signing to A&M Records in 1996. In 1997 (at the age of 15) his major-label debut, Lie to Me, was released to mixed reviews. Part of his success is due to a voice that sounds like that of 40 year-old blues veteran, containing a harshness tempered by a fine falsetto that has taken prominence in his newest albums. Another part of his success is his scorching, electrifying guitar solos, which display a prodigious natural talent honed by years of practice and playing. Whatever the secret to his success, the youngster has quickly become a fixture in the blues world, drawing crowds wherever he goes. Lang has drawn deeply from the wellspring of influences from the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert King, Luther Allison, and Albert Collins. As he becomes more confident in his role as a veteran instead of a boy wonder, one can see the possibilities he has yet to share with his fans.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "12010 Manchaca Rd, Austin, TX 78748", "Artist": "Big John ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.1438891, -97.833587], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "Hip-hop, Rap, Hip Hop", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Giddy Ups", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2008 Congress Ave S, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "MIKE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11439849.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.243677, -97.75225929999999], "Date": "2021-08-01", "EventDate": "Aug. 1st, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "C-boy's Heart & Soul", "moreBioInfo": "At twenty-two years old, MIKE's age can be deceiving. He is an integral figure in birthing a new sound and style of hip hop that has gained wide influence since it first broke in underground circles in 2017, and MIKE's music itself carries the insight, pain, and fatigue that often comes with age and long life lived. Born in New Jersey, MIKE moved to London with his mother before settling in The Bronx for the remainder of his later teenage years. Both regions have had an audible influence on the young rapper's music - in England he was immersed in grime and the music of King Krule, and in the United States he was turned on to Earl Sweatshirt and MF DOOM. In New York, MIKE connected with several artists who had a similar ear and style, and formed a collective called [sLUms]. Consisting of Ad\u00e9 Hakim, Darryl Johnson, King Carter, Jazz Jodi, and DJ Mason, the group established a unique sound that created waves throughout underground hip hop circles across the country. In 2017 MIKE released his mixtape May God Bless Your Hustle. The project perfectly captured a singular moment in a city where the only constant is change. With features from Standing on the Corner, Wiki, Mal Devisa, and more, as well as production from Ade Hakim, Tony Seltzer, and Austin Williamson of Onyx Collective, May God Bless Your Hustle was a snapshot of the sound of underground New York rap in 2017. It received a Best New Music review from Pitchfork as MIKE started to gain international attention outside of New York City. At the end of 2018 MIKE released his album War In My Pen independently, and followed it up in mid 2019 with Tears of Joy, his second album to be selected for Pitchfork\u2019s Best New Music. He released his most recent album, Weight of the World, in 2020. Nearly entirely self-produced, and only containing features from Jadasea and Earl Sweatshirt, it\u2019s one of MIKE\u2019s most introspective and sonically diverse releases to date. MIKE has opened tours for Blood Orange and Earl Sweatshirt, and performed at festivals such as MoMA PS1 Warm Up, Pitchfork Festival, and Capitol Hill Block Party. Over the past year MIKE immersed himself in electronic and house music, listening to artists such as Steve Spacek and Park Hye Jin. He released two largely instrumental projects partially inspired by these new influences: BLP2020 \u201cKing of the Night\u201d and BLP2021 \"for ur own good.\" Disco! is the first MIKE release since Weight of the World, and sees MIKE combine his new style of production with his top tier songwriting and delivery. The project is at times more upbeat and catchy than his previous work, but still carries the emotional weight that is characteristic of MIKE's music. The result is MIKE's most engaging and interesting body of work to date, as he continues to evolve the style of rap that he pioneered.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}]
