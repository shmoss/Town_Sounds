From there both stories, of nation and artist, sweep westward, drawing from new surroundings, absorbing what each station on their way has to offer. America\u2019s journey is still underway. But in a sense Chuck Shaw has found what he was looking for: a place where he can put down roots and nurture his unique artistry. For Shaw, that place is, as someone once crooned, deep in the heart of Texas. He\u2019s been there for just a few years but that\u2019s time enough for him to know he has come home. With his love for old-school country music, his ability to write songs nourished by that tradition and sing them with rare expression, this is where he has always belonged. \u201cEven when I was in high school back in New Jersey, I knew I was probably going to end up in Texas,\u201d he reflects. \u201cAnd later, when I was in Colorado and Wyoming, friends kept telling me, \u2018You need to move to Texas. You sound like you belong there. That\u2019s where the real stuff is.\u2019\u201d The \u201creal stuff\u201d is country music that\u2019s about substance, not style. All you need to do is listen to his self-titled debut album to know it\u2019s true. It\u2019s in the raunch, grit and swagger of \u201cDirty Woman Creek,\u201d the neon glow and greasy groove of \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time,\u201d the morning-after cobwebs and cold daylight that color \u201cHope I Can Get Through Today\u201d We could go through all 12 tracks, up to the handclaps and gospel affirmation of \u201cRise Up,\u201d each one written by Shaw except for his striking rendition of \u201cLong Black Veil\u201d and little-known gem \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time.\u201d Like so many good things in life, it goes by fast and easy and then lingers until it\u2019s cued up again. This is Lone Star country \u2014 but the deeper you listen, the more hints you hear of the path he took to reach that destination. In his first single, \u201cBurn That Oil,\u201d the harmonica riff and nostalgic reminiscence might bring Springsteen to mind. Shaw wouldn\u2019t deny it, being born and raised through high school in New Jersey. But even in his formative years, with his friends immersed mainly in rap, Shaw felt the call of country, first from groups like The Eagles and Creedence Clearwater Revival. \u201cA lot of the rock I grew up with had country roots,\u201d he says. \u201cThen one day in high school, after I\u2019d gotten my heart broken, I bought the John Fogerty album Blue Ridge Rangers, where he covered a bunch of country songs including \u2018She Thinks I Still Care.\u2019 That song really spoke to me. And through the album as a whole I discovered George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and all the others who would influence me so much.\u201d After getting his first electric guitar at age 13, Shaw formed a band \u2014 probably the only one in his part of the Garden State that featured a country fiddle player. He started writing songs too. The more he crafted his style, the more determined he was to seek inspiration out west, the cradle of the music he had come to love. So after graduation, he headed out to the Rocky Mountains to study creative writing at Colorado College. Equally important, he honed his vocal and instrumental chops with the school\u2019s celebrated Bluegrass Ensemble, an education that included three appearances at the Durango Bluegrass Meltdown. Eventually, after working for a couple of summers on a ranch in Wyoming and then spending a year in Arizona that included four months on the road with the country/rock band Mostly Water, Shaw made his pilgrimage to Nashville. With money he\u2019d saved from Mostly Water, he recorded an EP and, in the summer of 2015, started playing in Music City\u2019s fabled honky-tonks. Nights of grinding out country hits in touristy dives sharpened his performance skills. It also cued him when it was time to get out of town. \u201cIt was exciting at first,\u201d Shaw remembers. \u201cIt taught me how to interact with the crowd, how to get people excited. And there were some great singers and players down there. But I started hating it after a while because I just couldn\u2019t stand to play mainstream pop/country day and night, over and over again. Even songs that I loved got beaten to death. There was so little originality.\u201d And so Shaw embarked on the last stage of his Odyssey, this time to San Marcos late in 2016. Since then, he went from finding a place to live in a town filled with strangers to building up friends and followers through open-mike nights and paying gigs throughout Central Texas. \u201cI fought hard to play anywhere I could,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if meant annoying the heck out of club owners, I did what I had to do to get my name out there.\u201d Persistence has paid off and put this young man square in the spotlight as one of traditional country\u2019s most promising new talents. Chuck Shaw makes that more than clear \u2014 and for those who somehow still don\u2019t get the message, he\u2019s happy to lay it all out in plain Texan: \u201cThe music I love is real,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s pure. It\u2019s a great American art form. I love how it sounds \u2014 the fiddle, the pedal steel \u2014 and how it feels. They know that down where I live, but when I play somewhere else, where people only know that mainstream pop country, I explain to them: This is how we do it in Texas. \u201cThis is country music.\u201d -30-", "otherInfo": "Acoustic"}, {"Address": "4041 FM 32, Fischer, TX 78623", "Artist": "Conjunto Los Pinkys ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [29.9338755, -98.1531029], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "1:00 PM", "Venue": "Devils Backbone Tavern", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "with special guest Susan Torres"}, {"Address": "76 Rainey St, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "JD Casper ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11363108.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2588866, -97.7389755], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative, Folk, Americana, Rock, Indie", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Unbarlievable", "moreBioInfo": "www.jdcasper.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3700 Bell Springs Rd, Dripping Springs, TX 78620", "Artist": "Nathan Hinojosa ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/4665638.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2389708, -98.12586879999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Bell Springs Winery", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "8504 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78745", "Artist": "Ben Balmer ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11549655.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.1726942, -97.7856709], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country, Contemporary Folk, Americana, Folk, Blues", "Time": "2:30 PM", "Venue": "Ben Balmer & Josh Flowers @Far Out Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "Ben Balmer is an Austin-based singer/songwriter whose talent and way with words has taken him touring all over the world.

Born and raised in Sedona, The Watters developed their eclectic sound after living in several dramatically different cities including Los Angeles, Denver, Nashville and now Austin. Seamlessly blending Americana, Soul, Rock and Jazz, they have been described as \u201cFleetwood Mac with a horn section.\u201d Daniel and Jenna Watters have collaborated on seven albums together under various monikers, and they released their debut record, GREAT UNKNOWN, as \u201cThey Watters\u201d in 2016. They have garnered a devoted fan base through their energetic performances, stirring vocals and road-weathered musicianship. For The Watters, life and music are one, their journey together being their greatest muse. With fifteen years of music collaboration together, husband and wife duo Daniel & Jenna Watters embrace a sound they call \u201cAmericana Soul\u201d. Aided by some of Austin\u2019s finest musicians, The Watters is full of the rich experience and expert contributions of everyone involved. Lively horn riffs and lingering vocal melodies serve as a cornerstone for the new album, which features well-crafted songwriting, the electric energy of a live performance and unique genre that is both indefinably new yet always familiar. The Watters became an Austin band in 2015. \u201cOn one of our trips home to Sedona,\u201d says Daniel, \u201cwe were convinced to take a long detour to Austin, TX and ended up at a show at The Continental Club Gallery where we decided that night we had to move here.\u201d Now, after recording two albums and playing relentlessly around Austin for five years, The Watters, whose airtight version of Americana/Soul often elicits comparisons to Fleetwood Mac (to whom they\u2019ve been known to play Tribute shows around ATX), Tedeschi Trucks Band, and Rilo Kiley, have won a major grant from local music non-profit Blackfret and are preparing to release their new album Intuition on January 23rd, 2021. Intuition\u2019s primary genre is heavy and/or profound lyrics delivered with buoyancy and amusement. Horns and organs trill around sharp corners. Perfectly executed harmonies and immaculate vocals envelop the tracks in a warmth that often belies the lyrical content. That duality is life, if you\u2019re lucky, and it\u2019s what The Watters excel at. Intuition was recorded live over five days at Good Danny\u2019s Studio (Sheerwater, Wye Oak, Of Montreal) in Lockhart, TX in October 2019. It features JJ Johnson (Tedeschi Trucks Band) on drums, Anthony Farrell (Greyhounds) on Organ, Trevor Nealon (Band of Heathens) on Keys, and Joe Beckham on Bass. Horns and vocals were overdubbed at Birdhouse Studios and background vocals were recorded during Covid-19 lockdown.

And he\u2019s putting it to good use with the release of his second solo album, Certain Circles, his first full-length record in nearly a decade. A lifelong Texan, Gassaway studied music composition and theory in college, honing his skills as a composer by creating works for a wide range of ensembles from choirs to full orchestras, as well as composing the score to short film Take Two. He has also been trained in classical guitar and voice, and plays a variety of instruments from banjolele to reed organ. His training, and the onstage lessons he\u2019s learned as a solo performer and member of groups such as Canaries in the Coal Mine and formally the Matchmaker Band, has resulted in multi-textured pop songs that recall the Head & the Heart and Ben Folds. In a Chase Gassaway song, it\u2019s not unusual to hear strings, horns, woodwinds and piano accompanying Gassaway\u2019s engaging lyrics and slightly husky vocals, which might remind listeners of Jakob Dylan\u2019s. Married to his college sweetheart, Gassaway rarely writes about the trials and tribulations of relationships. Instead, he prefers to use his music as a means to explore the inner workings of the human spirit, call for social justice and hope, and encourage people to \u201cask questions they never thought to ask.\u201d The result is an album that\u2019s both insightful and inspirational. Certain Circles has been a work of optimism since its Kickstarter campaign genesis. While Gassaway does get pensive on \u201cBreak of Dawn,\u201d the introspective and rootsy \u201cWhere I\u2019m Coming From,\u201d and the poignant piano ballad \u201cThe Ship,\u201d the overarching theme of the record is hope. The opening track, \u201cTurn This Thing Around,\u201d is a buoyant, horn-heavy tune that offers a positive outlook for the future while serving as a plea for people to find common ground and love one another. The banjo licks and group singalong anchoring \u201cFeeling Good\u201d are guaranteed mood-enhancers, and the anthem \u201cHear Love,\u201d which closes the album, is the apotheosis of that hopeful tone. Recorded in six days at Ramble Creek Recording Studio in Austin, most of the album\u2019s 10 tracks were captured in one take. The result is an organic feel perfectly suiting the material, which Gassaway wrote and produced himself. Instead of pigeonholing his music into Americana, folk or alternative categories, Gassaway prefers to pursue diversity and eclecticism. \u201cI\u2019ve written full symphonic works, choral pieces, chamber music and folk songs, and they\u2019re all the same for me,\u201d he explains. \u201cI like to think of my style as \u2018honest.\u2019\u201d SELECTED RECORDING HISTORY Chase Gassaway, Certain Circles, 2014 \u2013 writer, producer, vocals, guitars, ukulele, banjolele, percussion, reed organ, brass/string/wind orchestration; piano on \u201cThe Ship\u201d Jordan Whitmore, Consider It Done, 2013 \u2013 producer, guitars, ukulele, banjolele, harmonica, piano, typewriter, percussion, brass/wind orchestration Jack Burton, Soul, 2013 - vocals Lamar Stockton & The Mourning Doves, Tearing At The Seams, 2012 \u2013 vocals Jordan Whitmore, Fondly, 2012 \u2013 guitar, keys and producer for \u201cBecause He Did\u201d track.

Most clear in my memory, even amid the party that a live music backstage scene can tend to be, Will was the happiest guy in the place \u2013 clearly exactly where he wanted to be, and loving every second. This was a contagious vibe from the outset, one that Will had no trouble channeling into music that rings in the heart of the listener, and a live show as inspiring as it is entertaining. Between two acclaimed and successful albums, 2012\u2019s Rose Queen and 2015\u2019s Ringling Road, and what now clocks in at a near-decade's worth of dogged road work, William Clark Green has established himself as one of the most important voices of his genre - a voice that now pipes up again on his anticipated new album, Hebert Island. Texas is a big place, complete with fully distinct sub-territories - we reserve the right to bust into several states, should that become strategically expedient - and our traveling musical artists tend to become experts on the rich mosaic that makes up Texas' cultural geography. Will has found himself onstage in a growing portion of her 254 counties, and has called several his home; as he puts it, \"I kinda spend six years everywhere\". Childhood northeast in Tyler, high school years in College Station, college years at Texas Tech in Lubbock, early music career years in the north-central hamlet of Eastland, and lately his most urban digs so far, in Fort Worth - but deep down, Will's Cajun roots call to him incessantly, and thus southeast Texas is never far from his mind. The new album is named for Will's retreat at Hebert Island (say \"AY-Bear\", though you'll occasionally hear \"HEE-Bert\") near Beaumont, and refers to the hilltop upon which his camphouse sits - not an actual island, but a potential one, should the occasional flood come to pass; high ground is valuable in this landscape. Will considers himself a \"half-ass coon-ass\" - a distantly-descended Cajun, but one who holds a deep appreciation for that history and that way of life. \"It's a real place\", Will insists, with the feeling that only such a beloved space can foster - his family has owned it since 1869, in the early years of Reconstruction, and is where they established one of the state's first rice farming operations. It's a place that echoes through time for William Clark Green, connecting his family's past and tradition to who he is as an artist, and as a man, today. It's been over three years since Ringling Road. \"I'm not gonna force songs,\" Will sighs. \"We could have finished the record a long time ago, but we didn't like the mixes - we're the bosses, and we don't have to listen to ourselves.\" The pressures and deadlines of the professional recording artist are nothing new, and while he certainly notices that pressure, Will recognizes it to be a good problem to have. \"I remember when no one gave a shit, so yeah, it's incredible to have that want-to. So far, every record I've come out with has been my best record - I wrote my ass off for this one. I wanted to make sure it beat Ringling Road, and I'm not bragging on myself - I just knew it was going to take effort.\" That effort has paid off; Hebert Island is a stellar new batch of songs from a guy who has gone to great lengths to keep his energy focused, through all distraction, on quality songcraft. \"My favorite songwriter is Guy Clark - the songwriter's songwriter. It's what I've always cared about the most...the craft of songs is really where it's at for me. I think good songs are undeniable.\" Mostly recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium with Benjy Davis at the board, the new album also features players who have been backing Will for near the full ride, including guitarist Steven Marcus and bassist Cameron Moreland. \u201cGoner\u201d stands as a shimmering, no-hard-feelings take on the moment of breakup, the protagonist of the quasi-travelogue \u201cStay\u201d understands that it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, as long as you\u2019re close to love, and the ballad \u201cShe Loves Horses\u201d exemplifies both the warmth and strength that\u2019s developed in Will\u2019s songwriting and the performance power of his players. Will's desired contribution to the world is songs that change lives for the better, and he realizes that he's conduit as much as creator for that change. And in spite of - or, perhaps, because of - the demands and pressures of the life he's chosen, and the position of leadership he's earned through a decade of determination, William Clark Green is a guy who takes none of this for granted. \"Our path is guided by something that's greater than me, I believe that. We can be very proud of what we've accomplished; we've done it the right way...I feel very proud of what we've done, and I'm thankful every day for where we're at.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2015 E Riverside Dr Bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741", "Artist": "Grey Feather ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.2400045, -97.7276248], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Come and Take It Live", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Come and Take It Productions presents TEXAS TAKEOVER TOUR: Austin!"}, {"Address": "2015 E Riverside Dr Bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741", "Artist": "Whiskey Fueled Death ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.2400045, -97.7276248], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Come and Take It Live", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Come and Take It Productions presents TEXAS TAKEOVER TOUR: Austin!"}, {"Address": "3003, New Braunfels, TX 78130", "Artist": "Phil Luna ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8935707.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.6775659, -98.1485574], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Blues, Motown, Soul, Pop", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Gruene River Grill", "moreBioInfo": "Thanks for following!

Her influences span generations of blues, country, and rock 'n' roll greats that led her to a unique soulful, country-tinged brand of roots rock 'n' roll. With her 2013 release One More Time Again - and debut as Beth Lee & The Breakups - she began honing in and developing her energetic live performances. Her soulful, heart-on-your-sleeve songwriting style evolved to include a sultry, sassy, rock 'n' roll edge. Her last LP, Keep Your Mouth Shut, released in May 2016, garnered positive reviews from independent radio and roots publications, including a #19 rank on the Americana Music Show's year end list and a flattering review from KUTX's Laurie Gallardo, who coined the sound as \"country-fried rock 'n' soul\". It was also listed in Alternate Root Magazine and Third Coast Music Magazine as one of the year's top picks. Beth is releasing a new album February 12th, Waiting on You Tonight. The LP was produced in the Bay Area by Chuck Prophet & The Mission Express drummer Vicente Rodriguez, and features Rodriguez as well as Chuck Prophet guitarist James DePrato, and multi-instrumentalist Julie Wolf.

When a packed house can sing every word of every song on the set list. When fans drive four hours on a Wednesday to see their favorite band and still have to be at work by 8am. That\u2019s when you know something special is happening. For Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers and their devoted legion of fans, that synergy between band and crowd, happens every night, 150 nights a year. Thier intense touring schedule has made RCPM one of best live rock-n-roll bands in America today. Roger Clyne, drummer PH Naffah, bassist Nick Scropos and lead guitarist Jim Dalton look forward to more sold out clubs, theaters and amphitheatres once they finish their new album set for release in 2021. For Clyne and Naffah, it will be their 11th studio album since 1996 in a career that started with seminal Tempe band The Refreshments and their debut album, \u201cFizzy, Fuzzy, Big & Buzzy\u201d which became a cult classic. It produced the alternative radio hit \u201cBanditos\u201d which had significant airplay on MTV and earned The Refreshments appearances on The Conan O\u2019Brien Show and MTV\u2019s 120 Minutes. As fellow Arizona resident and rock icon Alice Cooper noted in The Refreshments\u2019 feature-length documentary Here\u2019s to Life, \u201cI heard (Banditos) on the radio and I remember, there are certain songs that you turn up. The first time I heard \u2018My Sharona.\u2019 You know, the first time you hear the Nirvana stuff. It was the same thing with this.\u201d The Refreshments can still be heard daily on syndicated TV performing the theme song for the Mike Judge animated TV series, King of Hill. After The Refreshments broke up, Clyne and Naffah found inspiration in Southwest Arizona in jukeboxes still playing the music of Johnny Cash and Marty Robbins along with the bands that influenced Clyne\u2019s youth such as Camper Van Beethoven and They Might Be Giants. The result was the birth of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers. Despite not having the backing of a major record label, RCPM\u2019s first album \u201cHonky Tonk Union,\u201d debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s internet sales chart in 1999. RCPM released eight more albums that landed in the top ten of Billboard\u2019s Internet Sales Chart, including a No. 1 debut for their third album, \u201cAmericano!\u201d In 2019, Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers were inducted into the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame, joining the likes of fellow Arizona legends Alice Cooper, Buck Owens, Glen Campbell, Stevie Nicks, Linda Ronstadt and Waylon Jennings.

Domino is filled with the wandering spirit of a storyteller that\u2019s never content with simply drawing from the tales of others. Over his life, he\u2019s lived in a number of places, some of them such as Frisco, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada, might as well be on different planets for all of the contrasts a perceptive fellow like Domino can tune into. Though he\u2019s also lived in Alabama and Mississippi, a couple of states with a rich musical heritage to rival most states, Domino says Lubbock, Texas, no matter where else has laid his head or worked a job, has been, and always will be home. \u201cI was born in Memphis, and I\u2019ve lived in several spots,\u201d explains Domino. \u201cBut I seem to move every five years, and Lubbock is the place I lived the longest, so that is where I\u2019ll always call home.\u201d Another key driving factor to Domino\u2019s ability to expertly proffer a number of styles that still feel cohesive and thoughtful on 1806 is in the musical upbringing he enjoyed. Whether it was the hymnal singing from his Grandmother, or the 1950\u2019s Sun Records his Grandfather would play, Domino soaked it all in \u2013 even the heavy metal his own step-father would often listen too. Indeed, Domino\u2019s formative youth was somewhat unusual, and as a result, his musical choices of the past, might seem strange, given the powerfully grizzled way he can deliver a sage line of West Texas wisdom now. Whether it\u2019s gothic western of \u201cHowl,\u201d the rocking roadhouse vibe of \u201cDallas,\u201d the sawdust shuffling, rootsy ode to an inspirational women \u201cJesus and Handbags,\u201d or the menacing, swampy, stomping \u201cKilling Floor,\u201d the tunes on 1806 fit well, and offer the listener a well-rounded, satisfying experience. For good measure, \u201cAll that Matters\u201d is suited for country radio with its delicate electricity, declarations of a pleading lover, and Domino\u2019s ability to simply tell a story we can all relate to, yet can\u2019t express in the same way. Two key moments as Domino traveled the oft-difficult path from adolescence into his teenage years proved to be the foundation from which he would build his identity as a musician with something personal and unique to say. Even in Junior high, Domino recognized music was the way in which he could best express what his soul wrestled with. \u201cA big musical moment for me was in 2003, when I went to a punk show in Las Vegas,\u201d Domino clearly recalls. \u201cNew Found Glory and MXPX were playing, which was perfect because I had grown up skateboarding and hearing the live bands at the Van\u2019s Warped Tour. Punk music really was my base, because I loved the freedom of the lyrics. The songs dealt with the stuff that was relevant to me. The older I\u2019ve become, the more I\u2019ve enjoyed that same freedom I see in the writing of so many great Texas and Red Dirt artists. The feeling I get from great lyrics is what will has always stuck out to me.\u201d Shortly after Domino\u2019s punk-tinted epiphany, his Grandfather passed away, and at the age of 14, Domino began to explore the depths of personally vulnerable songwriting in order to cope with the loss of the man that had raised him for the first 10 years of his life. Over the years, Domino has kept the fuel for creating original music from his own viewpoint burning on high. With musical heroes ranging from Lubbock legend Terry Allan, to Bright Eyes, to another young singer-songwriter with West Texas ties, Charlie Shafter, its clear Domino wants his music to hit the listener in both the gut and the mind, just as his favorite artists\u2019 best tunes always manage to. \u201cEvery song I have was about a specific moment or a period of time,\u201d Domino explains. \u201cI can\u2019t just make up a song. I have to live in it, or I have to relive the emotions I felt in my life at the moment the song requires.\u201d Domino's tragic and triumphant travels through musical and geographical terrain have led to this moment where he\u2019s a man with serious things to say, as music is the one true way he can fully express it all to us.

Packed with soul and grit, his tunes are radiant with infectious guitar melodies, rollicking rhythms and nostalgic poetry. Marshall channels his fresh, frank views on love, loss, self-discovery and moving on through his gravelly voice seasoned with a drop of sweetness. A generous and engaging performer, he connects to audiences through his energetic live shows, inviting them into his expressive inner world. Marshall\u2019s solo debut, Sinners and Saints features six heartfelt songs that bloom from a place of deep honesty and real-world experience. Produced by two-time Grammy nominee Travis Wyrick (Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels, Shinedown) in Knoxville, the material on the EP flowed out of Marshall when he moved to Nashville after the brutal end of a long-time romance. The album is brimming with heartbreak and hope and shows his growth as a songwriter as well as his ability to glide through many musical styles, including modern and retro country, rock, folk and everything in between. A passion for music has coursed through Marshall\u2019s veins since his childhood split between rural West Virginia and North Carolina; he hails from three generations of accomplished musicians and singers. He came up listening to country radio hits by artists such as Restless Heart, Lonestar, George Strait and John Michael Montgomery, often while riding around in his uncle\u2019s truck. On New Year\u2019s Day when he was 16-years old, he discovered his father\u2019s old bass guitar in a closet and started learning to play it while experimenting with throwing together his own lyrics. Before long, he was seeking out concerts with friends, playing in bands and putting poetry to music, embracing that he was fated to be a country singer/songwriter. Marshall has already garnered many accomplishments as a musician. He has played bass and sung in both rock and country groups, played thousands of shows and recorded half a dozen studio albums. He has released singles that have charted in the top 10 on R&R charts. Marshall also supported country artist Jody Lee Petty on bass, touring the southeast and opening for nationally-known acts including Colt Ford, Josh Thompson, Justin Moore and David Allen Coe. Drawing inspiration from great country crooners such as Travis Meadows, Jason Isbell, Chris Stapleton and Dierks Bentley, who are capable of painting vivid pictures with words, Marshall is now boldly embarking on a solo career and preparing for the official release of Sinners and Saints.

Now with his sixth album, the Mississippi-bred singer/guitarist merges his distinct sensibilities into a stripped-down, roots-oriented sound that starkly showcases the gritty elegance of his songwriting. The follow-up to 2014\u2019s critically praised Daylight/Dark\u2014an album that \u201cbelongs on a shelf next to Dwight Yoakam\u2019s Buenos Noches from a Lonely Room, Joe Ely\u2019s Letter to Laredo, and yes, even Willie Nelson\u2019s Phases and Stages,\u201d according to AllMusic\u2014Eady\u2019s latest finds the Fort Worth, Texas-based artist again teaming up with producer Kevin Welch. Now longtime collaborators (with their past efforts including 2012\u2019s AM Country Heaven, a top 40 debut on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart), Eady and Welch worked closely in crafting the album\u2019s acoustic-driven yet lushly textured aesthetic. \u201cAt the beginning I told everyone I wanted to make a record where, if the power went out, we could still sit down and play all the songs the exact same way,\u201d says Eady, who points out that steel guitar is the only electric instrument featured on the album. Despite its subtle approach, the album radiates a warm vitality that\u2019s got much to do with Eady\u2019s gift for nuanced yet unaffected slice-of-life storytelling. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to writing that\u2019s got a simplicity to it, where you\u2019re digging deep into real day-to-day life,\u201d he notes. Here, that means touching on such matters as turning 40 (on the reflective, soul-stirring \u201c40 Years\u201d), his daughter\u2019s growing up and going off to college (on the sweetly heartbreaking \u201cNot Too Loud\u201d), and the everyday struggle to \u201cembrace the messy parts of life instead of trying to get the point where you\u2019ve somehow fixed all your problems\u201d (on \u201cRain,\u201d a joyfully determined anthem featuring SteelDrivers fiddler Tammy Rogers). Throughout the album, Eady\u2019s soulfully rugged voice blends in beautiful harmonies with his wife, singer/songwriter Courtney Patton. And on \u201cNo Genie in This Bottle,\u201d the legendary Vince Gill lends his singular vocals to what Eady refers to as a \u201cgood old country drinking song.\u201d In each track, Eady reveals a sharp sense of songcraft he\u2019s honed since childhood. \u201cEven back in my early days of getting into music, I always cared more about the writers than the singers,\u201d says Eady, who grew up in Jackson. \u201cI\u2019d look up who\u2019d written a certain song, and then go seek out more songs from that writer.\u201d At age 14\u2014the same year he started writing his own material\u2014Eady began performing in local bars and showing his natural grasp of everything from soul and R&B to blues and country. After some time in the Air Force, he moved to Fort Worth and started playing open mic nights, where he quickly built up a devoted following. By 2005, Eady had made his debut with the independently released From Underneath The Old. For Eady\u2014who names Merle Haggard, Guy Clark, and Willie Nelson among his main inspirations\u2014instilling each song with so much graceful honesty proved to be his greatest achievement and thrill in creating the new album. \u201cWhen you first get started making music, your ideas are grandiose and more about the big picture. But the longer I\u2019ve done this, the more I\u2019ve realized that the real joy comes from the process rather than the end goal,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s about getting better and finding more of myself with every album. So instead of writing what I think people want to hear, I\u2019m writing what I want to write and trusting that\u2014as long as it\u2019s coming from an honest place\u2014it\u2019ll hopefully mean something to the people listening too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "210 Main St, Buda, TX 78610", "Artist": "Tyler Preston ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11446482.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.0792785, -97.84478659999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "The Cigar Vault", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Country recording artist Tyler Preston visits Buda to play a gritty acoustic 21+ show at The Cigar Vault on Saturday, July 24th at 7:30 PM \u2014 featuring unforgettable original songs about warm beer, cold women, hot sauce, and more.

Gabe Marshall and Bryon White met for a weekly gig that soon attracted all kinds of characters playing various instruments. These sessions quickly attracted a crowd, a semi-stable line-up was formed, and The Damn Quails were born. The band released their first record in 2011 entitled \u201cDown The Hatch\u201d. Since then, the band has firmly established itself as a touring entity hell bent on spreading their brand of music as far as possible. The Damn Quails carry on the great Oklahoma tradition of songwriting that draws from countless genres and has produced many memorable songs, bands, singers, and moments. They are proud to be part of such a rich musical heritage. They have taken their cue from their musical predecessors and forged their own and style that they loosely refer to Folk Rock. From the beginning Bryon and Gabe have had Thomas Young as their drummer. Not only does he keep the beat, but he also serves as a very stabilizing character that provides a very solid foundation on which the guys have built their musical monuments. Joining them playing a vast array of instruments is Kevin \u201cHaystack\u201d Foster. Kevin is a brilliant musician and singer who adds a dimension to the show that is undeniable. It seems like he has been there forever. On bass you have a close friend of Kevin\u2019s and a ball of positivity and energy known as Dillon Sampson. Dillon and Kevin attended South Plains College in Texas where they studied music. They are proud to bring their friendship and dedication to great playing to The Damn Quails. Upon its release \u201cDown the Hatch\u201d quickly became a favorite of both music critics and a growing legion of fans that is now refereed to as \u201cThe Covey\u201d. The record spawned the radio singles \u201cFool\u2019s Gold\u201d, \u201cSo So Long\u201d, and \u201cMe and the Whiskey\u201d. Just as the band was hitting its stride, they suddenly found themselves in a legal struggle with their management company and record label. The situation soon deteriorated in such a way that lawsuits were filed and the band found itself fighting to keep the rights to their own name, music, likeness, and everything associated with The Damn Quails. The band did the only thing it could do and continued to tour and spread the good word the only way they knew how, by playing live. Night after night the band made friends and fans across the country. For much of this time they had no CDs or t-shirts to sell to help keep themselves going. All they could do was play. This situation would have destroyed most bands, but The Quails chose to never give up. They had their music, themselves, and of course The Covey to help them along their way. After two years the lawsuit was finally settled. The band was given the ownership of the name The Damn Quails, and was finally allowed to record and release new music. Finding themselves without a label or any financial backing, the band turned to the people whose support had never wavered, The Covey. They started a Kickstarter Campaign in January of 2015 that raised almost $55,000 dollars to record their new record. They enlisted David Abeyta from Reckless Kelly to produce the record which they recorded in Austin, Texas at 12th Street Sound. They emerged with \u201cOut of the Birdcage\u201d which will be released on their own label Swomp Fyst Records on September 4th. The title signifies the freedom the band feels having finally emerged to follow their true path, a path where they own their own future and are in charge of their own destiny.

Tyler on September 22, 1970) is an American rapper who grew up in the 12th Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. He is one of many artists from Master P's New Orleans-based No Limit label to achieve both critical and commercial success. In 2003, Mystikal pled guilty to sexual battery. He is in currently serving a six-year prison sentence. Michael Tyler went to Cohen High School in New Orleans. Later he would go on to be in the Army and serve as a Meal, Ready-to-Eat supply clerk assigned to a stateside support unit. His debut album was Mystikal, released on the indie label Big Boy Records in 1995. He signed to Jive Records to release Mind of Mystikal in 1996. The album sold well, and he signed to Master P's No Limit Records for Unpredictable in 1997. The album sold well, and garnered him critical praise, though his real breakthrough was Let's Get Ready released in 2000, led by The Neptunes-produced hit \"Shake Ya Ass,\" and the only slightly-less-successful single \"Danger (Been So Long),\" which featured rising pop star Nivea. It debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, making it his only chart-topper to date. One of his most recent releases was the 2001 album Tarantula, which contained the single, \"Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against The Wall)\". Though it presented Mystikal's typical and unique flow style, the song also saw a blending of jazz and swing elements with hip-hop. He was also featured on \"Move Bitch\" by Ludacris. On January 16, 2004 Mystikal was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to forcing his hairstylist to perform sex acts. He also admitted to extortion. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex after they accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. Mystikal initinally denied the assault, but confessed after a videotape of the crime was found at his home. Bodyguards Leland \"Pokie\" Ellis and Vercy \"V\" Carter also pled guilty to sexual battery. [1]. Mystikal's 2006 parole hearing led to a denial of parole, specifically \"1002186 SEXUAL BATTERY OF INFIRM\" and \"702127 EXTORTION.\" He is currently incarcerated at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, which is just outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His D.O.C. number is 00469659. In August 2005, Mystikal was charged with two counts of failing to file tax returns for 1998 and 1999; if convicted, he could serve up to an additional year in prison for each count.", "otherInfo": "Doors open one (1) hour prior to showtime General Parking $15.00 Valet Parking $25.00"}, {"Address": "2100 Avenue of the Stars, Cedar Park, TX 78613", "Artist": "Mia X ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10043611.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.5412859, -97.8203092], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Hip Hop, Hip-hop, Hiphop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "H-E-B Center at Cedar Park", "moreBioInfo": "Born Mia from New Orleans La, Mia X started rapping with her crew New York Incorparated where she got the taste of eating Mc's both male and female alike, she dropped her first single the payback in 1992 and has hit the rap world like a comet since then, she recorded with No Limit Records and was known for being the first lady of the tank dropping classic albums like Unlady like ,Mammy Drama, and featuring on every artist at No Limit, doing duets with Mystikal, Master p, Silk the Shocker, C-Murder etc...

As for how the Texas quintet manages to slide so seamlessly between various styles and sounds? Well, these are no ordinary Gents. Rather, the members\u2014co-singers and frontmen Nik Lee  and Daniel Creamer (who also handle guitar and keys, respectively); guitarist Ryan Ake; bassist Scott Edgar Lee, Jr.; and drummer Aaron Haynes (who since the recording has been replaced by Paul Grass)\u2014have spent the last half-decade or so logging thousands of hours of stage and studio time behind a wide array of artists, from legends including Kris Kristofferson, George Strait and Joe Ely to young whippersnappers like Leon Bridges and Shakey Graves.   And while some people (okay, many people) have whispered in one another\u2019s ears and written kind words about how this crack outfit of stage and studio aces is nothing less than the second coming of celebrated backing units like the Wrecking Crew, the Swampers and one-time Bob Dylan associates the Band, you certainly didn\u2019t hear it from the Gents themselves. \u201cWe never instigated or condoned any of that,\u201d Nik Lee says, and then lets out a self-effacing laugh. \u201cWe definitely appreciate the comparisons\u2026we just don't think they\u2019re accurate.\u201d And anyway, no matter how many artists they\u2019ve played with onstage or in the studio\u2014and trust us, there\u2019s a whole lot of \u2018em\u2014they are, first and foremost, their own (gentle)men. \u201cWe\u2019re a group of five, and when you hear us play you\u2019re hearing the influence of five different musicians working together as one unit,\u201d Daniel Creamer says. \u201cEveryone has the freedom to suss out their parts and do the thing that fulfills their creative spirit, but at the same time there\u2019s trust in one another to always be serving the song.\u201d And what songs they are. Floor It!!! follows the Texas Gentlemen\u2019s 2018 debut, TX Jelly; but where that first record, cut in four days start to finish at Muscle Shoals\u2019 iconic FAME Studios, was very much a snapshot of a quick moment in time, the new effort is a decidedly more composed and crafted affair. \u201cThe vibe of the first one was, \u2018Let's just do this thing!\u2019 \u201d Creamer says. \u201cBut this time it was like, \u2018We have this idea about what we want to accomplish\u2026\u2019 \u201d What they did accomplish is, to put it mildly, pretty impressive. While the Gentlemen\u2019s sound is clearly steeped in the classic roots, rock and pop music of the \u201860s and \u201870s, there\u2019s a dreamy (the lilting \u201cSing Me to Sleep\u201d), spacey (\u201cSkyway Streetcar\u201d) and occasionally progressive (the groovy instrumental journey \u201cDark at the End of the Tunnel\u201d) element to what they do that seems to detach the music from belonging to any particular place and time.  Add in elements of funk, soul, country, r&b, southern rock, gospel (\u201cjust about all of us played in churches early on,\u201d Lee affirms) and essentially any other style that catches their musically omnivorous ears; an expansive and detailed approach to arrangement that sees the songs adorned with all manner of horns, strings and heavenly background vocals (cue up the positively gorgeous \u201cHard Road\u201d for an almost religious experience); and a healthy dose of wit (there\u2019s that song title, \u201cVeal Cutlass,\u201d again) and weirdness (the little lady on a jet, seated next to a military vet, who receives intel of impending nuclear doom on the Little Feat-meets-T. Rex-rocking title track), and you have a collection of tunes that is more than just a mere album. Rather, Floor It!!! is a rich and righteous ride. And while that ride took decidedly longer to complete than the four days spent on the Gent\u2019s first record\u2014they recorded Floor It!!! primarily at EchoLab Studios in Denton, Texas, with producer Matt Pence, who Lee describes in no uncertain terms as a \u201cwizard\u201d\u2014it was still a largely organic affair. \u201cWe all have pretty good grips on what we\u2019re supposed to do, so a lot of it was tracked live in the studio, with as few overdubs as possible,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe like to have it where everybody\u2019s just vibing together in one room.\u201d Adds Creamer, \u201cThe stuff you hear on the record is pretty fresh and spontaneous. It's not like we did a hundred takes of a song. We tend to just get a melody and follow it in a way that makes sense to us.\u201d That intuitive connection is hardly surprising given the fact that the bonds between the band members stretch back, in some cases, to the days before they were even Gentlemen. \u201cFor years even before we started the band, Daniel and I and a couple of the other guys all lived together in a big Brady Bunch house in Duncanville, just outside of Dallas,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe\u2019d just sit around and fiddle with stuff and it always worked really well. It was never forced.\u201d  Regarding the songwriting partnership between he and Creamer, Lee continues, \u201cThere\u2019s never any hiccups in the process. I think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had a lot of the same experiences\u2014we\u2019ve worked together on different sessions over the years and we know a lot of the same people, so we\u2019re pretty fluent in our ideas and opinions.\u201d He laughs. \u201cLike, if we wanted to take a jab at somebody in a song without letting on, we could do it pretty easily\u2014\u2018cause we\u2019d both know right away who it is.\u201d \u201cWe both just like to nerd out a little bit with melodies and arrangements,\u201d says Creamer. \u201cWe try to find something that tickles the ear a little bit and goes the extra mile, you know?\u201d So when it all comes down to it, what, exactly, is the Texas Gentlemen? \u201cIf somebody were to ask me that, I would say first and foremost that we\u2019re a group of friends,\u201d Creamer continues. \u201cAnd because of that, there\u2019s no limits on the music we create together. We like to have fun and do funky stuff and we like to rock and we like to jam. Sometimes that takes us into country music, sometimes it takes us into soul, sometimes into some progressive things. It can be all kinds of places. There\u2019s no constraints on what we do.\u201d As for how Lee would describe the Gents? \u201cI think it was said best by a guy on BBC radio,\u201d  he responds. \u201cWe were on tour in Europe, and we\u2019re driving to the airport and the DJ comes on and he clears his throat and he goes, \u2018Okay, up next we have a Texas boo-gie band called the Texas Gentlemen.\u2019 So that\u2019s what I like to say: we're a Texas boogie band! \u201cBut really,\u201d Lee continues, \u201cthis band is less about a style and more just a way of life. The music that we\u2019re playing can change at any given moment\u2014we just kind of go with the flow. When it comes down to it, we just want to have a good ol\u2018 time.\u201d And so, dear listener, should you. And in that department the Texas Gentlemen have got you covered. Just grab a hot-off-the-presses copy of their latest record, slap it on your nearest hi-fi, drop the needle on the grooves and Floor It!!! This Lone Star-bred collective takes its cues from some of the iconic acts of the past \u2014 the quicksilver brilliance of The Wrecking Crew, The Muscle Shoals Swampers (who backed everyone from Aretha to Wilson Pickett), Booker T. and The M.G.\u2019s, and Bob Dylan\u2019s one-time backers The Band are the most obvious examples. In 2014, the band took up a residency in Dallas, Texas at Sundown at Granada, during which The Texas Gentlemen assumed their name. Soon after, the Gents began collaborating with a multitude of artists on stage and in the studio, becoming an all-purpose backing band for an eclectic array of singer-songwriters, including Leon Bridges, Nikki Lane, and more. In 2016, the Gentlemen were lured out of the studio to the Newport Folk Festival, where they were joined by iconic troubadour Kris Kristofferson, making his first Newport appearance in more than 45 years. Rolling Stone called it one of the festival\u2019s \u201cmost exciting sets.\u201d Kristofferson so enjoyed collaborating with The Texas Gentlemen that he enlisted them to reprise their roles in a series of critically acclaimed Texas concerts. Of Kristofferson and The Texas Gentlemen\u2019s appearance at Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, music critic Preston Jones wrote \u201cThe [instruments] would slowly coalesce around Kristofferson\u2019s gnarled but still potent voice, creating an electric sensation of the past fusing with the present.\u201d That deft fusion of before and right now is possible thanks to the musicians\u2019 unswerving dedication to simply playing to the best of their abilities, trusting their instincts, and letting the music guide them.

She is not afraid to step out of the box from song to song while still following her vision of song oriented rock layered in a luscious soundscape of melodic instrumentation and vocals. There is a message, emotion, and uniqueness within each song that transcends trends while still embracing the familiar.\u201d - John Moyer (Disturbed) New York, NY: Austin-based, hard/alternative artist, Hanna Barakat, announces her new  album, Siren, showcasing \u201ca vocally powerful performance by the Texas-native driven by compelling songwriting and thunderous production.\" (Substream Magazine) Born in Texas to a Lebanese father and American mother,  Barakat combines a variety of influences. \"While proudly paying homage to her roots, Barakat has cultivated her own style that merges Arab-Oriental influences with her love of rock music for a stunningly unique and original sound.\" (Metal Nexus). Pure Grain Audio declares, \"Artists come and go like skin cells but, sometimes, there are those that truly stand out for their immense talents. Barakat is clearly a member of the latter.\u201d   The album was produced by John Moyer, bassist from famed hard rock band, Disturbed, and mixed by Martin Nessi (Michael Jackson estate, Ariana Grande, Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Ricky Martin, Kelly Clarkson), and mastered by Ted Jensen of Sterling Sound (Disturbed, Evanescence, Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, Halestorm, Pat Metheny).   Barakat beautifully describes the inspiration behind the album:   \u201cI chose the title, Siren, for my debut record, after John Moyer and I produced our final song together, which happened to be \u201cSiren.\u201d The power of the music and the lyrics filled me with such fire. It motivated me and inspired me to take this next step in my journey with such confidence. Though the song references the mythical sirens of the sea, I loved the idea of a double meaning: an actual siren, warning call, alarm! The songs on this record were written over a span of 10 years. These songs have been my comfort and my therapy, as I\u2019ve journeyed this world, witnessed injustices, engrossed myself in my ancestral culture, grown within myself, literally travelled the globe, loved, lost, failed, loved again, and struggled to reach the place where I am today. I want to bring awareness to these situations, not by forcing any political agenda, but by pushing for love, understanding, and acceptance of all the other humans walking this earth together. Throughout history, there have been unnatural walls physically erected, or socially accepted and perpetuated, in order to divide people. I want to tear those walls down. All of them. Through my music, with rock guitars, heavy drums, deep rhythmic bass lines, and my intricate vocal melodic lines and punchy harmony stacks, I have chosen to forge Arab instruments like the oud, kanun, frame drum, riqq, into my sonic landscape, where I feel they so naturally and appropriately belong.\u201d For All Media Inquiries: Meijin Bruttomesso, Effective Immediately PR (212) 777-6727x209 / meijin@ei-pr.com", "otherInfo": "SHADOW MINISTRY\nHANNA BARAKAT\nMore bands TBA..."}, {"Address": "2906 Fruth St, Austin, TX 78705", "Artist": "Screamin' J ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11404139.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2953157, -97.74205219999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk, Noise, Doom Metal", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Screamin\u2019 J", "moreBioInfo": "Doom Folk experimental band", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "381 Mercer St, Dripping Springs, TX 78620", "Artist": "Brandon Alan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9026316.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.1925402, -98.09052059999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Hudson's On Mercer", "moreBioInfo": "www.facebook.com/brandonalanmusic Twitter: @TheBrandonAlan Www.brandonalanmusic.net", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1190 Gruene Rd, New Braunfels, TX 78130", "Artist": "Sun Valley Station ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11474140.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.7347344, -98.1028407], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Country, Rock, Americana, Alternative", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Villa At Gruene", "moreBioInfo": "Sun Valley Station is a five-piece Americana Rock & Roll band, based in Austin, TX.

Since the 1970s. this country music icon has shared his love of everything Texas in dance halls and concert stages around the world, to the point that he was named Ambassador of Texas Music by the governor. For more than 40 years, Gary P. Nunn has sung the praises of our state, and his latest album \"Taking Texas To The Country\" paints a picture of Texas that proves that Nunn is a master craftsman. Positive responses are no accident. Nunn, a founding father of the progressive country movement, is also a forward thinker when it comes to choosing songs to record. His secret? The folks who scoot their boots across the dance floor each night. Called a pioneer by his peers, Nunn ha never been afraid of blazing new music paths, a fact noticed and admired by Red Dirt and Texas musicians.\"I think they've learned from me that they can do it themselves\" said Nunn. \" I was one of the first people to make an independetly-produced record. I started a publishing company and a production company along with a independent label. Being able to cut trugh a major mountain of red tape is now an opportunity for Nunn to get his songs to audiences quickly. Who would have ever anticipated the way our business is now, and how it's changed so much through the years, Nunn said. Today we have a new standard. The great thing about iTunes is that we don't have to have the approval of the major record labels to get radio play or even to make record sales. We can go directly to our audience. Nunn's fans understand, his music is a good fit, and they put it to good use. \"Once I had a couple coming to me and say that when their son graduated high school and was living home the first time, they sat him down and played \"Under My Hat\". It's a song sort of like a father giving his son some good advice. They told him, were gonna leave you with this before you go out into the world\". \"One of the things that really touches my heart, is to think that folks can use some of these songs to pass on to their children as good positive advice - something they can take with them for there entire life. \"That makes me real proud\"", "otherInfo": "Gary P.

With a long catalog and longer list of peers with whom she has written, recorded and toured, McNally continues to turn out great music that defies blatant genre-fication. At home across the American (Americana) music spectrum, the Grammy nominee who\u2019s live music career began on the jam band circuit of the 1990\u2019s with bands like Robert Randolph and Derek Trucks, writes as well as she interprets the songs of others, has a top tier musicality to her craft, a soul stirring voice that immediately grabs one by the heart strings and a troubadour\u2019s wanderlust, not to mention as it turns out, she is also an excellent electric guitar player.

Her quiet but steady plodding through the many layers of the business of music, hasn\u2019t ever been rewarded with massive fame and fortune but in time that slow burn has become the treasure in and of itself. The part of McNally\u2019s narrative that is often missed is that not only has she self-managed herself for nearly all of her career but that she has also been a stout warrior-like-artist who often went toe-to-toe with label heads and A&R to defend and fight for her visions. She left the major label world after ten years at Capital/EMI to fend for herself on various smaller labels and self-release paradigms.

As the record kicks in, haunting, echoey guitars set a tone of where the listener is going to go. \u201cAsphalt & Concrete,\u201d the first song on the record, paints a picture of a desert girl cutting loose and losing a bit of herself in the big city. Bri soars vocally as she sings, \u201cWell I\u2019m into sunsets and I love the sand, but I wasn\u2019t myself in a disrupted land, with buildings and people and too many drinks in my hand.\u201d Bri is constantly flirting with the lyric as she tussles, barefoot on the streets of Austin. \u201cIf you were a Cowboy\u201d follows and is the slated as the first single releasing to radio and streaming outlets. A hard driving, sexy, mid-tempo tune with just enough attitude, it gives listeners a resume of what it takes to capture a confident, hard-working woman\u2019s heart. Bri explains, \u201cThis is the only song on the record I didn\u2019t write. It wasn\u2019t my intention to cut outside of my craft, but my producer Rachel Loy played me the song, and I instantly looked at her with \u2018I-have-to-have-this\u2019 eyes.\u201d As this female anthem drives, \u201cif you had real dust on your boots, the kind that\u2019s passed down from your roots, I bet i would fall for you, if you were a cowboy,\u201d every woman feels the need for a strong, hard-working man, but she also has no time for anything inauthentic. \u201cI am so proud of the record we have created, no matter how cliche that sounds. I have put everything I have, and every dollar to my name creating this record for myself and my fans. I truly believe it is the best record I have ever released, and the pressure I felt to create something great pushed me to the max. I embraced it. I can\u2019t wait for everyone to hear it.\u201d With songs like \u201cCheat on Me,\u201d (a co write with Courtney Patton), \u201cGraffiti,\u201d \u201cRing a Bell\u201d (co write with Jody Booth), and \u201cI Can\u2019t Be Lonely,\u201d each song takes on a autobiographical life of its own, but comes together in a cohesive image of the woman that sings them. \u201cRachel and I spent countless hours, concentrating and obsessing over every lyric, every melody\u2026 we tore apart and reconstructed anything necessary to make sure everything was exactly what the song truly needed. I think you can feel the work we put in when you listen to it.\u201d The CD\u2019s last song, \u201cEmpty Chairs,\u201d will strike a chord with her friends, peers, and mentors as a songwriter\u2019s lament. Bri sheds light on the constant struggle that every touring musician battles: the rollercoaster of how live show attendance, record sales, and ticket counts are the benchmark of how performers are judged in this business, and the toll the size of the audience can take on their heart each night. It\u2019s a song that lets the listener see inside of Bri\u2019s dream, and how important each set of ears is to her. Naturally, doubt can enter one\u2019s mind in any given situation; Bri shares how faith in her dream can at times be a struggle, despite her gratitude and obvious trust in the path God has chosen for her. She beautifully sings, \u201cI\u2019m grateful, but if they only knew, what\u2019s behind three chords and the truth. They only get to see me at my best, but I\u2019ve been cursed and I\u2019ve been blessed, by the answer to my prayers. It\u2019s hard to beat the thrill of a high, when I play a sold out night and feel like God has put me there. But Lord are you still with me, when i see Empty Chairs\u201d.

From there both stories, of nation and artist, sweep westward, drawing from new surroundings, absorbing what each station on their way has to offer. America\u2019s journey is still underway. But in a sense Chuck Shaw has found what he was looking for: a place where he can put down roots and nurture his unique artistry. For Shaw, that place is, as someone once crooned, deep in the heart of Texas. He\u2019s been there for just a few years but that\u2019s time enough for him to know he has come home. With his love for old-school country music, his ability to write songs nourished by that tradition and sing them with rare expression, this is where he has always belonged. \u201cEven when I was in high school back in New Jersey, I knew I was probably going to end up in Texas,\u201d he reflects. \u201cAnd later, when I was in Colorado and Wyoming, friends kept telling me, \u2018You need to move to Texas. You sound like you belong there. That\u2019s where the real stuff is.\u2019\u201d The \u201creal stuff\u201d is country music that\u2019s about substance, not style. All you need to do is listen to his self-titled debut album to know it\u2019s true. It\u2019s in the raunch, grit and swagger of \u201cDirty Woman Creek,\u201d the neon glow and greasy groove of \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time,\u201d the morning-after cobwebs and cold daylight that color \u201cHope I Can Get Through Today\u201d We could go through all 12 tracks, up to the handclaps and gospel affirmation of \u201cRise Up,\u201d each one written by Shaw except for his striking rendition of \u201cLong Black Veil\u201d and little-known gem \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time.\u201d Like so many good things in life, it goes by fast and easy and then lingers until it\u2019s cued up again. This is Lone Star country \u2014 but the deeper you listen, the more hints you hear of the path he took to reach that destination. In his first single, \u201cBurn That Oil,\u201d the harmonica riff and nostalgic reminiscence might bring Springsteen to mind. Shaw wouldn\u2019t deny it, being born and raised through high school in New Jersey. But even in his formative years, with his friends immersed mainly in rap, Shaw felt the call of country, first from groups like The Eagles and Creedence Clearwater Revival. \u201cA lot of the rock I grew up with had country roots,\u201d he says. \u201cThen one day in high school, after I\u2019d gotten my heart broken, I bought the John Fogerty album Blue Ridge Rangers, where he covered a bunch of country songs including \u2018She Thinks I Still Care.\u2019 That song really spoke to me. And through the album as a whole I discovered George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and all the others who would influence me so much.\u201d After getting his first electric guitar at age 13, Shaw formed a band \u2014 probably the only one in his part of the Garden State that featured a country fiddle player. He started writing songs too. The more he crafted his style, the more determined he was to seek inspiration out west, the cradle of the music he had come to love. So after graduation, he headed out to the Rocky Mountains to study creative writing at Colorado College. Equally important, he honed his vocal and instrumental chops with the school\u2019s celebrated Bluegrass Ensemble, an education that included three appearances at the Durango Bluegrass Meltdown. Eventually, after working for a couple of summers on a ranch in Wyoming and then spending a year in Arizona that included four months on the road with the country/rock band Mostly Water, Shaw made his pilgrimage to Nashville. With money he\u2019d saved from Mostly Water, he recorded an EP and, in the summer of 2015, started playing in Music City\u2019s fabled honky-tonks. Nights of grinding out country hits in touristy dives sharpened his performance skills. It also cued him when it was time to get out of town. \u201cIt was exciting at first,\u201d Shaw remembers. \u201cIt taught me how to interact with the crowd, how to get people excited. And there were some great singers and players down there. But I started hating it after a while because I just couldn\u2019t stand to play mainstream pop/country day and night, over and over again. Even songs that I loved got beaten to death. There was so little originality.\u201d And so Shaw embarked on the last stage of his Odyssey, this time to San Marcos late in 2016. Since then, he went from finding a place to live in a town filled with strangers to building up friends and followers through open-mike nights and paying gigs throughout Central Texas. \u201cI fought hard to play anywhere I could,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if meant annoying the heck out of club owners, I did what I had to do to get my name out there.\u201d Persistence has paid off and put this young man square in the spotlight as one of traditional country\u2019s most promising new talents. Chuck Shaw makes that more than clear \u2014 and for those who somehow still don\u2019t get the message, he\u2019s happy to lay it all out in plain Texan: \u201cThe music I love is real,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s pure. It\u2019s a great American art form. I love how it sounds \u2014 the fiddle, the pedal steel \u2014 and how it feels. They know that down where I live, but when I play somewhere else, where people only know that mainstream pop country, I explain to them: This is how we do it in Texas. \u201cThis is country music.\u201d -30-", "otherInfo": "Full band!"}, {"Address": "1509 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "Del Castillo ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8170104.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.25193, -97.76378389999999], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "International, Latin Rock, World, Nuevo Americano, Latin, Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "One 2 One Bar", "moreBioInfo": "Del Castillo is a cross-cultural power in music.

Film Director Robert Rodriguez attended a Del Castillo concert in 2002 and a great friendship developed between the two. Rodriguez then enlisted the group to contribute music to the soundtracks of his movies, such as \u201cSpy Kids 3D\u201d, \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Mexico\u201d,\u201cSin City\u201d, and \u201cGRINDHOUSE\u201d, and perform with him at the premieres. Rodriguez was so impressed with Del Castillo that he wanted to record with them, so together, they formed CHINGON and recorded an amazing electric rendition of the Mexican classic song, \u201cMalaguena Salerosa\u201d. Quentin Tarantino loved it so much that he re-did the ending sequence of \u201cKill Bill Vol. II\u201d to fit the song into his movie. By 2004, Del Castillo was touring nationwide across the country playing with such diverse acts as Styx, Los Lonely Boys, Ozomatli, Don Henley, Los Lobos, and Willie Nelson and continued tour non-stop through 2006. They have performed at three of Willie Nelson\u2019s 4th Of July Picnics, and at Eric Clapton\u2019s Crossroads Guitar Festival, and they have made numerous national and local TV appearances. Willie Nelson enjoyed Del Castillo so much that he re-recorded his song \u201cI Never Cared For You\u201d with the group (which is included on Del Castillo\u2019s Brotherhood CD) and calls it \u201chis favorite version\u201d. Nelson has become a good friend of the band as well and the two look forward to touring together again soon. During 2008, the band began playing major festivals all over the country and even Canada and widening its audience at a much more rapid rate. At California\u2019s famous Strawberry Music Festival, they were deemed the highlight of the festival and broke the merchandise sales record. Immediately after their incendiary debut performance at the Vancouver Folk Festival in Canada, they were selected to play the headlining stage for 2009. Rick and Mark del Castillo were selected in December 2008, by Gibson Global, to be two of only about SIX guitarists in the world to launch their new state-of the-art Dark Fire Gibson Les Paul guitar line. The band, now reunited with longtime charismatic frontman Alex Ruiz providing lead vocals, is recording new music with the brothers\u2019 mesmerizing guitar driven songs, intertwined with hypnotic rhythms from Mike Zeoli and Jason Murdy, and pulsating bass lines from Albert Besteiro. Through their great artistic friendship and partnership with director Robert Rodriguez, Rick, Mark, Alex & Mike are featured actors performing on the TV show \"From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series\" on the El Rey Network! \u201cI want to bring the most exciting and authentic content possible,\u201d said Rodriguez when announcing the TV series. \u201cChingon and Del Castillo have been part of my experience providing this kind of entertainment to audiences since the beginning.\u201d Del Castillo\u2019s new instrumental track, \u201cLas Seis Cuerdas de Tony Montuno\u201d was recently hand picked to be featured on episode 2 of ABC\u2019s new crime/drama Killer Women (01/14).

The San Antonio-based group packed the small bars and local hangouts and quickly became the Alamo City\u2019s most-loved band, earning them a spot on the cover of Billboard Magazine in 1996. It was the beginning of a twenty year journey for Geil and the 4-piece ensemble. Releasing \u201cTwo Tons Of Steel\u201d in 1994 and \u201cCrazy For My Baby\u201d in 1995 on Blue Fire Records, a sponsorship deal with Lone Star Beer quickly followed. Dead Crickets, renamed Two Tons of Steel in 1996 began traveling outside of Texas, including stops at the Grand Ole\u2019 Opry in Nashville, Tenn., the National Theater in Havana, Cuba, and European tours, to greet fans who had embraced their Texas-born sound. In 1996 they released \u201cOh No!\u201d on their independent label, \u201cBig Bellied Records.\u201d They followed up the passion project with a live recording at the legendary Gruene Hall in Gruene, Texas, taped during a Two Ton Tuesday Show 1998. In 2017, the band marks 22 years of legendary \u201cTwo Ton Tuesday Live from Gruene Hall.\u201d The summer-long event has drawn over 200,00 fans to the iconic show.

His sound breaks aways from the various subgenres of EDM but holds onto origins of dubstep and hip-hop, creating a truly authentic experience for his audience. Early on in his career Minnesota said, \u201cMy goal is to make bass heavy dubstep/glitch-hop music that\u2019ll get you dancing, but it is not the same old three note transformer step\u2026 I try to focus more on the melodic side of dubstep, and hopefully, make quality songwriting a more relevant factor in the genre.\u201d For the past four years Minnesota has followed through on his word and designed smooth, melodic, uplifting sounds, which fans have celebrated nationwide. Originally from Minneapolis, MN, Christian Bauhofer moved to Santa Cruz, CA when he was 18 years old. Fresh out of the Midwest, his newfound California friends gave him the nickname \u2018Minnesota,\u2019 and unknowingly created his soon-to-be party crushing alter ego. He learned the guitar at age 12 and made numerous attempts to form a band, but it wasn\u2019t until he attended Symbiosis Gathering for the first time in 2009 that his career in music became clear. The festival drew him into the emerging EDM culture with performances by Bassnectar, Pretty Lights and the Glitch Mob. Shortly after Symbiosis, Minnesota purchased Ableton Live and his first midi controller, and within a few months was making hip-hop remixes that his friends couldn\u2019t stop playing. Around the same time, Minnesota teamed up with a couple friends and started a production company called Vital SC (now Vital Events). The company had a successful start, hosting a string shows around the Bay Area with big name artists. But Minnesota eventually split off from the promoting side of the industry in pursuit of his musical career\u2014and today he couldn\u2019t be happier with his decision. Minnesota\u2019s first EP, Panda Snatching Tycoon, came out on Tycho Records in January 2011. It received critical acclaim from a national audience, prompting Minnesota to drop his second official album, Ancient Machines EP, just months after. Released on Mal Label, Ancient Machines hit number nine on the Addictech.com best seller\u2019s list for 2011 and every track appeared on the Beatport.com glitch-hop charts. During this time, Minnesota also managed to put out a free EP with MartyParty called Ultraviolet Halo that was released in July 2011. His fourth EP, Astral Projection, came out the following year and showcased his affinity for downtempo melodic ethereal sounds, which diversified his fan-base through hits like \u201cStardust,\u201d and \u201cRelax.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s fifth album, Altered States EP, has since been his most popular with tracks being played by DJs across the country. He describes the album as, \u201cbig room, melodic bangers,\u201d with some, \u201cfaster tempo hip hop influenced stuff on it.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s most recent release Voyager EP resonates as a culmination of these projects, balancing his identifiable melodic synths with the bounce of 808\u2019s. The album, fine-tuned with experience and precision, plays naturally in the evolution of Minnesota\u2019s signature sound. Now in his fourth year of touring, Minnesota has traveled to over 50 cities and performed at nearly every major festival nationwide. Last year he headlined his first two tours, and performed with the likes of STS9, Big Gigantic, MiMOSA and Gramatik. His music has been lauded by the likes of Bassnectar, Adventure Club, Paper Diamond and many others in his genre. Discussing Minnesota\u2019s track \u201cPush It,\u201d Bassnectar once commented, \u201c[It\u2019s] quickly becoming a staple in my sets,\u201d and \u201cperfect for when I need a track that is epic and churning but also melodically hyped.\u201d The support of Minnesota\u2019s management team, agency, and some of the world\u2019s greatest artists can only attribute to his hunger for more time spent on the road and in the studio. To those that haven\u2019t had the opportunity to see Minnesota perform, make sure to be on the lookout for the next time he rolls into your city.

In his acclaimed 25 year musical career, he has lit up stages nationally and internationally, and spent nearly a decade performing on Broadway in New York City. Now, with the release of his self-titled debut EP, Kenny Williams Sings, Kenny steps into his favorite role to date. The Austin, Texas based artist is a tornado of talent and charisma, possessing an impressive vocal range and a light-from-within aura. At his core, Kenny is a pop artist with a refined palette, carefully choosing his repertoire based purely on emotional resonance; if a song hits his heart, he performs it. His experience as an acclaimed Broadway performer and as solo singer merge on Kenny Williams Sings. In this elegant guitar and vocal duo setting, Kenny proves to be a storyteller in song using delicate vocal phrasing to convey emotionality. Kenny Williams Sings boasts 6 classics from the American Songbook, and a stunning version of Van Morrison\u2019s slinky \u201cMoondance.\u201d The EP opens with a buttery version of the Mann/Evans chestnut \u201cNo Moon At All.\u201d Here, Kenny navigates the melody with sweet swagger above a groovy and sultry guitar accompaniment. He is faithful to the melody, but makes it his own with his tender soulful vibrato and lovely languid flow. His quiet-fire version of \u201cFly Me To The Moon\u201d is a stunner, and a live show fan favorite. His imaginative reading brings forth a haunting beauty often lost in the tune\u2019s typically brisk presentation. \u201cI am a balladeer at heart. I love songs that express yearning and deep emotion,\u201d Kenny affirms. Another EP standout is his smoky rendition of \u201cFor All We Know\u201d which showcases his delicate power with dynamics to convey subtle emotions. Throughout this program of songs, jazz guitarist Art Carvajal accompanies Kenny with sensitive dexterity. The resulting EP is one that harnesses universal sentiments of love and longing from a selection of songs indelibly etched in the world's music consciousness. Kenny\u2019s fifteen years of living and performing in New York City included his Broadway debut in Disney\u2019s hit musical The Lion King, as well as roles in the world premiere production of The Color Purple: The Musical, produced by Oprah Winfrey; and starring performances in the national tours of the musicals Grease! and Smokey Joe\u2019s Caf\u00e9.

Now living in Austin, Texas, where he was born and raised, Kenny can also be seen performing at Zach Theatre, where he began his meteoric theatrical career. Here, Kenny has appeared in the critically acclaimed \"Sophisticated Ladies\" (Raconteur), where he starred opposite Tony Award winner Jennifer Holiday. He also appeared in Bob Telson\u2019s \"Gospel at Colonus\" (The Friend), and in a rockin' new adaptation of \"A Christmas Carol\", where he originated the role of the unforgettable and lovable Ghost of Christmas Past. Although theatre is still a prominent part of his life, Kenny\u2019s primary focus is on his individual vocal expression and sharing music that is emotionally moving and heartfelt. When not on the theatrical stage, you can find him performing at various music venues around Austin. Put simply, Kenny Williams was born to entertain, and his star shines brightly.

But it was Pat Green's recordings of several songs that made Wilkins' name known in Texas. \"God Bless Pat,\" Waltsays. \"I never want to take Pat's influence on my life for granted. He was a very early champion of my writing, and I have generally like his versions of my songs more than my own. And I know I have him to thank for getting somefolks out to hear me play, and buying my records. I remain a fan of Pat's songs, voice, and personality. And his killer band - their recording of 'Ruby's Two Sad Daughters' is really beautiful.\" Wilkins' work has been likened to the greatest and most timeless of the Texas/American troubadours: Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, and Kevin Welch among others. But it's the John Steinbeck comparison that means the most. \"It was in a review of 'Fire, Honey & Angels,' in Country Standard Time. That's a remark to keep close.\" Wilkins says. \"I have written poetry since I was in grade school, and songs for over twenty years now. It means an awful lot to be mentioned in the same sentence as someone with as much gravity as Steinbeck.. I do try to take my given work in the world seriously, and try not to shy away from the heavy subjects in life: commitment, faith, death.\" \"Diamonds in the Sun\", produced by Lloyd Maines, is Walt's latest project scheduled to be released on July 24th by Palo Duro Records.", "otherInfo": "Sunday afternoon 1-4pm FREE Show"}, {"Address": "1300 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78702", "Artist": "Forrest Weiss ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11117489.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2641192, -97.72925819999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Red Dirt Country, Country, Bluegrass, Texas Blues, Texas Country Music, Indie, Acoustic, Country Blues, Texas Country, Acoustic Blues", "Time": "1:30 PM", "Venue": "Forrest Weiss LIVE @ The Lucky Duck", "moreBioInfo": "Practice\u2026 That\u2019s all it has been my whole life.

Her influences span generations of blues, country, and rock 'n' roll greats that led her to a unique soulful, country-tinged brand of roots rock 'n' roll. With her 2013 release One More Time Again - and debut as Beth Lee & The Breakups - she began honing in and developing her energetic live performances. Her soulful, heart-on-your-sleeve songwriting style evolved to include a sultry, sassy, rock 'n' roll edge. Her last LP, Keep Your Mouth Shut, released in May 2016, garnered positive reviews from independent radio and roots publications, including a #19 rank on the Americana Music Show's year end list and a flattering review from KUTX's Laurie Gallardo, who coined the sound as \"country-fried rock 'n' soul\". It was also listed in Alternate Root Magazine and Third Coast Music Magazine as one of the year's top picks. Beth is releasing a new album February 12th, Waiting on You Tonight.

In his first single, \u201cBurn That Oil,\u201d the harmonica riff and nostalgic reminiscence might bring Springsteen to mind. Shaw wouldn\u2019t deny it, being born and raised through high school in New Jersey. But even in his formative years, with his friends immersed mainly in rap, Shaw felt the call of country, first from groups like The Eagles and Creedence Clearwater Revival. \u201cA lot of the rock I grew up with had country roots,\u201d he says. \u201cThen one day in high school, after I\u2019d gotten my heart broken, I bought the John Fogerty album Blue Ridge Rangers, where he covered a bunch of country songs including \u2018She Thinks I Still Care.\u2019 That song really spoke to me. And through the album as a whole I discovered George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and all the others who would influence me so much.\u201d After getting his first electric guitar at age 13, Shaw formed a band \u2014 probably the only one in his part of the Garden State that featured a country fiddle player. He started writing songs too. The more he crafted his style, the more determined he was to seek inspiration out west, the cradle of the music he had come to love. So after graduation, he headed out to the Rocky Mountains to study creative writing at Colorado College. Equally important, he honed his vocal and instrumental chops with the school\u2019s celebrated Bluegrass Ensemble, an education that included three appearances at the Durango Bluegrass Meltdown. Eventually, after working for a couple of summers on a ranch in Wyoming and then spending a year in Arizona that included four months on the road with the country/rock band Mostly Water, Shaw made his pilgrimage to Nashville. With money he\u2019d saved from Mostly Water, he recorded an EP and, in the summer of 2015, started playing in Music City\u2019s fabled honky-tonks. Nights of grinding out country hits in touristy dives sharpened his performance skills. It also cued him when it was time to get out of town. \u201cIt was exciting at first,\u201d Shaw remembers. \u201cIt taught me how to interact with the crowd, how to get people excited. And there were some great singers and players down there. But I started hating it after a while because I just couldn\u2019t stand to play mainstream pop/country day and night, over and over again. Even songs that I loved got beaten to death. There was so little originality.\u201d And so Shaw embarked on the last stage of his Odyssey, this time to San Marcos late in 2016. Since then, he went from finding a place to live in a town filled with strangers to building up friends and followers through open-mike nights and paying gigs throughout Central Texas. \u201cI fought hard to play anywhere I could,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if meant annoying the heck out of club owners, I did what I had to do to get my name out there.\u201d Persistence has paid off and put this young man square in the spotlight as one of traditional country\u2019s most promising new talents. Chuck Shaw makes that more than clear \u2014 and for those who somehow still don\u2019t get the message, he\u2019s happy to lay it all out in plain Texan: \u201cThe music I love is real,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s pure. It\u2019s a great American art form. I love how it sounds \u2014 the fiddle, the pedal steel \u2014 and how it feels. They know that down where I live, but when I play somewhere else, where people only know that mainstream pop country, I explain to them: This is how we do it in Texas. \u201cThis is country music.\u201d -30-", "otherInfo": "Acoustic"}, {"Address": "10106 Manchaca Rd, Austin, TX 78748", "Artist": "Cracker Box Gospel Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.1703304, -97.8261086], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Armadillo Den", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4812 Mt Bonnell Rd, Austin, TX 78731", "Artist": "Ellie Turner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11537555.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.3331386, -97.77649919999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie Folk, Americana, Acoustic, Folk", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Ellie Turner & Jack Schneider on The Mostly Texas Tour (and some other places too...)", "moreBioInfo": "\"I saw Ellie Turner sing live and somehow her voice was demanding without ever thickening past egg shell.

And with good reason. The group\u2019s blend of Americana, country and blues quickly made them favorites, opening for the likes of Lukas Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver, and comedian Ron White. They have earned plaudits for their uptempo, high-energy live show, and they\u2019re also two-time recipients of a Black Fret Grant, which is given to rising bands in Austin, Texas. Yet, two albums into their career, the band wanted a change \u2014 after realizing that a slightly unexpected, non-musical element was holding them back. At the time, the band was called Texas K.G.B. No, they weren\u2019t a part of some Texan secret society or supporters of the Russian secret police. Instead, the group\u2019s moniker came from Green herself \u2014 Kelly Green Band. When they first formed, Green was the lead member and face of the band. However, that didn\u2019t stop wary bookers abroad from staying away from the band- despite their musical merits- due to perceived provocativeness of their name. When Lea joined in 2017, the band now had three strong singers and songwriters to front the stage. It no longer felt right to have a name focus on a single person. After they completed their latest album, band producer Gordy Quist of Band of Heathens suggested that they consider changing their name. As the times have become far more political in the three years since the band got going, the time was right for them to leave Texas K.G.B. in the past. Following multiple brainstorming sessions over the course of a few months, a name finally clicked. There were plenty of strong contenders, ultimately though, Madam Radar was the winner. Madam Radar\u2019s upcoming self-titled album is slated to be independently released in early 2020, and it\u2019s clear that their name change has energized them. It\u2019s easy to hear contributions across the board in every single song on the record, with various singers throughout. The collaborative process strengthened what were already tight songs and allowed them to flourish. Songs like \u201cFriend of a Friend\u201d and \u201cYoung Wild Love\u201d exemplify how fruitful the fluidity of this process were. Each song, albeit about two completely different subjects (the former is the importance of a support system and the latter about the trials that relationships bring), had different songwriters, yet at its core, stays true to the band\u2019s sound. The chill environment allowed Madam Radar to be at their collective best. With plans for a big 2020, in addition to the album\u2019s release, a tour is looming as well, the band is excited about the prospects of what\u2019s to come. Despite accomplishing as much as they did as Texas K.G.B., Madam Radar aren\u2019t looking back. With a new album ready to go, Madam Radar is excited to begin the next chapter of their burgeoning career. Be on the lookout for their new single, \u201cCarolina,\u201d to be released early 2020.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "418 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Docman ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.267162, -97.73846499999999], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Vulcan Gas Company", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Docman is performing live at Vulcan Gas Company on July 25th, 2021, so get your tickets now.

His mother and father were stationed there at the time. In 1995, Robinson\u2019s parents split, and his mother moved to New York. They moved into an apartment with his two cousins, Lenard Gibson (LG) and Nathanial Robinson. LG, his older cousin, was into the drug dealing epidemic of the 90s. Docman was heavenly influenced by the things that were happening around him. Typical life in Queensbridge in the late 90s was rough. His mother was struggling to make ends meet as she worked two jobs. With his mother not being home, Docman was forced to take to the streets for that attention. On January 27, 2004, LG was hanging outside of a nightclub in Manhattan. At approximately 12:35 AM, a black SUV parked at the end of the block. As LG proceeded to walk down the street, 3 masked men jumped out of the car and short Gibson to death. Docman was in his neighborhood when a couple of his close friends came to inform him. Three years later, Docman, Nathanial, and his mother moved to Virginia. After two years, Docman moved to Houston, TX. In 2006, Docman lived in Alief (the southwest side of Houston). He attended Budewig Intermediate School. In 2007, He moved to the South East side attending Thompson Intermediate. While at Thompson, Docman formed a group called JHC, or Junior Hustle Click. The group consisted of TBronz, Babyboy, DJ Roybass, and JK. In the beginning they weren\u2019t rappers; they sold bubble gum to help pay for school lunches. At the time the only rapper was TBronz. He influenced Docman to rap, and from then on, Docman dedicated himself to the music. Docman didn\u2019t start rapping in 2007. His journey started back in 2004 when his cousin was killed. Before his cousin\u2019s demise, LG would freestyle on the corners of New York while he sold drugs. Docman, being around him all the time, was amazed by the love he was getting off of making words rhyme. While his cousin was on his death bed, he told Docman to \u201cnever let anyone get in between him and success.\u201d Docman says, \u201cI rap because it helps me connect with him.\u201d Back when his cousin was on the corner selling drugs, Docman would always want to participate. Everything his older cousin would do, he would try to emulate. So, in-turn, everyone in the neighborhood nicknamed him \u201cDown On Crime\u201d. After a while, Maurice shortened it to Doc. As Doc became more into rap, he felt the need to change his name. At the time Robinson was very into Wu-Tang and Def Squad. He was particularly into Method Man and Redman. When Doc finally decided to change his name, he followed suit and added \u201cman\u201d at the end of \u201cdoc\u201d. From 2008 to 2012, Docman has released 20 underground mixtapes under the name Doc with his group, JHC. In 2015, Docman decided it was time to start cashing in on his talents. On April 17, 2015, Docman released his debut EP, The DOCument. The EP gained much respect with major tastemakers as numerous blogs raved about the blend between underground lyrics and mainstream production. Docman decided to go on his first tour in the summer of 2015. The tour stopped in 5 cities: Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, and New York. Now Docman is the CEO of his own label, Empier Entertainment (Not Empire); and is planning on dropping a full length album in the summer of 2016.

He is an integral figure in birthing a new sound and style of hip hop that has gained wide influence since it first broke in underground circles in 2017, and MIKE's music itself carries the insight, pain, and fatigue that often comes with age and long life lived. Born in New Jersey, MIKE moved to London with his mother before settling in The Bronx for the remainder of his later teenage years. Both regions have had an audible influence on the young rapper's music - in England he was immersed in grime and the music of King Krule, and in the United States he was turned on to Earl Sweatshirt and MF DOOM. In New York, MIKE connected with several artists who had a similar ear and style, and formed a collective called [sLUms]. Consisting of Ad\u00e9 Hakim, Darryl Johnson, King Carter, Jazz Jodi, and DJ Mason, the group established a unique sound that created waves throughout underground hip hop circles across the country. In 2017 MIKE released his mixtape May God Bless Your Hustle. The project perfectly captured a singular moment in a city where the only constant is change. With features from Standing on the Corner, Wiki, Mal Devisa, and more, as well as production from Ade Hakim, Tony Seltzer, and Austin Williamson of Onyx Collective, May God Bless Your Hustle was a snapshot of the sound of underground New York rap in 2017. It received a Best New Music review from Pitchfork as MIKE started to gain international attention outside of New York City. At the end of 2018 MIKE released his album War In My Pen independently, and followed it up in mid 2019 with Tears of Joy, his second album to be selected for Pitchfork\u2019s Best New Music. He released his most recent album, Weight of the World, in 2020. Nearly entirely self-produced, and only containing features from Jadasea and Earl Sweatshirt, it\u2019s one of MIKE\u2019s most introspective and sonically diverse releases to date. MIKE has opened tours for Blood Orange and Earl Sweatshirt, and performed at festivals such as MoMA PS1 Warm Up, Pitchfork Festival, and Capitol Hill Block Party. Over the past year MIKE immersed himself in electronic and house music, listening to artists such as Steve Spacek and Park Hye Jin. He released two largely instrumental projects partially inspired by these new influences: BLP2020 \u201cKing of the Night\u201d and BLP2021 \"for ur own good.\" Disco! is the first MIKE release since Weight of the World, and sees MIKE combine his new style of production with his top tier songwriting and delivery. The project is at times more upbeat and catchy than his previous work, but still carries the emotional weight that is characteristic of MIKE's music. The result is MIKE's most engaging and interesting body of work to date, as he continues to evolve the style of rap that he pioneered.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3600 Presidential Blvd, Austin, TX 78719", "Artist": "Brad Stivers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9144519.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2049088, -97.6671315], "Date": "2021-07-26", "EventDate": "Jul. 26th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "3:00 PM", "Venue": "Brad Stivers At The Airport ", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Must have plane tickets to gain access to airport terminal to see the show."}, {"Address": "8989 FM 150, Driftwood, TX 78619", "Artist": "W.C.

Their music is somehow familiar, yet can leave you feeling like an outsider who has just witnessed something very real, painfully beautiful, and ultimately redeeming. Regardless of how their music grabs you, a Choctaw Wildfire performance might be the most genuine thing you've heard in a very long time.

He has toured with Rosie Flores and Dale Watson, appeared on Austin City Limits (with Watson), and can be found on recordings by the Derailers, Chaparral, Charlie Burton, and the LaSalles among others.

Several demos, a few years, a new group name, and additional members later, the direction of the crew took its turn towards blending science fiction and conspiracy theories into rap songs, which at the time, was a rare take on hip hop music in the early 90s. In 1994, the early \"Demigodz\" group split up due to the ever-so-popular break up reason: \"musical differences\". However, it was through this transition that the Demigodfather met another fellow CT lyricist, Apathy. As the musical partnership between Open Mic and Apathy progressed, the two decided to rebuild the Demigodz name and take their aspirations to an entirely different level. After years of recording songs, mastering the ASR-10, co-hosting a radio show, and gaining ties with the likes of Alien Nation, Mothership aka Eternia, and Al T of Newcleus, Mic's dues were slowly but surely being paid. Along with Apathy, he also headed up a Connecticut based chapter of the Universal Zulu Nation and recorded the cassette-only \"Sureshot Affair\" EP, which was self-released in 1997 and sold throughout the underground circles of the North East. Shortly thereafter, Mic took a step back from the scene after getting married and becoming a father for the first time in his life... In 2000, the Demigodz became resurrected by Apathy and expanded into a military-like squadron of MCs and DJs. With that movement in motion, it couldn't have existed without the inclusion of its original creator, Open Mic, and once again he became immersed into the hip hop world. Since then, Mic has kept himself afloat by making appearances on wax, including \"Science of the Bumrush\" on UK-based Stonegroove Recordings and the Demigodz EP released on Ill Boogie Records in mid-2002, all of which received critical acclaim in such publications as XXL and The Source. Outside of the microphone realm, he has made quite a name for himself over the years as a professional graphic designer, in which his lengthy resume extends widely with the creation of many 12\" single, vinyl album, and CD covers for an extensive list of labels - beginning with Bronx Science Records (Apathy's first label), Raptivism Records, Domination Recordings and most recently Babygrande. In early 2006, after being reunited with early 'Nobility' member and co-founder of the first generation of the Demigodz, P-Air, Open Mic has begun work on a new duo project. Returning to his original group base from 1989-1990, and bringing back that boom-bap early 90's sound that hip-hop has lacked since it took a commercial nosedive, Open Mic is ready to deliver what many Demigodz fans have been asking for.... the real raw shit.

From her high-energy worship projects for kids and her new adult-focused worship album, Yancy\u2019s musical influence is inspiring the entire family to worship, learn and rejoice in the Lord. Comb through Yancy\u2019s credits and you will find her exploring a variety of projects and genres, including a series of pop/rock releases, a Christmas collection and multiple CD and DVD releases. She has toured with acts like Newsboys, Mute Math and Nichole Nordeman; while on the writing side of the coin, she\u2019s teamed up with Third Day\u2019s Mac Powell, co-penned Avalon\u2019s chart topping \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Go\u201d (off the Grammy nominated Oxygen album) and Jaci Velesquez\u2019s acclaimed \u201cSomething Beautiful,\u201d while still finding the time to compose devotional books for worship leaders and musicians as well as one for her pre-teen audience. She even launched a father/daughter-speaking event with her dad and veteran minister, Jim Wideman. Add in five years as a staff worship leader conducting services for every age group imaginable, and Yancy has literally run the entire gamut of enthusiastic diversification. \u201cI knew from a very young age that God had called me to make music with my life. Although I was very confident of that calling growing up, I couldn\u2019t imagine the amazing journey God has taken me on that would be a part of fulfilling that calling,\u201d reflects Yancy. Her latest project, \u201cRoots For The Journey,\u201d is coming to stores on May 21st via distribution partner Elevate Entertainment. \u201cRoots for the Journey is incredibly different musically from what I\u2019ve done these past few years,\u201d says Yancy about the album. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this music that is unplugged, organic and simple. The songs are all based on scripture and the outcome is a really nice chilled-out worship experience that I know adults are going to really enjoy. There will be a companion app that helps parents teach these scriptures and Biblical truths to their children which will be a cool resource for the family.\u201d Inspired to extend her musical influence to the parents and church leaders her children focused-music has equipped over the years, Yancy\u2019s adult-focused album, \u201cRoots For The Journey\u201d was born out of an organic process that caught her by surprise. Yancy explains, \u201cI started off making this a lullaby CD. Taking key scriptures and truths that I wanted to pass on to my son and make sure he knew and understood the direction and answer these scriptures provide us.

The album puts into context a far-reaching exploration into the many channels of influence this band possesses. Synthesizing tradition with elements of South American and African psychedelia through imaginary landscapes inviting the listener into what is without a doubt a sonic trip towards resignified roots and ancestry. Senior Editor at Rolling Stone Magazine David Fricke gave Hycha Wy a 4-star review on UK\u2019s MOJO Magazine calling it \u201c Rhythmic ambition and spiritual verve, this power-trance trio is a genuine pan-American thrill, fusing shamanistic pulse, cumbia-via-New Order, garage blues minimalism, and Bay Area- \u201860s psychedelia as if the were all native tongues.\u201d To cope with being an immigrant preteen growing up in the late 90\u2019s USA, Victor-Andres Cruz \"El Gu\u00e1mbito\" obsessed over Colombian traditional music and instruments as a defense mechanism.

Raised as an amalgamation between the Colombian Andean countryside, Florida, New England, and New York City, Victor created a voice and a place where all worlds converge.

Comb through Yancy\u2019s credits and you will find her exploring a variety of projects and genres, including a series of pop/rock releases, a Christmas collection and multiple CD and DVD releases. She has toured with acts like Newsboys, Mute Math and Nichole Nordeman; while on the writing side of the coin, she\u2019s teamed up with Third Day\u2019s Mac Powell, co-penned Avalon\u2019s chart topping \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Go\u201d (off the Grammy nominated Oxygen album) and Jaci Velesquez\u2019s acclaimed \u201cSomething Beautiful,\u201d while still finding the time to compose devotional books for worship leaders and musicians as well as one for her pre-teen audience.

The songs are all based on scripture and the outcome is a really nice chilled-out worship experience that I know adults are going to really enjoy.

Consequently, his music is a combination of familiar sounds that cannot be made to fit neatly into one genre. Manzy's musical influences began with his grandmother's love for the folk and hymns along with his brother's love for rock and roll with a blues flair. In college, Manzy was introduced to the sounds of The Band, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Tom Petty, and Jason Boland. Inspired, he picked up a guitar and soon began playing, writing, and performing. Manzy is now known for his original ballads that are rough around the edges and dusty like an old book left on the shelf. His stories can paint pictures that transport your mind to a particular place in time. Manzy's compositions are unique and authentic even if that means going against popular demand. The result: a sound that you didn't know you were missing. Manzy has traveled all across the United States and released two albums since 2012. His third album, Warm Wine, is a collection of stories ranging from sweet to difficult times or a cross between the two. Produced and recorded by David Beck at Fast Horse Studios, Warm Wine is due to be released in the summer of 2018. Faced with the difficulty of categorizing his own music, Manzy asks that you give a listen and decide for yourself. Manzy has opened for popular bands including Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Dean Dillon, Hayes Carll, Corb Lund, Shane Smith and the Saints. He has shared the stage with The Tallent Brothers, The Possum Posse, Doug Moreland, and Mike and the Moonpies. In 2014, Manzy was accepted into The Last Honky Tonk Music Series.

BettySoo's shows are ever-changing and entertaining - as much for what is said off the cuff between songs as for the songwriting and her breathtaking delivery. Backed by her band in Austin, Texas, she's garnered her share of great show reviews on top of the critical success her albums have achieved.

BettySoo's songwriting awards include: Kerrville New Folk Award, Mountain Stage NewSong Winner, Wildflower!

Her new album draws comparisons to Patty Griffin, Ryan Adams, and Kathleen Edwards \u2013 all writers who know how to craft a heartbreakingly beautiful song with just enough grit to keep you enthralled. Harris writes about the basic human experience, in a way that is simple, poetic, and often painfully relatable. \"You keep comin over... I keep goin under...\" Harris isn\u2019t afraid to get personal, but her vulnerability never veers into the self-indulgent. Each little confessional gem she puts out there is something the listener will connect to; these are things we\u2019ve all felt, though many of us are less than likely to admit them. \u201cIn a depressive state\u2026 how long will I feel this way?\u201d Harris's songs have a depth to them, and her lyrics betray a wisdom beyond her years. \u201cI write as a way of dealing with things,\" she says. \"There\u2019s also a lot of acknowledging my own faults. These songs feel pretty vulnerable\u2026 to the point where I wonder if people are going to ask me \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 But I really just hope they see a little bit of themselves in the songs and find something they can connect to.\u201d Jaimee grew up in Waco, TX, a child to young parents, high school sweethearts. When she was five years old, her father noticed that she had taken an interest in music, and got her a guitar for Christmas. Soon after, she discovered Emmylou Harris and Fleetwood Mac, and before long, the kid was hooked. Harris\u2019s father took her down to Austin for the first ever Austin City Limits Festival, and there she saw Emmylou, Buddy & Julie Miller, and Patty Griffin all perform live. Her father had only brought enough extra money to pay for a hotel in Austin that evening, but when he saw how much Jaimee wanted those CDs in the merch tent, he ponied up the cash and drove all the way back to Waco late that night. Harris grew up, as kids do, and moved to Austin in 2009. She intended to throw herself into the local music scene, playing shows and singing songs late into the night at friend\u2019s houses, but she fell into a hard-partying crowd, and soon enough, things started to fall apart. \u201cAfter I got arrested for the second time, I knew I needed to get sober,\u201d says Harris. \u201cBy that point, I knew I was really on my own\u2026 everyone close to me had stopped enabling me. I knew I had to get myself together in order to stand on my own feet.\u201d Once she was able to clean up her act, Harris says, everything just seemed easier. That\u2019s when she began writing the songs that would make up her debut record, including \u201cSnow White Knuckles\u201d which chronicles her path to sobriety. It\u2019s also when she started meeting the musicians who would soon join her live band, and the artists, including people like BettySoo and Jimmy LaFave, who would be become her creative mentors. \u201cI am especially impressed with some of the new songwriters that have hit town in the last few years, like my new favorite Jaimee Harris,\u201d commented LaFave. And he\u2019s not the only one who was impressed. Peter Blackstock of the Austin-American Statesman has called Harris \u201cone of Austin\u2019s most promising young singer-songwriters.\u201d And all this before she even released her first record. Harris\u2019s talent is undeniable. But what sets her apart more than anything is her admittedly \u201cobsessive\u201d love of music. \u201cJaimee is, deep down, a true music fan; she is passionate about consuming as much great music as she can,\u201d says BettySoo. \u201cJaimee is known among our circle of friends for attending more shows than seems humanly possible, and she's not doing it out of FOMO or to be 'seen on the scene.' She goes because she's a fan.\u201d \u201cMusic is my whole life,\u201d says Harris, \u201cIf I\u2019m not writing or playing, I\u2019m going to see a band, or reading a book about Woody Guthrie. I live in a city where I can walk in and see an amazing show like James McMurtry practically for free, every week. I only made it through one semester of college, but being around these amazing songwriters here in Austin\u2026 It\u2019s like getting an education.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2015 E Riverside Dr Bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741", "Artist": "Roc Holiday ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6959044.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2400045, -97.7276248], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Metal, Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Come and Take It Live", "moreBioInfo": "Roc Holiday - performed by current and former members of: Bad Company, Molly Hatchet, Dangerous Toys, Dirty Looks, LC.Rocks Austin TX Classic Rock Band", "otherInfo": "Come and Take It Productions presents WILDSTREET!"}, {"Address": "2015 E Riverside Dr Bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741", "Artist": "The Rumours ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11514435.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2400045, -97.7276248], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Glam Rock N Roll, Riot Grrrl, Rock N Roll, Punk Rock & Roll", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Come and Take It Live", "moreBioInfo": "The Rumours are a rock band based out of Waterloo, IA.

Forsyth (vocals, acoustic, electric, & slide guitar, harmonica, ukulele, singing saw), along with Will Landin (bass/tuba) and Rob Hooper (drums/Cajon), bring a unique mixture of styles such as folk, rock, country, and Tin Pan Alley to create a sound that\u2019s as heterogeneous, raw and compelling as America itself. You\u2019ll hear powerhouse vocals deliver energetic yarns about love, the government and the apocalypse, to name a few, as Forsyth and company squeeze everything they have into each song and rarely come up for air. Forsyth brought his skills as a stellar live performer to help found and make infamous nationwide the theatrical acoustic group The Asylum Street Spankers. He gave Wammo his first washboard and Christina Marrs her first guitar and ukelele. His time with the Spankers touring and recording 5 albums added to a wealth of earlier unique experiences in his life \u2013 working as a stuntman in renaissance shows, busking on the streets of New Orleans and playing on a mountain top in Nepal \u2013 which provided him musical fodder to be refined in the songs of Forsyth\u2019s numerous solo albums. The release of his latest, Calico Girl, which features new songs as well as re-recordings of some of Guy\u2019s most popular songs from 1999's Can You Live Without, marks the fourth album for the record label he started in 2002, Small and Nimble Records. Guy is known today as a musician with gripping, powerful vocals as well as a master of numerous instruments. He started his musical development first with singing, and began playing harmonica at 16. Shortly thereafter he heard a very distinct and overwhelming sound on Kansas City radio that changed his life; it was Robert Johnson. After that, he borrowed a guitar, fell in love and learned to tune it with his feet from a friend who had lost both his arms in an accident. In college, he lasted a single semester at the University of Kansas, and then he found the music he had been seeking \u2013 gritty, organic folk and blues, \u201cfrom a practical hands-on, gears, joints and joists level.\u201d And he struck out to learn it. Since then, he\u2019s been awarded an Austin Music Award for Best Male Vocalist in 2005, as well as numerous other AMA\u2019s over the years in categories such as Blues and Best Miscellaneous Instrument Player (singing saw), among others. Last year\u2019s 2-disc live record, Unrepentant Schizophrenic Americana, was received very well by critics and fans alike. In the past year, Forsyth has stepped up his touring significantly to reach fans in the Southwest, Southeast, East Coast, and Midwest United States, as well as continuing to play in Europe several times each year. Guy has been featured in a number of large festivals recently, including the Austin City Limits Music Fest in 2005 and 2007 (Austin), High Sierra Music Festival (Northern California), Los Alamos Festival (New Mexico), BBQ & Blues Festival (New York), Tonder Festival (Denmark), and Rhythm \u2018n\u2019 Blues Festival (Belgium). He will continue broadening his tour base throughout 2008, taking his live show to new cities and festivals. His confirmed appearances upcoming this year include Chicago\u2019s American Music Festival, the Ottowa Blues Fest, Kerrville Folk Festival and Rochester\u2019s Bricktown Festival.
