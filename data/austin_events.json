An anchored mindset that has led this Texas country music rising star from a drifter\u2019s adolescence to the jeopardous game of the rodeo circuit to the punishing toil of the Texas oil fields, and on into the fickle arms of the music business. Some might argue whether it is having nine consecutive #1 hit singles in Texas under his belt that has garnered him staying power, or that he is killing it in the social media world with over 2 million views on YouTube and over 3 million streams globally on Spotify. Maybe it\u2019s his 3 venerated album releases, or maybe because he can not only bat a full house on a 200 plus dates a year touring average, but also rope in crowds on a first time performance in an unfamiliar town. While impressive, all those distinctions can come and go in the world of music. The reason for his staying power turns out to be quite a simple one. And that is because Josh Ward is country music blood to bone, and both Josh Ward and country music are simply not going to go away. Josh spent 2017 heavily touring off the strength of his previous album \u201cHolding Me Together.\u201d All six radio singles hit the #1 spot on the Texas Regional Radio Chart and Ward quickly found himself going from opening act to the headlining spot in a matter of months. But in the midst of his growing popularity, he gladly bent the knee to fellow country music artist and comrade Cody Johnson who introduced Ward to his West Coast audiences. Getting the chance to be endorsed by Cody Johnson and perform at sold out shows in brand new markets is the kind of opportunity music artists chomp at the bit to have. When Ward and his band returned to those areas a few months later all by their lonesome, he simply could not have guessed at the reception he would encounter. \u201cWhen we went back to the West Coast by ourselves, it was sold out shows. I was literally blown away.\u201d It was at that very point while far away from his familiar stomping grounds in Texas with new fans slapping him on the back that Ward knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that his music was catching on in a big way. The culmination of his radio success and his victories out on the road can easily be attributed to the actual man behind the music. In life, sometimes a person gets dealt a lean hand and has to choose his family from strangers along the way, people who make a conscious choice to take you under their wing and help guide you through life. Ward considers himself a very lucky man despite some rough teenage years. The love and support of his extended family and his chosen family was the concrete foundation he built his life on, and his fans are a big part of that. It\u2019s why they are drawn to him through the speakers, because he is what he sings. It\u2019s why they are drawn to him from the stage, because he\u2019s an old friend who\u2019s come back to visit. He\u2019s the animated truth of all he stands for, a self-made family man who always has a welcome smile and an open spot in the family. To his loyal fans he feels he owes everything. \u201cWords can\u2019t describe the emotion that gets put into these runs and the work that we do. And these people pay their hard earned money to see it every night. Thank you. Every time I step on stage, you guys remind me that I have more than I deserve.\u201d And so his brand new album, so aptly named, is Ward\u2019s dedication to his growing family. \u201cMore Than I Deserve\u201d marks Ward\u2019s fourth full length album release and it will greet the fans on May 4, 2018. With the philosophy of \u201cdon\u2019t fix what isn\u2019t broken,\u201d Ward went right back into the Rosewood studios where he recorded all his previous releases and joined producer Greg Hunt once again behind the board to create the next dimension of Josh Ward country music. The new album is 11 tracks strong featuring the signature instrumentation from guys like John Carroll (Cory Morrow) on guitar, Nate Coon (Aaron Watson) on drums, Milo Deering (The Eagles) on acoustic guitar, steel, dobro, fiddle, viola and mandolin, and Terry McBride (McBride and The Ride) on backing vocals and also writer of three of the tracks. The album is classic Josh Ward style on every front with just a little more gusto and a little more miles on it. Full bodied and emotionally fragrant, every song jumps out kicking up the kind of country music nostalgia Ward is revered for. The first single \u201cAll About Lovin\u2019\u201d (written by Brice Long, Terry McBride and Chris Stapleton) tells you everything you need to know about this album, a sexy tonkafied driver of a song that guarantees you\u2019ll be lacing up your dancing shoes by the time you hit the chorus. \u201cHome Away From Home\u201d is country piled on top of more country, and is, as the song says, \u201ca two steppin\u2019 juke box heaven.\u201d While Ward has never been afraid to sing other people\u2019s songs due to his belief that a good song simply needs to be heard, his own savvy for the art just so happens to be represented on three of the most powerful tracks. \u201cA Cowboy Can\u201d is the true grit of this album and is what Ward says best describes himself. \u201cOne More Shot Of Whiskey\u201d is a sobering tale told with 90 proof conviction, and then there is \u201cMore Than I Deserved\u201d ringing out with its vulnerable steel and head hanging resolve. \u201cMore Than I Deserve\u201d is country music addiction in its purest form. Josh Ward did not reinvent the wheel here, but damn, it\u2019s polished surface sure rides smooth. Josh and his band will be seeing a lot more of the country this year hitting a lot of new places on his never ending tour. It\u2019s still hard for him to believe he has come this far and he doesn\u2019t take one mile of it for granted. \u201cI never thought I would be rolling down the road with one of the hottest bands in Texas playing shows across the United States. I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d", "otherInfo": "KOKEFEST 2021 at Hutto Park at Brushy Creek Friday and Saturday, August 6-7, 2021.\n\nKOKEFEST 2021 will feature Koe Wetzel, Clay Walker, Aaron Watson, Pat Green, Kevin Fowler, Read Southall Band, Josh Ward, Cody Canada & The Departed, Mike Ryan, Giovannie & The Hired Guns, Kylie Frey and Austin Meade.

But there\u2019s a growing movement within the genre suffering no such identity crisis, and there you\u2019ll find Kylie Frey. Born and raised as country as it gets, Frey is a third-generation rodeo girl and Louisiana state goat-tying champion \u2013 and a rising star as genuine as her Wranglers.

Each one displays the true-to-yourself grit and determination that rodeo demands, and to Frey, those qualities can only be earned the hard way. Rodeo was a family tradition, she says \u2026 and so was country. With Rodeo Queen, she embraces the idea that individuality is more than relatable \u2026 it\u2019s contagious. Built around Frey\u2019s own story \u2013 one of a girl coming to terms with who she is and what lies ahead \u2013 it features a sound that\u2019s equally sure of itself and a vocal just as pure.", "otherInfo": "Kylie Frey will be performing at Kokefest - 2021 in Hutto, Texas on August 6th, 2021."}, {"Address": "1001 Co Rd 137, Hutto, TX 78634", "Artist": "Kevin Fowler ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6606142.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.5056422, -97.5447995], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "KOKEFEST 2021", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102562454-kevin-fowler-at-hutto-park-at-brushy-creek?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Reflection is the catalyst to coming full circle. Texas country singer-songwriter Kevin Fowler took a couple of years to take stock of his artistic career, launch his own record label, then write and record How Country Are Ya? the old-fashioned way. How Country Are Ya? \u2013 Fowler\u2019s seventh studio album and his first for Kevin Fowler Records in a joint venture with Nashville\u2019s Thirty Tigers - is the good-timing, tradition-steeped and honky-tonk-stomping Amarillo native\u2019s return to basics effort. A year in the making, the album features 15 fresh tunes (he wrote all of them except for the raucous instrumental \u201cMousturdonus\u201c) and was produced by Ken Tondre, Fowler\u2019s drummer, at Tondre\u2019s The Compound Recording Studio in Austin. One of the most potent songs on How Country Are Ya? is \u201cPanhandle Poorboy,\u201d a completely autobiographical piece that\u2019s clearly the centerpiece of Fowler\u2019s mindset during the creation of the disc. Simply put, he wanted to come back home. \u201cThe last couple of records have been on Nashville record labels,\u201d Fowler said, referring to 2007\u2019s Bring It On, released on Equity Music Group, and 2011\u2019s Chippin\u2019 Away, released on Average Joe\u2019s Entertainment. \u201cBut this one is on my own label with my buddies like we used to make records. I wanted to feel right at home, go back to the well, and not get into any outside influences. I really felt like I wanted to make music closer to all my anthems that people scream along to at shows.\u201d Plus, How Country Are Ya? is chock full of Texas-centric collaborations. Earl Dibbles Jr., the alter-ego of Dallas-bred Granger Smith, provides the disc\u2019s no-nonsense intro. Amy Rankin, one half of Austin\u2019s The Rankin Twins, croons with Fowler on the emotionally evocative number \u201cBefore Somebody Gets Hurt.\u201d San Antonio\u2019s Grammy winners Los Texmaniacs crank up the South-of-the-border ambiance of \u201cBorracho Grande.\u201d Kingwood, Texas\u2019 rebel-rouser Davin James lends his big personality to the hilarious \u201cChicken Wing.\u201d And Huntsville, Texas newcomer Cody Johnson stirs straight-up country action on \u201cGuitars and Guns.\u201d See? Told ya Fowler threw a studio party with his good friends and turned it into a record. But of course the first single, \u201cHow Country Are Ya?,\u201d is quintessential Fowler. The song crackles with all the beer joint energy that characterizes every creative fiber in Kevin Fowler\u2019s body. The point behind each lyric, each guitar lick, and each twanging-rocking melody is the live show. Fowler has earned his reputation as one of the most amped-up concert performers to emerge from the modern day Texas country movement. For those that have experienced Fowler onstage, then you know he brings unbridled musical muscle to the platform. Backed by his trusty band he\u2019s a dynamo \u2013 cracking jokes, hitting high notes, strumming his guitar and putting each of his fans in two-stepping mode. \u201cFrom day one I realized I couldn\u2019t control what radio played and what video channels played, but the one thing I could control every night was the live show,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cThe musicians want to be there, the fans want to be there and I want to be there. People can listen to the CDs at home. But if they come to the shows they are ready to have a good time for an hour-and-a-half, forget about their problems and forget about work on Monday.\u201d Pretty much any city in Texas belongs to Fowler, but he will immediately point out that he is quickly growing in Oklahoma a And anyone who\u2019s ever been to a Kevin Fowler show knows he does far more than just talk the talk\u2014the man delivers one of the most entertaining, high-energy performances you\u2019re likely to see in country or any other genre, with a hard-ticket base that rivals many gold-selling artists. A blend of in-your-face rockin\u2019 intensity, tongue-in-cheek humor and captivating country storytelling, Kevin\u2019s music has his standing-room-only audiences hanging on every word . . . and singing right along with him. Whether it\u2019s \u201cBeer, Bait and Ammo,\u201d \u201cCheaper to Keep Her,\u201d \u201cThe Best Mistake I Ever Made,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Willie\u201d or any of the other unforgettable tunes that have seen him regularly perched atop the Texas music charts, Kevin\u2019s music is the product of years spent perfecting his craft. And he\u2019s not the only beneficiary. Other artists, like Montgomery Gentry (\u201cLong Line of Losers\u201d), Mark Chesnutt (\u201cThe Lord Loves a Drinkin\u2019 Man\u201d) and George Jones (dueting with Kevin on \u201cMe and the Boys\u201d), are among those who have recorded classic versions of Fowler songs. With his career track record, it would be easy to assume Kevin must\u2019ve always known music would be his life\u2019s passion. After all, how can you be this good at something and not have worked at it for a lifetime? But he admits coming to his career path later in the game than most. \u201cThere was a day in life that changed me,\u201d Kevin recalls of the transformative epiphany he experienced at the Texas Jam in the Cotton Bowl back when he was about 20 years old. \u201cI had been dabblin\u2019 in music and played everything a little, but nothing well. Aerosmith was there. White Snake. All these bands were playing at a day-long festival. They were hosing down the crowd with big fire hoses. And it was just mayhem. I had never seen 100,000 people in one place. I remember that day going, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to be doin\u2019.\u2019\u201d While Amarillo boy Kevin may not have had a clear vision of his life\u2019s path prior to that momentous day, he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when he finally realized he was put on this earth to write songs and entertain people. After all, he\u2019d been entertaining in one way or another since his attention-seeking days as a self-described \u201cband geek,\u201d playing drums in junior high and high school. But Kevin\u2019s musical training had begun earlier when his mom, Shirley, insisted he take piano lessons, in spite of his hatred of it and his desire to play football instead. Looking back, he thinks his folks made the right call. \u201cThey were probably thinkin\u2019 to themselves, \u2018We\u2019ve seen you play football\u2014that\u2019s no good!\u2019\u201d he laughs. While Kevin recalls knee-knocking piano recitals as his first experience with live performing, his first taste of country music came through the records his dad played\u2014Johnny Horton, Johnny Cash, Buck Owens and Roy Clark. Kevin, of course, rebelled and gravitated more toward rockers AC/DC, Kiss, The Cars, Metallica, and other decidedly non-country bands. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018til later on in life that I thought, \u2018that (country) stuff was really cool.\u2019\u201d Kevin recalls Amarillo as a good place to grow up, but entertainment options were, let\u2019s say, limited. That meant 16-year-old Kevin and some buddies might sneak a 6-pack of beer on a Friday night, head down the road a few miles to tiny Vega\u2014a town of under 1,000 people\u2014find an old dirt road and \u201chide out.\u201d Let the good times roll! So, was there a little culture shock when Kevin moved to California a few years later? \u201cIt was like fallin\u2019 right off the turnip wagon,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was in shock.\u201d The move to L.A. came after Kevin, then a junior at West Texas A&M in Canyon, saw that life-changing show at the Cotton Bowl. With 100 credits toward a business degree, he quit school and went to the coast to study at the G.I.T guitar institute. While there, he learned how incredibly competitive the music world really is. So, was he intimidated? \u201cNo. It was just an eye opener. My mama always persisted in telling me, \u2018Whatever you\u2019re gonna do, don\u2019t be a quitter.\u2019 That\u2019s why she never would let me quit piano music. Somebody told me one time, \u2018You\u2019ve gotta stay in the game long enough to get lucky.\u2019\u201d After finishing school in L.A., Kevin\u2014a road warrior at heart\u2014realized that paying gigs were few and far between in Los Angeles. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I got into music . . . to play live,\u201d says Kevin, who\u2019ll do about 150 shows this year . . . slightly fewer than usual because of time spent writing and recording. So he left L.A. and tested the waters elsewhere. \u201cA friend lived in Austin. I was gonna go there, then I was gonna check out Nashville and figure out where I needed to be. When I got to Austin, that 5-day visit turned into a permanent stay. Been there ever since.\u201d Not long after his move to Austin, Kevin joined a band that became Rumble Train, but soon discovered he was the only with any motivation. Then he fell in with long-haired rockers Dangerous Toys (yep, short-haired, cowboy hat-wearing Kevin was in a hard rock band\u2014there\u2019s a rumor photos exist!). And, not surprisingly, they had a problem with Kevin\u2019s tunes. \u201c\u2018Man, these are redneck songs! We can\u2019t play any of these.\u2019\u201d So, in a move that was more necessity than intention, Kevin began singing them himself. And Kevin, the rocker who also wore out two cassettes of George Strait\u2019s Right or Wrong album, found a way to combine the best of both worlds. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked rock, for the attitude and the energy. But I\u2019ve always liked the country lyric. It just tells a story. And I try to combine those elements . . . make it rockin\u2019 and fun with a good lyric in there, a good turn of a phrase.\u201d That ability has given Kevin more than a decade of success in his Texas stomping grounds where he is embraced with a vengeance by audiences who love him and his music. But he wants more. Ultimately, Kevin knows he only has control over one thing in his career. \u201cWhat you do onstage . . . nobody can make you sound crappy but you. That\u2019s Kevin Fowler Music 101 in a nutshell. Make it about the fans, the live show and the music. And hopefully everything else will come from there.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "11721 Rock Rose Ave #100, Austin, TX 78758", "Artist": "Josh Klaus Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11000761.jpeg", "Coordinates": ["", ""], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop, Acoustic", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Culinary Dropout", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102792107-josh-klaus-music-at-culinary-dropout?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Josh Klaus can be summed in two words: Passionate and professional.

Also in the circle are members of Jet and Lucero. Graham Parsons demonstrates country stylings to Keith, while Mick Taylor rambles on slide. Jagger and Freddie King wail in unison like old, drunken friends. That should give you an idea of the influence, as well as the broad listener appeal found in Austin based THE BIG GUN SHOW. It\u2019s not uncommon to have lied, lusted or done something wrong in your life - Everyone has been disappointed and most have had their confidence ruined. These are the life experience topics of that consumed songwriter, Gunter Woodson, as he wrote the 5-song concept EP titled THE DOOR. Gunter met Yates Hagan in 2010 when Yates was playing drums with alt-rock Phoenix Down and Gunter was leading the acoustic songwriting duo, Long Woodson. Over many boozy evenings they talked of each wanting a more upbeat and rocking stage show with music influenced by what Gunter calls the Stones \u201cGolden Era.\u201d He defines it as the period from 69 to 73 when Mick Taylor was playing slide and Parsons was exuding his sway on Keith. In short, it was inevitable that THE BIG GUN SHOW would begin. The EP was recorded and produced by AJ Vallejo (Austin producer of the year 2014 and 2015) in his studio. Gunter and Yates joined forces with him to massage the songs into what is now their current form. The final product brims with music gems that concern emotions and encounters that both members discovered along their life\u2019s journeys. \u201cSwagger\u201d exudes someone getting their confidence back and \u201cChablis and Weed\u201d talks to a guy desiring a woman who has other priorities than him. The idea of doing something forbidden came to life with \u201cBehind the Barn\u201d after reading Stones sax player\u2019s, Bobby Keys, autobiography. \u201cBitch\u201d conveys disappointment and \u201cBegin to Begin\u201d engages the true struggle of honesty. Taking in and re-familiarizing oneself with these feeling and life experiences demonstrates the truth in what THE BIG GUN SHOW is saying.

The Ohio-bred and Texas-Transplanted band\u2019s first new music since 2015\u2019s Restless Ones, A Beautiful Life affirms frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom as a songwriter with the power to profoundly influence our state of mind, often by alchemizing her idealism into viscerally potent rock-and-roll songs. With its delicate coalescence of so many eclectic touchstones\u2014French pop and Celtic folk, space rock and symphonic pop, Disney scores and post-punk\u2014the result is an album that immediately lures the listener into a more receptive mindset, one that leads to deeper generosity, greater compassion, and a restored sense of possibility. Co-produced by Wennerstrom and Kevin Ratterman (Strand Of Oaks, Jim James, White Reaper), A Beautiful Life finds Wennerstrom joining forces with the likes of guitarist Lauren Gurgiolo (Okkervil River), drummer Greggory Clifford (White Denim), multi-instrumentalist Jesse Chandler (Mercury Rev, Midlake), keyboardist Bo Koster (My Morning Jacket), guitarist David Pulkingham (Patty Griffin), and longtime Heartless Bastards bassist Jesse Ebaugh. Although she debated releasing A Beautiful Life as a solo effort (as with 2018\u2019s Sweet Unknown), the Austin-based singer/songwriter ultimately conceived the album as a continuation of the journey begun on the band\u2019s breathlessly acclaimed 2005 debut Stairs and Elevators. \u201cI loved the last iteration of Heartless Bastards so much\u2014they\u2019re like family\u2014but the stars weren\u2019t aligning for us to reconvene on this record,\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cAs the record came together I realized it\u2019s always been my project, and I was determined to continue forth with that. I had so much faith in these songs and in myself, and in many ways it feels like a rebirth.\u201d Like many timeless songwriters before her, Wennerstrom channels her nuanced observation of the outside world into music that incites contemplation, catharsis, and a joyful sense of defiance. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the material goals that are prioritized by our society and the every-man-for-himself mentality of late-stage capitalism,\u201d Wennerstrom says of the album\u2019s central themes. \u201cThat way of thinking presents a false idea of what a beautiful life is, and I think it\u2019s so important that we as individuals all ask ourselves what it truly means to have a beautiful life.\u201d Throughout A Beautiful Life, Heartless Bastards guide their audience through an unhurried pondering of that very question, an exploration that begins with the soulfully expressed frustration of songs like \u201cHow Low.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to choose a simple life; so many people struggle to get ahead so they don\u2019t get left behind,\u201d says Wennerstrom, who names the Jackson 5 as a key inspiration for the track\u2019s jangly R&B grooves. \u201cI believe that a truly elevated, conscious society is one that seeks to lift each other up\u2014one where we work for the common good.\u201d On \u201cYou Never Know,\u201d the band brings in elements of Brazilian bossa nova and y\u00e9-y\u00e9, arriving at a sweetly spirited anthem against jadedness. \u201cAs we get older and experience the pain of certain plans not working out, we can build up walls to protect ourselves,\u201d Wennerstrom says. \u201cThis song is a reminder to stay open, stay present, and keep taking chances.\u201d One of the most hypnotic moments on A Beautiful Life, \u201cPhotograph\u201d unfolds as a sprawling psych-rock epic, speaking to the urgency of unconditional compassion. \u201cThere\u2019s an extreme divide that\u2019s developed in our society, but underneath it all I think we all want the same things,\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve dealt with is learning that I can\u2019t control the energy that comes at me, but I can control my reaction, and try to take a compassionate approach with everyone.\u201d And on \u201cWent Around The World,\u201d Heartless Bastards elegantly merge hip-hop beats and high-drama strings in a mesmerizing meditation on the inherent connectedness of all life. \u201cI\u2019ve toured for years and backpacked around in my off time, and through experiencing new situations I\u2019ve gotten to know parts of myself I\u2019d never known,\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cIt\u2019s reinforced for me that it doesn\u2019t matter what our race or religion is, or whether we\u2019re male or female, straight or LGBTQ\u2014we\u2019re all connected to each other, and to the planet that sustains us. It\u2019s all family.\u201d In the making of Heartless Bastards\u2019 most elaborately realized body of work to date, Wennerstrom immersed herself in a highly experimental process that sometimes involved breathing new life into song fragments she\u2019d first created decades ago. \u201cThere are little pieces of songs that I\u2019ve had in my head for 20 years, and that finally found their place on this album,\u201d she notes. As she dreamed up A Beautiful Life\u2019s finely detailed yet free-flowing sound, Wennerstrom repeatedly wandered down what she lovingly refers to as rabbit tunnels. \u201cI call them tunnels instead of rabbit holes, because they take me somewhere instead of leaving me stuck,\u201d she says. \u201cI allowed myself to really feel my way through things, trusting that I was going to get to where we needed to go. I never abandoned my vision, and because of that the album became everything I hoped it would be and then some.\u201d After recording some of the basic tracking for A Beautiful Life with Danny Reisch in Austin, Wennerstrom headed to Ratterman\u2019s Invisible Creature studio in Los Angeles, assembling such singular musicians as Andrew Bird and Persian setar virtuoso Fared Shafinury (both of whom contributed to the wildly rambling folk of \u201cThe River\u201d). \u201cI made sure to pick people whose style I knew would be a perfect fit for these songs\u2014that way I could tell them, \u2018Hey, I just want you to be you,\u2019\u201d she says. As the album took shape, Wennerstrom and her collaborators discovered an undeniable chemistry that led her to invite Clifford and guitarist Gurgiolo into the lineup for Heartless Bastards\u2019 upcoming live shows, marking the start of an exciting new era for the band. For the final track to A Beautiful Life, Heartless Bastards chose a slow-burning piece called \u201cThe Thinker,\u201d a gently galvanizing plea to \u201csee the beauty in everything.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a line in that song that sums up the whole album for me: \u2018I did it all for love and I\u2019d do it again,\u2019\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cFor me music is a gift\u2014I do it because I love it, and because it helps me feel more connected to the world. I think we all long for a deep connection, and I hope this record adds to the conversation on how we as a species can stop seeing ourselves as separate. I hope it helps everyone to think about how we can look out for each other, take care of each other, and lift each other up.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2015 E Riverside Dr Bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741", "Artist": "Struggle Jennings ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11407002.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2400045, -97.7276248], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Rap", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "STRUGGLE JENNINGS: TROUBADOUR OF TROUBLED SOULS TOUR", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102685571-struggle-jennings-at-come-and-take-it-live?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "The grandson of legendary Country Music icon Waylon Jennings, Struggle is part of a long legacy of Gangsters, Outlaws and Rock Stars..

Her repertoire tells stories of heartbreak and redemption, delivered by a voice that is both rich and clear. Comparisons are frequently drawn to Neko Case, Stevie Nicks and at times she has been anointed a female Tom Petty. However, Nancy Wilson of Heart professed loving Wyatt\u2019s \u201cPunk Rock attitude.\u201d Wyatt is a dynamic performer, dually noted as a powerhouse singer and stellar guitar player, sailing between vintage 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s Country/ Rock/Soul anthems and heartfelt ballads of love and confusion. Originally discovered by Skip Williamson of LA indie label Lakeshore Records while still living in her hometown of Gig Harbor, Washington, she signed her first recording contract at 17. Her Lakeshore Records self-titled EP was produced by Pete Droge, and delivered a windfall with each and every song receiving placement in a major motion picture or soundtrack, some of which included Wicker Park (\u201cLightswitch\"), Midnight Meat Train (song title), and Feast of Love (song title). The track \"Lightswitch\" became a hit at college and indie radio in the U.S., alongside at stations across the European continent. Tiffany, of 80's pop radio fame, covered her composition \"Mind Candy\u201d on her album country album Just Me. This year, Jaime has seen much success with Television. Most notably, a song Wyatt wrote with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers and sang for CALICO the band was featured on ABC\u2019s hit TV show Nashville. Her self-released new album From Outer Space Produced by Mark Howard (Lucinda Williams, Tom Waits, Willie Nelson) hits all digital outlets March 2015. 7\u201d Vinyl and physical CD releases will follow, with several record release shows in Texas for SXSW. Legendary for creating in home environments, as he did with Tom Waits' Real Gone, Producer Mark Howard enjoyed a prolific collaborative partnership with Daniel Lanois for decades. As they began to execute Wyatt's vision, the singer shares, \"It\u2019s definitely a dream come true. When I heard Lucinda Williams\u2019s album World Without Tears I knew there was a special environment and energy being curated. There are performances on the album, which are superior. There\u2019s a tamed chaos that Mark was able to pull out of those players, an energy I have long-since desired on my recordings.\" Howard offers, \"The one thing that struck me about Jaime was that she comes from the same place where Emmy Lou Harris and Lucinda Williams comes from. She has that same soul in her voice and her writing is up to that same greatness. She will be one of the next great singer-songwriters to follow in their footsteps.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2015 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Pi\u2019erre Bourne ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11256470.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2804421, -97.7302326], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Trap, Hip Hop, R&b", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Emos Austin", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102739652-pi'erre-bourne-at-emos-austin?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Pi'erre Bourne is an American record producer, rapper, songwriter, and audio engineer.

While some may say this statement is too boastful for a rapper who just released his debut album, for Sessions it\u2019s simply speaking into existence what he knows he will achieve as an artist. This thought process is summed up in the title and main theme behind Bobby\u2019s album, LOA. The \u201claw of attraction\u2019 is the theory that anything you can see in your mind, you can hold in your hand. The instant acclaim the rapper has earned from media and fans alike is not a surprise to Sessions. He saw it all in his mind long before it manifested in real life. Born and raised entirely in Dallas, Bobby Sessions has put the city at the forefront during his rise as an artist and plans to be a catalyst for breaking not only himself but also his hometown into the mainstream after long being ignored and misrepresented. \u201cIt is important for me to achieve my success from Dallas. Most people have to leave to LA or New York to get recognized but I want to prove we have all the resources in this great city to get a quality artist to the next level.\u201d  It was in this great city that Bobby found the group of talented individuals that are currently helping him in his rise to legendary status. Creatively, the album process began when Sessions met with fellow Dallas-rapper and producer, -topic. The two came together with plans of creating an EP that would establish Bobby Sessions in the highly-bubbling Dallas hip-hop scene. However, the chemistry was so good, especially with the addition of engineer/producer Donny Domino to the equation, that Sessions and -topic created more than an album\u2019s worth of material. Highly praised Dallas producer/artist Blue The Misfit came on to add his touch to the album along with his protege and longtime friend of Sessions, Xes. Those individuals, along with musicians like Zyah and Vandell Andrew, would ultimately create the masterpiece that is LOA (Law Of Attraction). The recording process took exactly one year, and was one in which the artist experienced a series of incredible lows but ultimately extreme highs. While Bobby had dreams of making it as a rapper from a young age, they remained dreams for many years as the rapper struggled to find his way. He started at local open-mics at his college and eventually found some notoriety after becoming a member of the Dallas hip-hop collective BrainGang, with Blue The Misfit and Dr. Dre protege Justus. However, at barely 21 years of age, Bobby soon found himself broke, homeless and starving. He would sleep in his car whenever it would run out of gas, which was almost daily. Bobby regularly split $1 chicken sandwiches from McDonald's with a friend as neither could afford a sandwich of their own. \u201cI was really struggling\u201d remembers Sessions. He decided to put his dreams on hold, get a \u201creal job\u201d and try to find himself. That period lasted about 2 years until one night when arriving home from his highly mundane job at a local post office, Bobby came across a documentary film called 'The Secret'. In it, he viewed top scientists, authors and philosophers proposing the secret to leading a happy and successful life. They professed that feelings and thoughts can attract events and experiences among individuals in their physical, emotional, and professional affairs. The film struck a chord with Sessions and made him reevaluate his entire life and future. It was then he decided to return to his dreams and drop everything to become an artist with the \u201claw of attraction\u201d belief system as his guide. He quit his job with only $50 left in his bank account. He didn\u2019t know how he would pay his rent or buy food that coming month but he proceeded anyways not scared one bit at what the future would hold.  Within a month, Bobby would meet with and secure management with respected music industry executives, J Dot Jones and Vince Chapa, after playing them an early version of LOA and eventually would sign a record deal with those same individuals as they started the label, HIGH STANDARDz. What a difference a year makes! Eleven months after leaving his job broke, Bobby Sessions signed a record deal, released his debut album to critical acclaim, had a packed out album release show at a historic venue in his hometown, and continues to build his fan base not only nationally but world-wide. Sessions has proven to epitomize the \u201claw of attraction\u201d ideology. After all, if anyone can declare themselves a legend and make it their reality, it's Bobby Sessions.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2770 W Hwy 290, Dripping Springs, TX 78620", "Artist": "Rochelle & The Sidewinders ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8913847.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.193961, -98.0371637], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Jump Blues, Blues, Soul, Blues Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Dreamland Dripping Springs", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022620884-rochelle-and-the-sidewinders-at-dreamland-dripping-springs?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Award winning blues band from Austin Tx.

In reality, Texas singer/songwriter Briana Adams is a sweet-natured Southern crooner that really just wants to share her music with the world. Her songs are a honky tonk acid trip of classic dancehall and 70\u2019s outlaw country rolled into a tight-knit package, all headlined by a big Texas voice and an unmistakable style that\u2019s all her own. And if you catch a little twist of blues and rock\u2019n\u2019 roll in the vocal, that\u2019s not by accident. Growing up in a small Texas town like Winchester, that\u2019s the way country music is done! But in her heart, Briana Adams writes songs because it\u2019s her outlet, her way of sharing herself with the world. That her music happens to have commercial appeal is secondary to her inner need to write it in the first place! \u201cI write music because it can be one of the most intimate forms of communication. When I was a little girl, I told myself I was going to be a musician and write songs and I\u2019ve stuck with it. I do this because I LOVE IT!\u201d That love got her started early! Briana started playing gigs at the tender age of 13, and has done hundreds of shows since finishing high school a few years ago. She\u2019s opened for a lot of well-known Texas artists, such as Randy Rogers Band, Charlie Robison, Cory Morrow, Stoney LaRue, Jason Boland, and The Bellamy Brothers. Briana also recorded an album back in high school, 2013\u2019s \u201cBring Me Home To You.\u201d In 2016, Briana entered Edgewater Studios in Sugar Land, TX, to record her debut commercial release \u201cDive Bars & Old Guitars.\u201d Under the creative direction of producer Derek Hames (The Drugstore Gypsies, Charlie and The Regrets, National Park Radio), the project drew some of Texas\u2019 finest studio musicians, with legendary singer-songwriter-musician Mike Stinson on drums, longtime Houston studio and live stalwart Mark Riddell on bass, Robert Ellis steel guitar player Will Van Horn, Charlie and The Regrets lead guitarist John Shelton (who also recorded and mixed the EP), and well-known fiddle pro Jeff Duncan to round out the classic country sound. With a record in the can capable of launching Briana into the public consciousness, 2017 figures to be a big year in her career development as she approaches Texas radio and national press with her music for the first time. Says Briana, \u201cMy emotions are all across the board\u2026I\u2019m excited, nervous, and anxious to see how everyone responds to my music.

Francisco Javier Barraza Rodr\u00edguez, a quien todo el mundo conoce como Pancho Barraza, es originario de Juan Jos\u00e9 R\u00edos, Sinaloa. Desde muy peque\u00f1o mostr\u00f3 una gran inclinaci\u00f3n hacia la m\u00fasica, aunque al principio casi nadie cre\u00eda en \u00e9l. Fue hasta la edad de 22 a\u00f1os, mientras era maestro de m\u00fasica en la secundaria del poblado de Villa Uni\u00f3n, que se inicia de manera profesional al formar parte del grupo vers\u00e1til Karisma como vocalista y bajista. Al mismo tiempo, integra el coro de la iglesia del pueblo. Al poco tiempo, su talento y don para componer, lo llevan a la banda Los Recoditos, donde lo designan como su voz principal logrando destacar con sus propias canciones. Adem\u00e1s, se convierte en el creador del estilo rom\u00e1ntico en la m\u00fasica de banda y es as\u00ed que Recoditos empieza a sonar en las radios del Pac\u00edfico gracias a los temas de Pancho. Es tanta su inquietud por crear y la confianza que se tiene como cantante, compositor y m\u00fasico que en 1995 se separa de Los Recoditos para lanzarse como solista y forma su propia banda. La bautiza con el nombre de \u2018Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019. De ah\u00ed en adelante, los nombres de Pancho Barraza y su banda Santa Mar\u00eda empiezan a escucharse con gran insistencia por todo el Pac\u00edfico y parte de Estados Unidos con temas como \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d, \u201cIgnorarte Mis L\u00e1grimas\u201d, \u201cGabriela De Mis Amores\u201d, \u201cPasi\u00f3n De Amor\u201d y \u201cSanta Mar\u00eda Banda\u201d. Todos estos \u00e9xitos vienen incluidos en su primera producci\u00f3n como solista titulada \u201cMis Canciones De Amor\u201d. En abril del 96, lanza su segundo disco compacto titulado \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, del que destacan canciones como \u201cMi Amor Y Mi Agon\u00eda\u201d, \u201cUna Tarde Como Cualquiera\u201d, la titular \u201cCuenta Conmigo\u201d, \u201cTe Amo Y Te Lo Digo\u201d y otras. Es tanta su capacidad musical, que al a\u00f1o siguiente decide incursionar en la m\u00fasica ranchera. Forma su mariachi Santa Mar\u00eda y graba el \u00e1lbum \u201cInv\u00e9ntame Un Amor\u201d, del que se desprenden los \u00e9xitos \u201cPero La Recuerdo\u201d, \u201cSolitario Entre La Gente\u201d y \u201cCantares De Medianoche\u201d. Tanta fue la aceptaci\u00f3n que tuvo Pancho Barraza con este disco que los lugares donde se presentaba siempre estaban llenos a reventar, por lo que merecidamente se gan\u00f3 el titulo de \u201c\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u201d. En 1998, se convierte en \u201cEl Vagabundo Que Te Ama\u201d y con \u00e9ste, que fue su nuevo CD, lanza un nuevo hit a ritmo de banda: \u201cMi Enemigo El Amor\u201d, y uno m\u00e1s a ritmo de cumbia: \u201cAquella Morena\u201d. Adem\u00e1s, por primera vez graba un corrido: \u201cHistoria De Amores\u201d. En junio de 1999, vuelve a sorprender con su producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cDel Camino A La Ciudad\u201d, un disco lleno de inspiraci\u00f3n y nostalgia por los momentos dificiles que pasa cualquier ser humano. De este nuevo trabajo musical se desprenden 12 temas en los que Pancho muestra su madurez art\u00edstica y humana, ya que incursiona al mismo tiempo en g\u00e9neros como la salsa, el bolero, la balada y la cumbia. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d es el disco que el \u2018\u00eddolo de las multitudes\u2019 lanza para comenzar el a\u00f1o 2000. Por primera vez en su exitosa carrera incluye temas de otros autores. Pero les imprime su muy peculiar estilo interpretativo como es el caso de \u201cUn Indio Quiere Llorar\u201d, \u201cMi Juramento\u201d, \u201cAy Amigo\u201d, y \u201cLas Rejas No Matan\u201d, entre otros. \u201cYa Se Fue\u201d tambi\u00e9n cuenta con temas de su propia inspiraci\u00f3n, como \u201cCompa\u00f1era M\u00eda\u201d, \u201cLola La Bailera\u201d, \u201cNo Va A Matarme Tu Amor\u201d y \u201cLa Vaca Pinta\u201d. Para finales de ese mismo a\u00f1o, saca \u201cUna Noche Cualquiera\u201d una producci\u00f3n musical en la que vuelve a demostrar el porqu\u00e9 se ha convertido en uno de los \u2018cantautores\u2019 preferidos del p\u00fablico, al interprerar canciones como \u201cCon M\u00fasica Rom\u00e1ntica\u201d, \u201cEl Paso De La Iguana\u201d, \u201cH\u00e1blame Claro\u201d, \u201cDebajo De Los Laureles\u201d y la que da t\u00edtulo a este disco. Pero el talento y la creatividad de Pancho no deja de fluir y para mediados del 2000, casi a la par, lanza dos producciones. Una de estas es \u201cFormas De Vivir\u201d, con la que expone su gran versatilidad como autor, int\u00e9rprete y arreglista. Se trata de un disco completo, con acompa\u00f1amiento de su propio mariachi. Incluye temas a ritmo de cumbia como \u201cTienes Que Volver\u201d, \u201cRegresa Por Favor\u201d, \u201cMi Dama\u201d y \u201cSi Por Amor\u201d. La otra producci\u00f3n a ritmo de banda se llama \u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d. Por primera vez incluye una bachata (\u201cBurbuja De Amor\u201d) y un tema a ritmo de soca (\u201cPu tun tun\u201d), cumbias (\u201cLa Roncona\u201d, \u201cEl Muerto Se Fue De Rumba\u201d y \u201cEl Toro Baquet\u00f3n\u201d) y las rancheras que tan bien le van (\u201cArr\u00e1ncame La Vida\u201d, \u201cNo Volver\u00e9\u201d, \u201cCuando Nadie Te Quiera\u201d, \u201cA La Luz De Un Farol\u201d, \u201c\u00c1nimas Que No Amanezca\u201d y \u201cEl Dinero\u201d) y una balada (\u201cVuelve Por Favor\u201d). Por su trayectoria y sus logros, su nombre es muy importante para quienes realmente gustan de la m\u00fasica popular. Pancho Barraza comenz\u00f3 el nuevo milenio con la alegre producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza Y Mujeriego\u201d, grabada bajo el sello que lo ha visto crecer: Discos Musart/ Balboa Records. Con \u201cSinverg\u00fcenza y Mujeriego\u201d, sigui\u00f3 en los primeros sitios de popularidad, sonando fuertemente en las estaciones de radio y sorprendiendo a propios y extra\u00f1os por su mezcla de ritmos y gran calidad art\u00edstica, con \u00e9xitos tan inolvidables como \u201cTe Esperar\u00e9\u201d, que contin\u00faa en la programaci\u00f3n de muchas emisoras hasta siete a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno. As\u00ed se proyecta el talento de este artista excepcional, cuyo cat\u00e1logo crece cada d\u00eda en sus tres facetas principales: compositor, cantante y m\u00fasico. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n lo confirman sus grabaciones m\u00e1s recientes para Discos Musart/ Balboa Records: \u201cEn Vivo\u201d, donde se dio el lujo de que el p\u00fablico presente le hiciera un coro formado por miles de gargantas; y \u201cPancho Barraza Con El Alma En La Mano\u201d, un \u00e1lbum en que volvi\u00f3 al estilo ranchero que tanto le gusta, obviamente acompa\u00f1ado de mariachi. Ahora mismo, en este 2008 lo m\u00e1s reciente de su discograf\u00eda en Estados Unidos es su \u00e1lbum \u201cLa M\u00e1s Hermosa\u201d, donde acompa\u00f1ado de su propia banda presenta 12 nuevas canciones, todas escritas por el \u00e9l mismo. El primer corte promocional de este CD es la balada banda \u201cTe Voy A Olvidar\u201d. De emotiva letra y dentro de ese estilo caracter\u00edstico que lo identifica, este sencillo se perfila como otro gran \u00e9xito en su trayectoria.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "8504 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78745", "Artist": "Bridge Farmers ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8473954.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.1726942, -97.7856709], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Sludge Metal, Metal, Psychedelic Stoner Music", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Far Out Lounge & Stage", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022574893-bridge-farmers-at-the-far-out-lounge-and-stage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "8504 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78745", "Artist": "Forebode ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.1726942, -97.7856709], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Far Out Lounge & Stage", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022575516-forebode-at-the-far-out-lounge-and-stage?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1320 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "Dawn and Hawkes ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8302190.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.25353389999999, -97.7635504], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Folk", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Saxon Pub", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102685827-dawn-and-hawkes-at-saxon-pub?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cUndeniably intimate\u201d - Texas Monthly \"Impeccable vocal harmonies and instrumentation\u201d - Acoustic Guitar \"Transcendent alternative-folk - you will find yourself craving more from this amazing, dynamic duo\" - Huffington Post \u201cSongs of introspective bliss, this singer-songwriter team genuinely helps the listener feel the spirit of life\u201d - Performer Magazine \u201clovely, lilting and clearly heartfelt\u201d - Elmore Magazine \u201cOutstanding musicians individually, they are absolutely magical together.\u201d - Houston Press \u201cThe audience caved for their interplay, romance, and music.

With songs that talk about corrupted love, cocaine, prison, church, and the hard living of the common working man, it\u2019s rather surprising to learn that Meade nearly followed in his father\u2019s footsteps as a church minister. It was his brief stint as a worship leader at his father\u2019s church in Brenham, Texas that put him on the path to music. Growing up at countless rock concerts with his father cultivated his ambition to be an original artist. A former drummer, Meade played in a cover band for years while earning his business degree at Texas A&M in College Station before he peeled back another layer of himself and found a songwriter dwelling there. Now the frontman of his own band slinging guitar licks with expert precision, his music rolled out with two releases in 2014, his first EP \u201cLong Ways To Go\u201d followed by his first full-length album \u201cChief Of The Sinners.\u201d His next EP \u201cHeartbreak Coming\u201d came in 2016 with a couple of singles to announce his commencement on the Texas Music Chart.

Dawn, Black Metal band from Sweden: The history of DAWN goes back to 1990 when founder and guitarist Fredrik S\u00f6derberg left his former band, OBDURACY. (Even earlier than that, back in 1985-1986, Fredrik also was a member of CRANIUM, who later changed their name to LEGION.) Hailing from Link\u00f6ping, Sweden and therefore being close friends with death metal cult band SEANCE, it was not long before Patrik Jensen (today in THE HAUNTED and WITCHERY) recommended a new guitarist to Fredrik - Andreas Fullmestad (formerly in MORGUE). Fredrik and Andreas got together and the unit was completed by drummer Karsten Larsson and bassist Dennis Karlsson (both ex-MORTIFIED members). The final addition to this early DAWN line-up was Henke Forss (FUNERAL FEAST, IN FLAMES), providing the band with death growls from hell. For more information, see http://www.dawnband.com Dawn, Gothic Metal band from Ireland The current line-up includes: Faye Crawford (vocals), Ian Harper (guitar), Matt Woods (guitar), Robert Bamford (bass) and Niall McGuinness (drums). The band is influenced by bands such as The Gathering, Iced Earth, Paradise Lost, and Alice In Chains. For more information, see http://www.myspace.com/dawnonline Dawn (aka Tony Orlando and Dawn), US pop group Tony Orlando and Dawn was a pop music group that was very popular in the 1970s in the US and UK. They had two #1 hits with \"Knock Three Times\" and \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Ole Oak Tree,\" and a US television variety show between 1974-1976. Singer Telma Hopkins later went on to a succesful television career.

Founding members are Ilija who was at first on bass guitar before switching to vocals and Brace Zenith on lead guitar and vocals. The original lineup consisted of Urosh (vocals), Brace (guitar), Tosha (guitar), Ilija (bass) and Marko (drums). Following year, band saw numerous lineup changes. First one to leave was Urosh, and soon followed Tosha. In the spring of 2007 Jelena was recruited on bass guitar while ilija switched to vocals. Last one to join the band was Veljko, filling the place of second guitarist. The band is influenced mostly by The Sisters Of Mercy, but also has influence from Guns N' Roses, Alice in Chains, Joy Division, Mizar, Fields of the Nephilim, Diary of Dreams, Nick Cave...

The spotlight shines brighter than ever on both with Holidays & Wedding Rings, her May 2015 release. Even fans may be surprised to realize it\u2019s the first full-length solo album from one of brightest and busiest stars in her recent years amid the folk/Americana/independent country music scene. An artist of singular talent and restless creativity, she broke into the Texas country/folk scene as one of the co-lead vocalists of the Gougers before the band gradually gave way to not only Wilson's solo work (the fine EP \"Dirty Blonde Hair\" was released in 2010) but also higher-profile musical adventures with The Trishas, an all-female singer-songwriter band that has toured through some of the state and nation's best venues. Scoring one of the best albums of 2012 with \"High Wide & Handsome,\u201d the Trishas lit up the genre for a few years while always leaving Wilson room for solo gigs, guest spots on over a dozen albums by now, and song-swaps with like-minded artists all over Texas and beyond. Both deeply personal and solidly collaborative, Holidays & Wedding Rings is an evident labor of love from the sort of songwriter who can delve into the sweetness of family life without hitting sap. Someone who can dig into heartache without wallowing in it, go slow and subtle and still leave a listener rapt. Someone who can share the spotlight with top-flight musicians: veteran Texas music hands John Ross Silva, Scott Davis, Cody Foote and Reckless Kelly\u2019s David Abeyta are all in the mix here, along with alt-country star Wade Bowen on a spine-tingling duet/co-write. Wilson\u2019s home life as a wife and mom come through often in her music (and are known to many of her fans through her humorous social media profiles) but creatively, she can portray lonesome and restless with the best of them.

The silver lining, however, is that the Austin-based songwriter excels at taking bumps in the road and turning them into gold. A week before Johnson was to begin tracking his fifth solo album, Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm, he hit one such bump: His usual studio haunt, the Echo Lab\u2014where he\u2019s recorded solo work, albums by his beloved former band Centro-matic and side projects such as South San Gabriel\u2014suddenly became unavailable due to a fire. Luckily, a friend and collaborator, Britton Beisenherz (Monahans, Milton Mapes) stepped in and offered up his Austin, Texas, studio, Ramble Creek Recording. The last-minute switch was a blessing in disguise. First, the session now brought together both old friends (his Centro-matic bandmate Matt Pence, a pal of 27 years and the Echo Lab\u2019s manager) and newer friends (Beisenherz, Ricky Ray Jackson, who\u2019s worked with Phosphorescent and Steve Earle). In addition, this combination of musicians ended up unexpectedly adding more depth to the album\u2019s desolate, folk- and Americana-leaning songs. Anxious soundscapes\u2014specifically, hushed harmonies and a m\u00e9lange of drums and splintered acoustic guitars\u2014give \u201cHey-O, Hi\u201d cinematic tension. Elsewhere, mournful, coyote-howl pedal steel wafts through the country croon \u201cChildress (To Ogden)\u201d; \u201cRuby Shameless\u201d is a gentle, lullaby-like song with a chiming melodic backbone; and on the easygoing \u201cPredator,\u201d winking piano peeks out from layers of burnished guitar strums and sparking percussion. \u201cHaving Britton\u2019s personality and his fingerprints on this record definitely added more to it,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cAt first, I thought Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm was just going to be Ricky Ray and me holed up in the live room, making a really subdued, largely acoustic, pedal steel-type of record. But it wound up turning into a more involved and layered affair, and one that was even more rocking in places than it might have been had we done it at the Echo Lab.\u201d The latter development is most evident on \u201cEvery Single Day Of Late,\u201d which has a creeping sense of dread thanks to shuddering distorted guitars and rhythmically off-kilter percussion, and on the roaring, hurricane-like \u201cHeresy And Snakes.\u201d These moments might remind some people of Centro-matic, although Johnson says that band\u2019s absence is more of an influence. \u201cWhen Centro-matic was still intact, my solo records were usually really subdued,\u201d he says. \u201cI would take them in a completely different direction than the cascade of guitars and feedback that we were really into. Now that Centro-matic is not in existence anymore, there are going to be moments where I just want to turn everything up and kind of go for it.\u201d On some level, his ability to let loose stems from his chemistry with Beisenherz and Jackson, both of whom added prominent instrumental contributions to Johnson\u2019s last album, 2015\u2019s Swan City Vampires. However, this approach also reflects his comfort level with Pence. Although Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm marked their first full session together since 2012, their creative and studio relationship always tends to pick up right where it left off. That enduring connection especially helped this time around, since the crew only had five days to make Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm. Although Swan City Vampires was almost as economical\u2014it was recorded over six days\u2014that record found Johnson navigating both the loss of his mother and the 2014 breakup of Centro-matic. Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm is a different animal: The record largely revolves around fictional narratives featuring vibrant, well-defined characters dealing with \u201csituations of tension,\u201d as Johnson puts it. On \u201cEvery Single Day of Late,\u201d the protagonist finds much more than spiritual fulfillment after seeking out religious counsel, and soon becomes addicted to the taboo relationship. Milaak\u2019s titular song demonstrates the anguish which often goes hand-in-hand with human connection, while on \u201cHeresy and Snakes,\u201d misunderstood Mazie May\u2019s actions are perceived to be more nefarious than dignified. The keening \u201cFilled With a Falcon\u2019s Dream,\u201d meanwhile, namechecks the ill-intentioned trio of Lucius, Timmy and Steve. \u201cI was in a mindset of exploring risky connections between people, and their willingness to look the other way and just go through with them, for the simple need of human affection and an almost devil-may-care attitude,\u201d Johnson explains. Still, he is a benevolent songwriter. For example, the narrator of \u201cRuby Shameless\u201d looks at the song\u2019s main character, a stripper, with tenderness and humanity; he sees her as a person worth cherishing, rather than a devalued object. Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm\u2019s characters aren\u2019t \u201cmorally bankrupt,\u201d Johnson says, just dealing with a devil and an angel perched on their shoulders, whispering in their ears. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to all of these characters, even though they\u2019re flawed and maybe a little confused,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the time it\u2019s good people making bad decisions. And they may just need some affection, and then will move on. It\u2019s more coming to terms with, \u2018I\u2019m going to be alone in this world, and I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m totally okay with this solitary situation, and this empty bed.'\u201d As a solo artist, Johnson also knows all too well the balance required to navigate solitude and collaboration. However, on Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm, finding this equilibrium helps him discover nuanced and intriguing sonic directions. The album ends up a thought-provoking meditation on what it means to exist in a world that often misunderstands (or chooses to ignore) emotional complexity.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1413 Webberville Rd, Austin, TX 78721", "Artist": "Lion Heights ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11473647.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2795132, -97.68158249999999], "Date": "2021-08-06", "EventDate": "Aug. 6th, 2021", "Genre": "Dub, Dancehall, Roots Reggae", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "The Real Remedy Tour | Sahara Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102721438-lion-heights-at-the-sahara-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Austin, Texas - the \u2018Live Music Capital of the World,\u2019 is one of the most significant music destinations in the United States.

These genres\u2014ranging from 90\u2019s hip-hop to uplifting trance to classical and back again\u2014have together shaped Sara as a producer and helped to define her sound by inspiring her to always creatively push the envelope and challenge the norm (rules be damned). Aided by her diverse influences and commanded by her ever-particular ear, Sara has quickly become known for her signature dubby-yet-bouncy sound that prominently features clean, minimal tracks and always delivers a meaty low-end brimming with bass. After many years of dabbling with production and passionately sharing music with others, Sara began deejaying and started pursuing her musical career while living in New York City. After a few years spent honing her craft in New York\u2019s notoriously dog-eat-dog scene, Sara relocated to Austin, Texas and quickly made a name for herself as Austin\u2019s newest tech house heavyweight. In less than a year, Sara\u2019s become a prominent fixture within Austin\u2019s ever-growing underground house and techno scene, landing regular gigs at some of the city's most revered venues and snagging vivid support from more than a few scene veterans.

This page is for the team up between Murs and Slug.

They followed up with Felt 2: A Tribute to Lisa Bonet in 2005, and returned again with 2009\u2019s Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez. Murs and Slug\u2019s interactivity, energy and comradery are all fundamental to Felt\u2019s legacy, but the production on Felt albums has also been a major part of their success. Their first three albums were each produced by The Grouch, Ant of Atmosphere, and Aesop Rock, respectively. With such notable variance in the soundscapes of each album, the MC\u2019s were also allowed to share a unique side of their selves each release. A lot has changed since their last release over ten years ago, not only in the world but also in both their personal lives. Their careers have continued to elevate, their families have continued to grow, and their fourth album, Felt 4 U is something of a reflection of those changes. But there\u2019s familiarity too, with Ant returning to handle full production again, calling on influences from funk, soul, blues, country and hip-hop. While Felt 3 had a wintery feel, Felt 2 sounded perfect in autumn, and the first Felt captured the sounds of spring, Felt 4 U is a distinctly summery album.

He is the older brother of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Jimmie Vaughan's style was influenced by Freddie King who gave him personal advice. Also two other blues guitarists, Albert King and B. B. King, were important influences. Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson was another important early influence (Jimmie says that he and his younger brother Stevie studied Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson more than any other single guitarist). Jimmie Vaughan developed his own personal style that is easily recognized. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with singer and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Fergusson, and drummer Mike Buck. (The initial Fabulous Thunderbirds members were all proteges of Austin, Texas blues club owner, Clifford Antone.) The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. Sadly, since those early albums did not sell well, the band was left out without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the times when Jimmie's younger brother achieved popular success). The Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986 and made several albums that featured more commercial pop-music sound and production styles. Jimmie left the band in 1989 and made a \"duo album\" called Family Style with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album was released, Stevie died in a helicopter crash in Wisconsin on August 27, 1990. The album was released a few days after the tragic accident (the listed artist on the album was \"Vaughan Brothers\"). The album was light blues-influenced rock with Jimmie singing on several tracks. Vaughan released his first solo album Strange Pleasure in 1994. The album contained a song \"Six Strings Down\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself. In 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') huge debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album Blues Stop Knockin'.

He bought his first guitar, a knock-off Telecaster, when he was 15 years old and proceeded to learn everything from Garth Brooks to Nirvana, however it was the sound of the older generation that captured his imagination; George Jones, Johnny Cash, and Conway Twitty songs drifting from the radios and turntables of his grandmothers\u2019 kitchens and living rooms. This heritage is alive and well in McDonnell\u2019s earnest and straightforward songs and strong, clear baritone. Aaron formed the Pop Country band Gin Betty! shortly after moving to Seattle in 2004 recording two albums and quckly found himself with a following playing several top local venues including The Showbox, and The Triple Door. Gin Betty! was featured on a national college radio camapaign and received good responses particularly in Texas and other areas in the Southeastern United States. Personal turmoil within the band lead to it's unraveling and the formation of The Grandtours in 2009 (named after the classic George Jones tune \"The Grand Tour\"). This band explored darker territories lyrically and more complex sonic arrangements all the while staying rooted in a Classic Country Music format and flavor. Again, a local following was formed and two records were recorded, unfortunately they dissolved due to conflicts within the band in 2011. After taking some time off from playing music publicly, Aaron moved towards a solo project named Aaron McDonnell & The Gospel Plow which released an EP in January of 2013. The project was met with positive feedback from local club owners and members of the Seattle Country music scene receiving praise from veterans in the industry. With the release of his new EP \"Follow\", Aaron\u2019s emergence as a full solo artist in 2014 will be the culmination of a tough yet inspiring road which has spanded nearly a decade, including the formation and dissolution of three bands, recording of five records, and work with several top engineers/producers including; Tom Pfaffle (Nirvana, Black Crowes, Heart), Steve Aguilar (Dave Matthews Band, The Head & The Heart), and Phillip Peterson (The Posies, Portugal. The Man). With true purpose, his songs explore age-old themes of love, heartache, failure, and faith. They are classic in their influence and unpretentious in their delivery.

AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 When Jeff Plankenhorn, arguably one of the busiest and most highly regarded guitar players on the Austin music scene, tells you that he \u201chardly ever takes sideman gigs anymore,\" take it with a grain of salt. Yes, it\u2019s true he\u2019s made a concerted effort to carve out more time for his own solo career ever since issuing his breakout second studio set, 2016's SoulSlide \u2014 and he aims to find even more of that \u201cme time\u201d come the May 4, 2018 release of his new album, Sleeping Dogs on Spike Steel Records.But as far as scaling back on the whole sideman thing goes ... bear in mind that there\u2019s a big difference between \u201chardly ever\u201d and never. Namely, the former still leaves the guy just enough wiggle room to happily say \u201cyes\u201d when legends (and friends) on the level of Ray Wylie Hubbard or the Flatlanders need a can-do guitar man for a sold-out theater engagement. Or, say, when fellow A-list Austin sideman \u201cScrappy\u201d Jud Newcomb \u2014 the MVP co-producer of Sleeping Dogs \u2014 finds out he can\u2019t make it to a very special Johnny Nicholas gig in Hawaii, and asks \u201cPlank\u201d if he\u2019d be up for subbing for him. Who in their right mind is going to say no to that? Plankenhorn still selectively takes those kinds of calls not because he gets them, but because he\u2019s earned them. For the better part of the last 17 years, ever since he first moved to Texas with nothing to his name but a Geo Prism, $100, seven guitars and the generous hospitality of Ray and Judy Hubbard, the gifted multi-instrumentalist from Columbus, Ohio has busted ass to prove himself not just able and willing, but above all worthy of playing with the best of the best. And the reason so many song poets like Hubbard and Joe Ely like having Plank at their side is not just because of his prodigious chops on all things stringed (especially those played with a slide), but because of his intuitive knack for knowing when to hold back, always allowing the singer room to land a lyric and go for the proverbial kill. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the skill set I learned very early on: \u2018When in doubt, layout,\u2019\u201d Plankenhorn explains with a chuckle. \u201cThat joke about knowing when not to play? It's true.\u201d Not surprisingly, that particular skill \u2014 along with myriad other lessons in the finer points of songcraft that he\u2019s picked up from sharing stages with the masters \u2014 has come to greatly inform Plankenhorn\u2019s own music over the years. But it\u2019s never been more apparent than it is on Sleeping Dogs. Make no mistake: Plank plays a lot of guitar on the album, along with pedal steel, piano, upright bass and seemingly anything else he could lay his hands on during the sessions at the Zone recording studio just outside of Austin. But in stark contrast to SoulSlide, which by his own admission was by design a showcase for his custom-designed lap slide guitar, a patented \u201cFrankenstein\u201d beauty he calls \u201cthe Plank,\u201d Sleeping Dogs is first and foremost all about the songs. \u201cThe Plank guitar came from me wanting to mix together the two worlds of bluegrass dobro and the sacred steel tradition, and my whole last album was dedicated to that one instrument \u2014 to get it out there,\u201d he says. \u201cSoulSlide also really helped put me on the map as a solo artist, which is why I\u2019ve moved on to focusing more on doing my own thing and only doing a side gig once in a while when I really want to, with people that I really respect. But now, with Sleeping Dogs, I wanted to take a bigger look at how the whole world of music is available to me; it\u2019s not about just one guitar or sound, but rather about using all of the instruments I play and bringing all of my influences together \u2014 and about really wanting to bring my songwriting to the forefront.\u201d To that end, there are no covers on the new album, but half of the songs were born out of co-writing sessions with a handful of his longtime friends including his co-producer (and bandmate in Austin\u2019s the Resentments) Newcomb, Gabriel Rhodes, Miles Zuniga, Jon Dee Graham, and of course Hubbard \u2014 the \u201cWylie Llama\u201d of Americana/Texas music, who Plankenhorn still credits as his personal gateway to the whole scene. \u201cPretty much everyone I\u2019ve ever played with is like, one degree of separation away from Ray,\u201d he marvels with a laugh. It was also Hubbard who set Plankenhorn straight years ago when he doubted his own merits as a songwriter. \u201cI had just started out playing some of my own songs at these little acoustic gigs, but I remember telling him, \u2018Ray, I don't think I should be doing this \u2014 I\u2019m just a side guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Where\u2019s your proof? Are people coming to your shows? Are people listening to your songs? Yes? Well, there\u2019s your proof.\u2019\u201d Naturally, the song Plankenhorn and Hubbard cooked up together, a satisfyingly greasy howler called \u201cTooth and Nail,\u201d just happens to be all about the not-for-the-timid troubadour path and the discipline of songwriting, without so much as a grain of sugar to sweeten the pot. \u201cWe had already written a good portion of the song when he came back to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s like an old cat having kittens / You just crawl under the porch and do it,\u2019 which is a very Ray line,\u201d Plankenhorn says. \u201cBut what\u2019s cool is there were other lines where his wife, Judy, was like, \u2018Ray must have written that,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Ha, no, that was me!\u2019\u201d And the Hubbard-certified gnarled blues of \u201cTooth and Nail\u201d is just one of a handful of different styles Plankenhorn makes his own on Sleeping Dogs. Both the hurricane Harvey-inspired \u201cFurther to Fall\u201d (co-written with Rhodes) and the closing \u201cHeaven on Earth,\u201d Plankenhorn\u2019s awestruck tribute to his wife\u2019s transcendent love of nature, hit the same deep, soulful notes that defined his last album (with that trusty Plank guitar put to especially righteous use on the latter song). But there\u2019s also \u201cThis Guitar,\u201d a disarmingly folky, listening-room-ready paean to the workhorse acoustic Martin that\u2019s been his go-to writing guitar ever since it was anonymously gifted to him not long after he first moved to Texas. And perhaps most surprising of all (even to Plankenhorn himself), there\u2019s even a few free-spirited ventures into buoyantly catchy, unabashedly poppy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. \u201cI had already recorded a few rhythm tracks before this, but the day that Scrappy first came to the studio was also the day that Tom Petty died \u2014 and somehow, everything just kind of shifted that day,\u201d he says. \u201cNot on the entire album, but for a good portion of it, there were discussions of like, \u2018What would Mike Campbell do on this guitar part?\u2019 And out of that, some of the songs like \u2018Sleeping Dogs\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Know Anything\u2019 really changed and moved into more of a roots-rock thing. Which wasn\u2019t something I was expecting \u2014 I mean, it came out of nowhere \u2014 but I loved it.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t be the last happy surprise, either. The stately, hymn-like \u201cHoly Lightning,\u201d an arresting co-write with Newcomb and Zuniga (of Fastball fame), actually almost didn\u2019t make the final cut. \u201cI had started that one myself but just really wasn\u2019t digging it, so I took it to Miles and Scrappy in the studio, and between the three of us we completely reworked it from scratch over a couple of hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut even then I still wasn\u2019t entirely about it. But then Scrappy sent the demo to Patty Griffin, and she goes, \u2018I want to sing on this!\u2019 As soon as she said that, I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m definitely putting it on the album now!\u2019\u201d Needless to say, \u201cHoly Lightning\u201d is now one of his favorite songs on the record. Not that there\u2019s a single track that he\u2019s not proud of on Sleeping Dogs, which is a testament both to the positive experience he had recording it and the confidence he feels going forward into the next stage of his career. And should he even find himself second-guessing his conviction on that solo sojourn, well, he\u2019s already written his own anthem to sing his way through the doubt. \u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Sleeping Dogs,\u2019 I got this image of sleeping dogs lying, and how I need to let shit go,\u201d he explains. \u201cI literally took a lot of things that I\u2019m really bad at or think I\u2019m really bad at, and told myself, \u2018If I sing this for a year or two on tour, it may make me better at these things; maybe I won\u2019t take stuff personally, won\u2019t let things get me down.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Maybe somebody else will hear this song and maybe it will help them, too.\u2019 And I really like that idea: I like the idea of writing songs that have a little moral imperative to them.\u201d Some would call that a sense of purpose. Or, as Hubbard put it best to Plankenhorn way back at the start of his journey, \u201cThere\u2019s your proof.\u201d", "otherInfo": "To RSVP and for info/times, email deerfoot.treehouse@gmail.com"}, {"Address": "6700 I-35, New Braunfels, TX 78130", "Artist": "Mothership ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11295169.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.7687296, -98.0408325], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Heavy Metal, Stoner Rock, Rock And Roll, Stoner Metal, Psych Rock, Heavy Rock", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Ripplefest Texas 2021", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102614975-mothership-at-texas-ski-ranch?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Supersonic intergalactic heavy rock trio Mothership based out of Dallas, Texas give a real sense of hope that all is well in the universe, and that pure honest rock and roll has once again returned to this planet on a mission to unite true believers.

After rising through Texas' college-town and dancehall scene years ago, Green earned himself major-label support in Nashville and became the poster child of Texas music for a whole generation of fans. His list of achievements includes over 2 million albums sold, three Grammy nominations and a sold out Houston Astrodome. But after releasing six albums in eight years, sending singles like \"Wave on Wave\" and \"Let Me\" up the charts, touring with powerhouses like Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban and dealing with accusations of \"selling out,\" the meat grinder of mainstream stardom proved to be too much. He was spent. \"I felt so much pressure during the years I was with the big record labels to put out a record almost every year,\" he explains. \"There was a constant loop of having to be creative with new music, and that's just not my style. I like it to happen when it happens.\" Now, after breaking the cycle for a three-year recharge, Green is back in his comfort zone and playing by his own rules again. His is new independent album Home is his first set of originals in several years, and directly speaks to the hardcore fans that have been with him since the beginning. Featuring a mature country sound that is both modern and exposes his roots for all to see, his new tunes are full of ringing acoustic guitars, slippery steel and dobro, wailing fiddles and heartfelt, personal lyrics, making Home the return to form many fans have been waiting for. \"I'm very comfortable with this record, it came out exactly as I wanted it,\" Green says. Produced by the all-star team of Jon Randall Stewart, Justin Pollard and Gary Paczosa, the album captures some of the unbridled energy of his first three self-released projects. \"It's not too over-the-top produced, and it's not bare bones,\" says Green. \"It grooves well, you can turn it up or you can leave it down. It\u2019s a very comfortable spot.\" Of 13 new songs, Green co-wrote seven with big names like Scooter Carusoe, Liz Rose and Chris Stapleton, while six more were pulled from A-listers like Jessi Alexander, Brett and Jim Beavers, Chuck Cannon, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne. The album begins with the title track, boldly tackling the singer's contentious mainstream rise and any lingering naysayers right off the bat. Green doesn't regret taking his shot at the big time -- and says he had a lot of fun doing it -- but he does understand why some fans felt left out in the cold. \"I was blind to the game, I sang the wrong songs, and disappeared for way too long,\" he sings. \"But I've finally found my way home.\" \"That song was very, very easy to write,\" he says. \"I was writing with Patrick Davis for a couple of days here in Ft. Worth, and that song was really fast, just because I could hear those lines so easy -- 'Yeah it was fun, we were drunk as sailor's sons' -- we were heroes in our hometown, we were all those things.\" With that out of the way, Green gets down to business, laying out a series of songs aimed straight toward his core fan base in the Lone Star state, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The album's first single, \"Girls From Texas,\" is a prime example, and also features the first of Home's stellar guest appearances. A sugary, grown-up lullaby that explains why Texan girls are just a little bit better than the rest, the track spent 10 weeks on top of the Texas Music chart. Green calls recording the song face-to-face with Lyle Lovett a highlight of the whole project. \"That\u2019s a Jon Randall song,\" he explains. \"He sent it to me and I\u2019ll never forget it. I was on the plane coming home from Louisiana, and he goes 'What do you think about this?' and I literally had chills all over my body. I was like 'I\u2019ll cut that son of a gun right now!'\" \"While I Was Away,\" the project's second single, will strike a chord with anyone who leaves his or her family behind to travel for work. Written by Zane Williams, it's a tearjerker of the highest caliber -- one that even Green has trouble getting through. \"It's just such a ringing truth,\" says the father of two. \"Everyone says 'That got me. This thing made me cry. God dang, why'd you have to do that?'\" For lighter fare, Delbert McClinton and Lee Roy Parnell guest on \"May the Good Times Never End.\" With a twisting, generation-spanning storyline, it features a hot-rod beat and Parnell's burning slide guitar, as well as McClinton' rabble-rousing vocals and harmonica. \"Break It Back Down\" speaks to Green's new outlook on life and music, while \"No One Here But Us\" brings in Sarah Buxton to tell a steamy tale of desperate romance. Meanwhile, \"Right Now\" is a broken-hearted duet with Sheryl Crow that tells the unflattering-but-true story of Green dumping his now-wife on Valentine's Day. \"I was 22 years old and she was 21, I was ready to move on from Texas Tech and get to Austin and whatever was next,\" he says. \"It was the biggest mistake of my life, but at the same time it paid off, because once I realized it was a mistake, I knew our love was the real thing.\" And finally, \"Good Night In New Orleans\" ends the project on a high note, featuring a celebratory storyline and Louisiana-native Marc Broussard for added Cajun authenticity. \"I kind of have a standard rule to start and finish strong,\" Green laughs. \"The story behind it is great, and everything about that song is cool and fun and funny to me. Everybody around here loves a trip to New Orleans.\" According to Green his time off was very much needed, but even though he always intended to return, it still feels like a risk. \"There's a lot of fear, of course, and a lot of 'Is anybody interested? Has the landscape changed so much that I can't have an impact?'\" he admits. \"It's a mix of excitement and fear, but it\u2019s a welcome challenge.\" Mainstream country may have changed, but Green is back in his groove, back to loving and making music on his own terms and happier than ever. And that's a recipe for a comeback of epic proportions. \"I think I'm having the best year of my life,\" he says. \"I feel happy and I feel smarter now. I look back and I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to slow down a little bit, but the truth is life is just enjoying the passing of time, as James Taylor says. There's a lot of drama and there's mistakes and you've gotta get through all of it to get to what you're looking for.\" What he was looking for was right at Home all along.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "Austin, TX", "Artist": "Erath Old ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11604413.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.267153, -97.7430608], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "New Country, Pop Country, Red Dirt Country, Heartland Rock, Singer - Songwriter, Country", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "House Concert Tour 2021", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102792763-erath-old-at-house-concert?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Erath Old (pron. Air-Rith) it\u2019s a family name. I grew up in a small blue-collar town on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama and have been playing music for as long as I can remember. My passion for music was passed down from generation to generation, but some of my earliest influences came from my dad and my love for artists like John Cougar Mellencamp, Black Hawk and Garth Brooks. After graduating high school, I moved to Atlanta where my brother Sean and I started the power-pop band, Loverush, which was influenced by some of our favorite artists at the time: the Goo Goo Dolls, Greenday and Cheap Trick. The band ended abruptly in 2009 when our grandparents died, then our father just a few months later. Sean moved 3000 miles away and joined the military and my music career faded. I worked a landscape job and married the love of my life. My marriage would later become a catalyst for change I never knew could emerge. In 2012, my wife and I moved back home to Birmingham. I found myself in music again, learning how to make a living performing covers for the first time. Who knew playing other people\u2019s music would be a platform for finding my way again? However, the booze, the partying, the late nights, even the pride and selfishness that grew inside got the best of me and, therefore, my relationship. At the time of releasing, \u201cHey Y\u2019all\u201d in 2015, my first single and music video as a returning original artist, my wife left. I was on the road and we separated. I found myself alone in an empty apartment, falling deeper into my lifestyle and into a depression. After a four-day binge and an episode where I thought I might die, I finally asked for help. Tired of trying, tired of pushing, tired of losing it all to a dream; motivated by my own ego, I got down on my knees and gave it all to God. It started with giving up my obsession with alcohol. On my road to recovery God has renewed my mind and my spirit and He has rejuvenated my sense of self-worth. A lot has changed after three years of sobriety. Since then I have started touring, surrounded myself with family and friends and finished an album that I\u2019m proud to share with the world. My hope and prayer is that my music would inspire and encourage everyone who hears to do whatever \u201cIt\u201d is; because Sooner or Later whatever \u201cIt\u201d is, is going to \u2013 so let it.", "otherInfo": "Private House Concert"}, {"Address": "1110 E 52nd St, Austin, TX 78723", "Artist": "Ensemble ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.3099174, -97.70825830000001], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Other, Ambient, Electronic", "Time": "5:30 PM", "Venue": "Carousel Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022575457-ensemble-at-carousel-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "This can either refer to the artist named Ensemble (biography below) or a term for Broadway casts. Originally from Toulouse, France, Olivier Alary created Ensemble as his musical persona in 1998, as a platform to explore the meeting point between melodic noise and disjointed pop. After dropping out from an architecture course at college, Olivier moved to London. Initially working under the name \u2018Hearing Is Our Concern\u2019, he was actually the first person the newly-founded FatCat label ever received a demo from. We talked with him for a while about putting a release out, but Olivier wanted to work further on his tracks and in the end nothing happened. The name was changed to Ensemble and a chance meeting with Rephlex Records in 2000 resulted in the release of his first album, \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019. While not widely released, \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019 did gain a small, dedicated audience, not least of which included Bjork, who had the album on heavy rotation while working on her 2001 album \u2018Vespertine\u2019. We put Olivier in touch with her and in 2002, Ensemble\u2019s remixes of Bjork\u2019s \u2018Sun In My Mouth\u2019 and \u2018Cocoon\u2019 were released as b-sides. Their collaborative relationship eventually led to Olivier\u2019s co-writing of the song \u2018Desired Constellation\u2019 on Bjork\u2019s 2004 album \u2018Medulla\u2019, and still more remixes on the \u2018triumph of a heart\u2019 single. Around this time, Olivier continued work on a follow-up to \u2018Sketch Proposals\u2019, aiming to collide symphonic walls-of-sound with intimate folk-pop vocal pieces. Recorded over a period of 3 years, and composed mainly in Montreal, where he now resides, Olivier travelled from Canada, to Atlanta, then to a countryside farm in French Dordogne, and finally to Berlin for his recordings, with each disparate environment absorbed into the moods of each track. Expanding on his collaborative spirit, 2006\u2019s new album (\u2018Ensemble\u2019) features beautiful vocal performances by Chan Marshall (Cat Power), Lou Barlow (Dinosaur Jr.) and UK-based Mileece, as well as drums by Adam Pierce from Mice Parade and orchestral arrangements by Johannes Malfatti, performed by the Babelsberg Film Orchestra in Germany. Olivier has also composed music for several exhibitions at the V&A museum; contributed to an Audio-Video installation by Doug Aitken at the Centre Georges Pompidou; and received an honorary mention at the Ars Electronica Festival for his noise side project, Chlorgeschlecht.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1204 Chestnut St, Bastrop, TX 78602", "Artist": "Scott Collins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10396151.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.1109917, -97.3134547], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie, Folk, Country, Alternative, Southern Rock, Americana, Rock", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Lost Pines Art Center", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102794105-scott-collins-at-lost-pines-art-center?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Collins has had the privilege of gracing the most famous stages in the \u201clive music capital of the world\u201d.

Having toured the country with his former band this hardworking musician has had the privilege of sharing the stage with many famous industry professionals including Old Crow Medicine Show\u2019s Willie Watson and more recently Possessed By Paul James at his sold out show in Austin. Collins was invited to co-write in Nashville alongside publisher Debbie Throckmorton daughter of legendary country singer songwriter Sonny Throckmorton, Tammy Dodge and Grammy winner Roxie Dean. Scott Collins has been at the forefront of the local music scene including KUTX 98.9\u2019s \u2018Austin Music Minute\u2019 with Laurie Gallardo, performing at the stations notable Studio 1A and showcasing at SXSW in 2015 and again in 2017. After fronting his previous bands, Collins dove back to his roots to focus on his solo project but continues to surround himself with talented musicians once he takes to the stage. In addition to his songwriting and performing Collins founded Chicken Run Studios in 2015: a publishing company and recording studio designed by Academy Award winning engineer and producer Chet Himes. Having teamed up with Himes for his upcoming record, which is due out soon, Collins has set no boundaries for this next installment but promises it will tell his stories of life, love and the road well-traveled. 2015&2017 SXSW Showcasing Artist, 2014 ASG Award Winning Singer-Songwriter and founder of Side Show Paradise Records/Chicken Run Studios in Austin, TX.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "18300 Farm to Market Rd 1826, Driftwood, TX 78619", "Artist": "Zach Carney Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10048344.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.1316938, -98.0127716], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Soft Rock, Pop, Pop Rock, Soul, Blues, Folk", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Salt Lick BBQ", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102587445-zach-carney-music-at-salt-lick-bbq?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Singer, songwriter, musician.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2510 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "Luke Daniel ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11609774.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2374983, -97.7552305], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Colton House Hotel", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102797507-luke-daniel-at-colton-house-hotel?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Lynyrd Skynyrd meets John Mellencamp and Tom Petty", "otherInfo": "This is going to be an intimate, solo-acoustic performance.

He began performing when eight years old, and in 1963 made his recording debut with \"Lone Gone Lonesome Blues\", a staple of his father's career. Williams' early career was guided, some say outright dominated, by his mother Audrey Williams, who many claim was the driving force that led his father to musical superstardom during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Audrey, in many ways, wished for young Hank to be nothing more than a \"Hank Williams, Sr. impersonator\", sometimes going as far as to have clothes designed for him that were identical to his father's stage clothes and vocal stylings very similar to those of his father. Although Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, he became disillusioned with his role as a 'Hank Williams clone' and severed ties with his mother in order to pursue his own musical direction and tastes. After recording the soundtrack to Your Cheatin' Heart, a biography of his father, Williams, Jr. hit the charts with one of his own compositions, \"Standing in the Shadows\". The song signalled a move to rock and roll and other influences as he stepped from the shadow of his father. Also during this time, Williams had his first two No. 1 songs: \"All For the Love of Sunshine\" (1970, featured on the soundtrack to Kelly's Heroes) and \"Eleven Roses\" (1972). By the mid-1970s, Williams had finally found the musical direction that would, eventually, make him a superstar. Williams' unique blend of traditional country with southern rock and blues earned him a devoted following, although some mainstream country radio stations wouldn't touch his new songs in this blatantly untraditional sound. While recording a series of hit songs, Williams began abusing drugs, including alcohol and eventually tried to commit suicide in 1974. Moving to Alabama, Williams began playing music with Southern rock musicians Toy Caldwell, Marshall Tucker Band and Charlie Daniels, and others. His last major success was \"There's a Tear in My Beer\", a duet with his father created using electronic dubbing techniques. The song itself was written by his father, presumably, sometime between 1950 and 1953 and was recorded with Hank Williams playing just his guitar. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing and the dubbing techniques transferred the image of Hank Jr. onto the screen, so it appeared as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was an overwhelming success, both critically and commercially. It was named Video Of The Year by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country music. Hank Williams, Jr. would go on to win a Grammy award in 1990 for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. Despite his slumping album sales, Hank Williams Jr. continued to be a popular concert draw during the early 1990s and continued to record, with several of his recordings during this time still managing to achieve gold status, selling 500,000 copies. He is probably best known today as the performer of the theme song for Monday Night Football, based on \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\". The opening theme became a classic, as much a part of the show as the football itself. In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for Monday Night Football would earn him four Emmy awards.", "otherInfo": "KASE101 & 98.1 KVET Present Country Music Live at Nutty Brown Amphitheatre featuring Hank Williams Jr. on Saturday, August 7th."}, {"Address": "12225 US 290, Austin, TX 78737", "Artist": "Django Walker ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9498874.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.20858879999999, -97.97250489999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Country", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Nutty Brown Amphitheatre", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022397609-django-walker-at-nutty-brown-amphitheatre?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "From Austin, Texas but somehow a fan of Duke basketball.

The Ohio-bred and Texas-Transplanted band\u2019s first new music since 2015\u2019s Restless Ones, A Beautiful Life affirms frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom as a songwriter with the power to profoundly influence our state of mind, often by alchemizing her idealism into viscerally potent rock-and-roll songs. With its delicate coalescence of so many eclectic touchstones\u2014French pop and Celtic folk, space rock and symphonic pop, Disney scores and post-punk\u2014the result is an album that immediately lures the listener into a more receptive mindset, one that leads to deeper generosity, greater compassion, and a restored sense of possibility. Co-produced by Wennerstrom and Kevin Ratterman (Strand Of Oaks, Jim James, White Reaper), A Beautiful Life finds Wennerstrom joining forces with the likes of guitarist Lauren Gurgiolo (Okkervil River), drummer Greggory Clifford (White Denim), multi-instrumentalist Jesse Chandler (Mercury Rev, Midlake), keyboardist Bo Koster (My Morning Jacket), guitarist David Pulkingham (Patty Griffin), and longtime Heartless Bastards bassist Jesse Ebaugh. Although she debated releasing A Beautiful Life as a solo effort (as with 2018\u2019s Sweet Unknown), the Austin-based singer/songwriter ultimately conceived the album as a continuation of the journey begun on the band\u2019s breathlessly acclaimed 2005 debut Stairs and Elevators. \u201cI loved the last iteration of Heartless Bastards so much\u2014they\u2019re like family\u2014but the stars weren\u2019t aligning for us to reconvene on this record,\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cAs the record came together I realized it\u2019s always been my project, and I was determined to continue forth with that. I had so much faith in these songs and in myself, and in many ways it feels like a rebirth.\u201d Like many timeless songwriters before her, Wennerstrom channels her nuanced observation of the outside world into music that incites contemplation, catharsis, and a joyful sense of defiance. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the material goals that are prioritized by our society and the every-man-for-himself mentality of late-stage capitalism,\u201d Wennerstrom says of the album\u2019s central themes. \u201cThat way of thinking presents a false idea of what a beautiful life is, and I think it\u2019s so important that we as individuals all ask ourselves what it truly means to have a beautiful life.\u201d Throughout A Beautiful Life, Heartless Bastards guide their audience through an unhurried pondering of that very question, an exploration that begins with the soulfully expressed frustration of songs like \u201cHow Low.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to choose a simple life; so many people struggle to get ahead so they don\u2019t get left behind,\u201d says Wennerstrom, who names the Jackson 5 as a key inspiration for the track\u2019s jangly R&B grooves. \u201cI believe that a truly elevated, conscious society is one that seeks to lift each other up\u2014one where we work for the common good.\u201d On \u201cYou Never Know,\u201d the band brings in elements of Brazilian bossa nova and y\u00e9-y\u00e9, arriving at a sweetly spirited anthem against jadedness. \u201cAs we get older and experience the pain of certain plans not working out, we can build up walls to protect ourselves,\u201d Wennerstrom says. \u201cThis song is a reminder to stay open, stay present, and keep taking chances.\u201d One of the most hypnotic moments on A Beautiful Life, \u201cPhotograph\u201d unfolds as a sprawling psych-rock epic, speaking to the urgency of unconditional compassion. \u201cThere\u2019s an extreme divide that\u2019s developed in our society, but underneath it all I think we all want the same things,\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve dealt with is learning that I can\u2019t control the energy that comes at me, but I can control my reaction, and try to take a compassionate approach with everyone.\u201d And on \u201cWent Around The World,\u201d Heartless Bastards elegantly merge hip-hop beats and high-drama strings in a mesmerizing meditation on the inherent connectedness of all life. \u201cI\u2019ve toured for years and backpacked around in my off time, and through experiencing new situations I\u2019ve gotten to know parts of myself I\u2019d never known,\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cIt\u2019s reinforced for me that it doesn\u2019t matter what our race or religion is, or whether we\u2019re male or female, straight or LGBTQ\u2014we\u2019re all connected to each other, and to the planet that sustains us. It\u2019s all family.\u201d In the making of Heartless Bastards\u2019 most elaborately realized body of work to date, Wennerstrom immersed herself in a highly experimental process that sometimes involved breathing new life into song fragments she\u2019d first created decades ago. \u201cThere are little pieces of songs that I\u2019ve had in my head for 20 years, and that finally found their place on this album,\u201d she notes. As she dreamed up A Beautiful Life\u2019s finely detailed yet free-flowing sound, Wennerstrom repeatedly wandered down what she lovingly refers to as rabbit tunnels. \u201cI call them tunnels instead of rabbit holes, because they take me somewhere instead of leaving me stuck,\u201d she says. \u201cI allowed myself to really feel my way through things, trusting that I was going to get to where we needed to go. I never abandoned my vision, and because of that the album became everything I hoped it would be and then some.\u201d After recording some of the basic tracking for A Beautiful Life with Danny Reisch in Austin, Wennerstrom headed to Ratterman\u2019s Invisible Creature studio in Los Angeles, assembling such singular musicians as Andrew Bird and Persian setar virtuoso Fared Shafinury (both of whom contributed to the wildly rambling folk of \u201cThe River\u201d). \u201cI made sure to pick people whose style I knew would be a perfect fit for these songs\u2014that way I could tell them, \u2018Hey, I just want you to be you,\u2019\u201d she says. As the album took shape, Wennerstrom and her collaborators discovered an undeniable chemistry that led her to invite Clifford and guitarist Gurgiolo into the lineup for Heartless Bastards\u2019 upcoming live shows, marking the start of an exciting new era for the band. For the final track to A Beautiful Life, Heartless Bastards chose a slow-burning piece called \u201cThe Thinker,\u201d a gently galvanizing plea to \u201csee the beauty in everything.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a line in that song that sums up the whole album for me: \u2018I did it all for love and I\u2019d do it again,\u2019\u201d says Wennerstrom. \u201cFor me music is a gift\u2014I do it because I love it, and because it helps me feel more connected to the world. I think we all long for a deep connection, and I hope this record adds to the conversation on how we as a species can stop seeing ourselves as separate. I hope it helps everyone to think about how we can look out for each other, take care of each other, and lift each other up.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1315 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "MARMALAKES ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7936842.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2504975, -97.74903359999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Pop, Indie Pop, Pop Songs", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Continental Club", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022574565-marmalakes-at-continental-club?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Marmalakes is the Austin duo of Chase Weinacht (guitarist/writer) and Josh Halpern (drummer/producer), lifelong friends whose spirited intensity leaps from their recordings.

Most of my decisions to move to different cities revolved around what current band I was in. First was a small college town, Sherman TX to get a riffy-experimental- indie rock band Da Di Da off the ground. It was to little success, but thankfully brought me to Austin, TX my home for the past decade. Since then, I've played in a variety of cover bands and country acts, primarily playing bass and not loving my life too much. Post pandemic I decided to retire the bass and focus on my own music, primarily as a solo acoustic artist. My acoustic sets have shades of Conner Oberst, Pedro The Lion, Cold War Kids with the intense impassioned melodic intensity of early 2000s emo bands. My recordings have a mind of their own, typically full-band explosions of sound with clear influences of Coheed and Cambria as well as Mars Volta. In addition to my solo work, I happily play guitar for the Austin indie R&B artist Jake Lloyd.

Packed with soul and grit, his tunes are radiant with infectious guitar melodies, rollicking rhythms and nostalgic poetry. Marshall channels his fresh, frank views on love, loss, self-discovery and moving on through his gravelly voice seasoned with a drop of sweetness. A generous and engaging performer, he connects to audiences through his energetic live shows, inviting them into his expressive inner world. Marshall\u2019s solo debut, Sinners and Saints features six heartfelt songs that bloom from a place of deep honesty and real-world experience. Produced by two-time Grammy nominee Travis Wyrick (Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels, Shinedown) in Knoxville, the material on the EP flowed out of Marshall when he moved to Nashville after the brutal end of a long-time romance. The album is brimming with heartbreak and hope and shows his growth as a songwriter as well as his ability to glide through many musical styles, including modern and retro country, rock, folk and everything in between. A passion for music has coursed through Marshall\u2019s veins since his childhood split between rural West Virginia and North Carolina; he hails from three generations of accomplished musicians and singers. He came up listening to country radio hits by artists such as Restless Heart, Lonestar, George Strait and John Michael Montgomery, often while riding around in his uncle\u2019s truck. On New Year\u2019s Day when he was 16-years old, he discovered his father\u2019s old bass guitar in a closet and started learning to play it while experimenting with throwing together his own lyrics. Before long, he was seeking out concerts with friends, playing in bands and putting poetry to music, embracing that he was fated to be a country singer/songwriter. Marshall has already garnered many accomplishments as a musician. He has played bass and sung in both rock and country groups, played thousands of shows and recorded half a dozen studio albums. He has released singles that have charted in the top 10 on R&R charts. Marshall also supported country artist Jody Lee Petty on bass, touring the southeast and opening for nationally-known acts including Colt Ford, Josh Thompson, Justin Moore and David Allen Coe. Drawing inspiration from great country crooners such as Travis Meadows, Jason Isbell, Chris Stapleton and Dierks Bentley, who are capable of painting vivid pictures with words, Marshall is now boldly embarking on a solo career and preparing for the official release of Sinners and Saints.

Her entertainment career began as a child model for Houston\u2019s Neil Hamil Modeling Agency at the age of 9. By the time she was 17, she was the VJ of her very own cable television, Latin-based music video show called, Mega Mix. At 19, Amanda began working as an actor represented by Houston\u2019s premiere talent agency, Pastorini & Bosby. The majority of her jobs were voice-overs, which has proved to be quite fitting. Always encouraged by her family to perform, Amanda was never shy to try something new; songwriting and playing the guitar. Her mom, Frances, bought her a $40 guitar from a thrift store in Houston, TX. Amanda carried it around for two years until she wrote one of her most popular songs, Jose Guadalupe. A song she wrote about her father. The same song she sang to Willie Nelson, when she met him, and he asked her to sing for him. After two short college stints in California and Chicago, Amanda finally settled down in Missoula, Montana for a degree in Modern Dance performance. However, the guitar was a huge distraction and the music began to take sole focus. After one full-length record, Rainy Day, and an EP, Chase The Rain, Amanda completed her studies and graduated from The University of Montana in May of 2008. She then moved to Austin, TX in March of 2009. Amanda started a country band in Austin, recorded a live album, Country Music Turns Me On, and then decided to visit a man by the name of James White, the owner of the most well known honky tonk in Texas. Amanda\u2019s persistent nature, custom cowboy hat, and traditional country music style landed her a coveted residency at Austin\u2019s legendary honky tonk, The Broken Spoke. This new \u201cAustinite\u201d was honing her craft alongside the spirit and presence of some of Texas country music\u2019s legends. She went on to nail down a few weekly spots at other honky tonks throughout the larger area, she also landed opening act gigs for The Derailers, Todd Snider, Rick Trevino, Susan Gibson, Django Walker & Jim Lauderdale, and was picked up by a festival in France in summer 2012. But before Amanda could get to France, she managed to grab the attention of singer/songwriter and record producer, James Hyland. They recorded one song, \u201cGood For Nothing But Each Other,\u201d that Cevallos co-wrote with Austin Singer/Songwriter, Not In The Face front man, Jonathan Terrell, in December 2011. Recording with producer, James Hyland, continued in late January and went on through spring 2012. Special guests on the record include Texas music hard-hitters such as Lloyd Maines, Earle Poole Ball, Stephen Doster, Redd Volkaert, Dale Watson and a Texas Tornado by the name of Augie Meyers. Packaged with Amanda\u2019s witty lyrics and sultry old country style, you\u2019ll find a new Texas treasure titled, \u201cI\u2019ll Never Honky Tonk You.\u201d Amanda\u2019s cowboy hat is featured on the cover along with a sassy little pose that introduces you to Austin\u2019s lovable, up and coming, honky tonk girl.

We have our own state bird, state flower, and - believe it or not - our very own dinosaur, the Pleuroccelus. We also can brag about our very own State Musician. Since the 1970s. this country music icon has shared his love of everything Texas in dance halls and concert stages around the world, to the point that he was named Ambassador of Texas Music by the governor. For more than 40 years, Gary P. Nunn has sung the praises of our state, and his latest album \"Taking Texas To The Country\" paints a picture of Texas that proves that Nunn is a master craftsman. Positive responses are no accident. Nunn, a founding father of the progressive country movement, is also a forward thinker when it comes to choosing songs to record. His secret? The folks who scoot their boots across the dance floor each night. Called a pioneer by his peers, Nunn ha never been afraid of blazing new music paths, a fact noticed and admired by Red Dirt and Texas musicians.\"I think they've learned from me that they can do it themselves\" said Nunn. \" I was one of the first people to make an independetly-produced record. I started a publishing company and a production company along with a independent label. Being able to cut trugh a major mountain of red tape is now an opportunity for Nunn to get his songs to audiences quickly. Who would have ever anticipated the way our business is now, and how it's changed so much through the years, Nunn said. Today we have a new standard. The great thing about iTunes is that we don't have to have the approval of the major record labels to get radio play or even to make record sales. We can go directly to our audience. Nunn's fans understand, his music is a good fit, and they put it to good use. \"Once I had a couple coming to me and say that when their son graduated high school and was living home the first time, they sat him down and played \"Under My Hat\". It's a song sort of like a father giving his son some good advice. They told him, were gonna leave you with this before you go out into the world\". \"One of the things that really touches my heart, is to think that folks can use some of these songs to pass on to their children as good positive advice - something they can take with them for there entire life. \"That makes me real proud\"", "otherInfo": "GARY P.

They\u2019ve performed at events including Bonnaroo, High Sierra Music Festival, Pickathon, FFFFest, Bear Creek Music Festival, Utopia Festival and Pachanga Fest, while regularly touring the U.S. Brownout has also served as a highly in-demand backing band for artists including Prince, Daniel Johnston, GZA and Bernie Worrell. After a surprise national hit in 2014 with their Black Sabbath inspired 'Brownout Present Brown Sabbath' album, the band released Brownout Presents Brown Sabbath Vol. II in 2016 via Ubiquity Records.

The silver lining, however, is that the Austin-based songwriter excels at taking bumps in the road and turning them into gold. A week before Johnson was to begin tracking his fifth solo album, Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm, he hit one such bump: His usual studio haunt, the Echo Lab\u2014where he\u2019s recorded solo work, albums by his beloved former band Centro-matic and side projects such as South San Gabriel\u2014suddenly became unavailable due to a fire. Luckily, a friend and collaborator, Britton Beisenherz (Monahans, Milton Mapes) stepped in and offered up his Austin, Texas, studio, Ramble Creek Recording. The last-minute switch was a blessing in disguise. First, the session now brought together both old friends (his Centro-matic bandmate Matt Pence, a pal of 27 years and the Echo Lab\u2019s manager) and newer friends (Beisenherz, Ricky Ray Jackson, who\u2019s worked with Phosphorescent and Steve Earle). In addition, this combination of musicians ended up unexpectedly adding more depth to the album\u2019s desolate, folk- and Americana-leaning songs.

Elsewhere, mournful, coyote-howl pedal steel wafts through the country croon \u201cChildress (To Ogden)\u201d; \u201cRuby Shameless\u201d is a gentle, lullaby-like song with a chiming melodic backbone; and on the easygoing \u201cPredator,\u201d winking piano peeks out from layers of burnished guitar strums and sparking percussion. \u201cHaving Britton\u2019s personality and his fingerprints on this record definitely added more to it,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cAt first, I thought Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm was just going to be Ricky Ray and me holed up in the live room, making a really subdued, largely acoustic, pedal steel-type of record. But it wound up turning into a more involved and layered affair, and one that was even more rocking in places than it might have been had we done it at the Echo Lab.\u201d The latter development is most evident on \u201cEvery Single Day Of Late,\u201d which has a creeping sense of dread thanks to shuddering distorted guitars and rhythmically off-kilter percussion, and on the roaring, hurricane-like \u201cHeresy And Snakes.\u201d These moments might remind some people of Centro-matic, although Johnson says that band\u2019s absence is more of an influence. \u201cWhen Centro-matic was still intact, my solo records were usually really subdued,\u201d he says. \u201cI would take them in a completely different direction than the cascade of guitars and feedback that we were really into. Now that Centro-matic is not in existence anymore, there are going to be moments where I just want to turn everything up and kind of go for it.\u201d On some level, his ability to let loose stems from his chemistry with Beisenherz and Jackson, both of whom added prominent instrumental contributions to Johnson\u2019s last album, 2015\u2019s Swan City Vampires. However, this approach also reflects his comfort level with Pence. Although Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm marked their first full session together since 2012, their creative and studio relationship always tends to pick up right where it left off. That enduring connection especially helped this time around, since the crew only had five days to make Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm. Although Swan City Vampires was almost as economical\u2014it was recorded over six days\u2014that record found Johnson navigating both the loss of his mother and the 2014 breakup of Centro-matic. Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm is a different animal: The record largely revolves around fictional narratives featuring vibrant, well-defined characters dealing with \u201csituations of tension,\u201d as Johnson puts it. On \u201cEvery Single Day of Late,\u201d the protagonist finds much more than spiritual fulfillment after seeking out religious counsel, and soon becomes addicted to the taboo relationship. Milaak\u2019s titular song demonstrates the anguish which often goes hand-in-hand with human connection, while on \u201cHeresy and Snakes,\u201d misunderstood Mazie May\u2019s actions are perceived to be more nefarious than dignified. The keening \u201cFilled With a Falcon\u2019s Dream,\u201d meanwhile, namechecks the ill-intentioned trio of Lucius, Timmy and Steve. \u201cI was in a mindset of exploring risky connections between people, and their willingness to look the other way and just go through with them, for the simple need of human affection and an almost devil-may-care attitude,\u201d Johnson explains. Still, he is a benevolent songwriter. For example, the narrator of \u201cRuby Shameless\u201d looks at the song\u2019s main character, a stripper, with tenderness and humanity; he sees her as a person worth cherishing, rather than a devalued object. Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm\u2019s characters aren\u2019t \u201cmorally bankrupt,\u201d Johnson says, just dealing with a devil and an angel perched on their shoulders, whispering in their ears. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to all of these characters, even though they\u2019re flawed and maybe a little confused,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the time it\u2019s good people making bad decisions. And they may just need some affection, and then will move on. It\u2019s more coming to terms with, \u2018I\u2019m going to be alone in this world, and I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m totally okay with this solitary situation, and this empty bed.'\u201d As a solo artist, Johnson also knows all too well the balance required to navigate solitude and collaboration. However, on Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm, finding this equilibrium helps him discover nuanced and intriguing sonic directions. The album ends up a thought-provoking meditation on what it means to exist in a world that often misunderstands (or chooses to ignore) emotional complexity.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2008 Congress Ave S, Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "Kathy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8488720.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.243677, -97.75225929999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "C-boy's Heart & Soul", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022574665-kathy-at-c-boy's-heart-and-soul?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1320 S Lamar Blvd, , Austin, TX 78704", "Artist": "Van Wilks ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.25353389999999, -97.7635504], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "The Saxon Pub", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022461805-van-wilks-at-the-saxon-pub?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Van Wilks"}, {"Address": "310 W Willie Nelson Blvd, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Jason Isbell ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10170712.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2652496, -97.7470749], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1020429887-jason-isbell-at-austin-city-limits-live-at-the-moody-theater?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Pre-Order The Nashville Sound.

Leaving behind a 15-year long career of production experience in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became fascinated with the sounds of Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence with the soul of house music. Then came \u2018Okay,\u2019 the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014. It claimed the #1 position on Beatport\u2019s House chart for 82 days, remained in the House Chart\u2019s Top 10 for over 180 days, was put on rotation by radio tastemakers like Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard and received support from the likes of Claude VonStroke, Eats Everything, Green Velvet and nearly every major DJ under the sun. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed \u2018Okay\u2019 a \u201cglobal club sensation in waiting,\u201d a prophetic description that couldn\u2019t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in DJ sets even to this day. Shiba San\u2019s debut release on DFTD, \u2018All I Need\u2019 with fellow Frenchman Tim Baresko, dominated Beatport\u2019s overall chart at the #1 position for over a month. The song landed on multiple \u2018Best of 2018\u2019 lists, with notable support from influential tastemakers, such as Pete Tong, Calvin Harris, Jack Back (David Guetta), among others. With over 15 #1 Beatport tracks, there\u2019s a reason why DJ Mag France named Shiba San \u2018Best of House.\u2019 His critically acclaimed record label, Basement Leak, is home to some of the finest tech house tracks on the scene right now. Since the label\u2019s inception in 2017, Basement Leak has taken over stages at renowned festivals and curated its own events at Art Basel, Miami Music Week, FriendShip, Groove Cruise, Sound Nightclub in Los Angeles and Faust in Paris.

The San Antonio-based group packed the small bars and local hangouts and quickly became the Alamo City\u2019s most-loved band, earning them a spot on the cover of Billboard Magazine in 1996. It was the beginning of a twenty year journey for Geil and the 4-piece ensemble. Releasing \u201cTwo Tons Of Steel\u201d in 1994 and \u201cCrazy For My Baby\u201d in 1995 on Blue Fire Records, a sponsorship deal with Lone Star Beer quickly followed. Dead Crickets, renamed Two Tons of Steel in 1996 began traveling outside of Texas, including stops at the Grand Ole\u2019 Opry in Nashville, Tenn., the National Theater in Havana, Cuba, and European tours, to greet fans who had embraced their Texas-born sound. In 1996 they released \u201cOh No!\u201d on their independent label, \u201cBig Bellied Records.\u201d They followed up the passion project with a live recording at the legendary Gruene Hall in Gruene, Texas, taped during a Two Ton Tuesday Show 1998. In 2017, the band marks 22 years of legendary \u201cTwo Ton Tuesday Live from Gruene Hall.\u201d The summer-long event has drawn over 200,00 fans to the iconic show. The popular concert series was captured in \u201cTwo Ton Tuesday Live,\u201d a DVD-CD combo released on Palo Duro Records in 2006. Also that year, the band\u2019s first national release, \u201cVegas,\u201d produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Lloyd Maines on the Palo Duro label, took them to No. 7 on the Americana Music Charts and was one of the top 20 releases of 2006. Two Tons released \u201cNot That Lucky\u201d in 2009. The album peaked at No. 4 on the Americana Music Charts and has made Two Tons of Steel a band to watch in 2017. Along the way, the band has collected a number of awards. To date, Two Tons has cleaned up at home, winning \"Band of the Year\" on 12 separate occasions and \"Album of the Year\" for its self-titled debut. Two Tons has also been named \"Best Country Band\" by the San Antonio Current ten times. Geil also has nabbed 'Best Male Vocal' honors four times. Two Tons of Steel\u2019s reach extends beyond their live gigs. In 2003, the band was filmed during a \u201cTwo Ton Tuesday\u201d gig for the IMAX film, \"Texas: The Big Picture,\" which can be seen daily at the IMAX Theatre in the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin and has been seen as far away as Japan.

In reality, Texas singer/songwriter Briana Adams is a sweet-natured Southern crooner that really just wants to share her music with the world. Her songs are a honky tonk acid trip of classic dancehall and 70\u2019s outlaw country rolled into a tight-knit package, all headlined by a big Texas voice and an unmistakable style that\u2019s all her own. And if you catch a little twist of blues and rock\u2019n\u2019 roll in the vocal, that\u2019s not by accident. Growing up in a small Texas town like Winchester, that\u2019s the way country music is done! But in her heart, Briana Adams writes songs because it\u2019s her outlet, her way of sharing herself with the world. That her music happens to have commercial appeal is secondary to her inner need to write it in the first place! \u201cI write music because it can be one of the most intimate forms of communication. When I was a little girl, I told myself I was going to be a musician and write songs and I\u2019ve stuck with it. I do this because I LOVE IT!\u201d That love got her started early! Briana started playing gigs at the tender age of 13, and has done hundreds of shows since finishing high school a few years ago. She\u2019s opened for a lot of well-known Texas artists, such as Randy Rogers Band, Charlie Robison, Cory Morrow, Stoney LaRue, Jason Boland, and The Bellamy Brothers. Briana also recorded an album back in high school, 2013\u2019s \u201cBring Me Home To You.\u201d In 2016, Briana entered Edgewater Studios in Sugar Land, TX, to record her debut commercial release \u201cDive Bars & Old Guitars.\u201d Under the creative direction of producer Derek Hames (The Drugstore Gypsies, Charlie and The Regrets, National Park Radio), the project drew some of Texas\u2019 finest studio musicians, with legendary singer-songwriter-musician Mike Stinson on drums, longtime Houston studio and live stalwart Mark Riddell on bass, Robert Ellis steel guitar player Will Van Horn, Charlie and The Regrets lead guitarist John Shelton (who also recorded and mixed the EP), and well-known fiddle pro Jeff Duncan to round out the classic country sound. With a record in the can capable of launching Briana into the public consciousness, 2017 figures to be a big year in her career development as she approaches Texas radio and national press with her music for the first time. Says Briana, \u201cMy emotions are all across the board\u2026I\u2019m excited, nervous, and anxious to see how everyone responds to my music. I\u2019m a little scared because it\u2019s my first major release, but for the most part I\u2019m extremely excited. I believe the Good Lord has put me on the right path, and I\u2019m just going to hang on, enjoy the ride, and see where it takes me.\u201d Her superlative voice, vintage style, and quiet confidence even in the face of doubt will take her a long way.

From there both stories, of nation and artist, sweep westward, drawing from new surroundings, absorbing what each station on their way has to offer. America\u2019s journey is still underway. But in a sense Chuck Shaw has found what he was looking for: a place where he can put down roots and nurture his unique artistry. For Shaw, that place is, as someone once crooned, deep in the heart of Texas. He\u2019s been there for just a few years but that\u2019s time enough for him to know he has come home. With his love for old-school country music, his ability to write songs nourished by that tradition and sing them with rare expression, this is where he has always belonged. \u201cEven when I was in high school back in New Jersey, I knew I was probably going to end up in Texas,\u201d he reflects. \u201cAnd later, when I was in Colorado and Wyoming, friends kept telling me, \u2018You need to move to Texas. You sound like you belong there. That\u2019s where the real stuff is.\u2019\u201d The \u201creal stuff\u201d is country music that\u2019s about substance, not style. All you need to do is listen to his self-titled debut album to know it\u2019s true. It\u2019s in the raunch, grit and swagger of \u201cDirty Woman Creek,\u201d the neon glow and greasy groove of \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time,\u201d the morning-after cobwebs and cold daylight that color \u201cHope I Can Get Through Today\u201d We could go through all 12 tracks, up to the handclaps and gospel affirmation of \u201cRise Up,\u201d each one written by Shaw except for his striking rendition of \u201cLong Black Veil\u201d and little-known gem \u201cAin\u2019t No Bad Time.\u201d Like so many good things in life, it goes by fast and easy and then lingers until it\u2019s cued up again. This is Lone Star country \u2014 but the deeper you listen, the more hints you hear of the path he took to reach that destination. In his first single, \u201cBurn That Oil,\u201d the harmonica riff and nostalgic reminiscence might bring Springsteen to mind. Shaw wouldn\u2019t deny it, being born and raised through high school in New Jersey. But even in his formative years, with his friends immersed mainly in rap, Shaw felt the call of country, first from groups like The Eagles and Creedence Clearwater Revival. \u201cA lot of the rock I grew up with had country roots,\u201d he says. \u201cThen one day in high school, after I\u2019d gotten my heart broken, I bought the John Fogerty album Blue Ridge Rangers, where he covered a bunch of country songs including \u2018She Thinks I Still Care.\u2019 That song really spoke to me. And through the album as a whole I discovered George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and all the others who would influence me so much.\u201d After getting his first electric guitar at age 13, Shaw formed a band \u2014 probably the only one in his part of the Garden State that featured a country fiddle player. He started writing songs too. The more he crafted his style, the more determined he was to seek inspiration out west, the cradle of the music he had come to love. So after graduation, he headed out to the Rocky Mountains to study creative writing at Colorado College. Equally important, he honed his vocal and instrumental chops with the school\u2019s celebrated Bluegrass Ensemble, an education that included three appearances at the Durango Bluegrass Meltdown. Eventually, after working for a couple of summers on a ranch in Wyoming and then spending a year in Arizona that included four months on the road with the country/rock band Mostly Water, Shaw made his pilgrimage to Nashville. With money he\u2019d saved from Mostly Water, he recorded an EP and, in the summer of 2015, started playing in Music City\u2019s fabled honky-tonks. Nights of grinding out country hits in touristy dives sharpened his performance skills. It also cued him when it was time to get out of town. \u201cIt was exciting at first,\u201d Shaw remembers. \u201cIt taught me how to interact with the crowd, how to get people excited. And there were some great singers and players down there. But I started hating it after a while because I just couldn\u2019t stand to play mainstream pop/country day and night, over and over again. Even songs that I loved got beaten to death. There was so little originality.\u201d And so Shaw embarked on the last stage of his Odyssey, this time to San Marcos late in 2016. Since then, he went from finding a place to live in a town filled with strangers to building up friends and followers through open-mike nights and paying gigs throughout Central Texas. \u201cI fought hard to play anywhere I could,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if meant annoying the heck out of club owners, I did what I had to do to get my name out there.\u201d Persistence has paid off and put this young man square in the spotlight as one of traditional country\u2019s most promising new talents. Chuck Shaw makes that more than clear \u2014 and for those who somehow still don\u2019t get the message, he\u2019s happy to lay it all out in plain Texan: \u201cThe music I love is real,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s pure. It\u2019s a great American art form. I love how it sounds \u2014 the fiddle, the pedal steel \u2014 and how it feels. They know that down where I live, but when I play somewhere else, where people only know that mainstream pop country, I explain to them: This is how we do it in Texas. \u201cThis is country music.\u201d -30-", "otherInfo": "Full band!"}, {"Address": "2467 TX-304, Smithville, TX 78957", "Artist": "Hayden Haddock Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10024556.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.9638031, -97.29768279999999], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Red Dirt, Country", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Hayden Haddock - Snake Prairie Events \\ Smithville, TX", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102747043-hayden-haddock-music-at-snake-prairie-rural-events-and-entertainment-llc?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Singer/Songwriter - Country Music College Station, TX", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "708 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78701", "Artist": "Legado 7 ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.2662562, -97.7355382], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Mala Vida", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022151610-legado-7-at-mala-vida?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2015 E Riverside Dr Bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741", "Artist": "Brodie Lane ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9701106.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2400045, -97.7276248], "Date": "2021-08-07", "EventDate": "Aug. 7th, 2021", "Genre": "Americana, Country, Pop, Roots Rock", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Come and Take It Live", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102801447-brodie-lane-at-come-and-take-it-live?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "BRODIE LANE started as \u2018just a reference title of a folder of Roots-rock & pop/Americana compositions made w/ some ol\u2019 drinkin buds\u2019 piling up in one of 3x AMA Producer of the Year, AJ Vallejo\u2019s studio hard drive. \u201cA couple years later we were sitting on an album worth of some really decent tracks haha..\u201d chuckles AJ, \u201c..We thought, hey, we all like each other enough to play these tough grown-up love songs on the road together.\u201d And just like that BRODIE LANE & Pop Americana was born.

He spent his early years moving from one small town to the next and picked up the guitar at age16, in an effort to mend his first broken heart. Graham finished high school in Wichita Falls, TX and attended Hendrix College, Arkansas, in pursuit of a fine arts and music degree. He decided to take a needed break before graduation and traveled to the Greek islands of Mykonos and Paros located in the Agean Sea where he worked at a diesel jet-engine power plant, mingled among the locals and played his music in the streets. After gaining the life experiences desired, he completed his degree in 2002. He then set out upon another quest and traveled half way around the world to the Micronesian island of Pohnpel, where he volunteered as an English teacher in the local Jesuit school. While overseas, his older brother and best friend Aaron Robert Wilkinson passed away in New York City. By far, his brother\u2019s death was the most difficult thing his family and he have faced. His brothers influence is easily identified in many of Graham\u2019 songs .You see, Aaron was singing and writing in lower east side coffee shops, on the cusp of the Anti-folk scene. Hanging out with the soon to be recognized Regina Spektor, Kimya Dawson, Adam Green from the Moldy Peaches and the guys from The Strokes. The Strokes went on to dedicate their second album \u201cRoom on Fire\u201d to Aaron and all of these musicians continue to make appearances at the Annual Memorial concert held in NYC every July. Aaron\u2019s death lead Graham back to the \u201cstates\u201d. \u201cHad Aaron not passed away, I may never have returned from my volunteer work on Pohnpel\u201d, he stated. It was truly a crossroad in his journey, as he immediately knew upon returning to Texas that he had to move to Austin to make \u201chis music\u201d. The first few years in Austin allowed Graham the opportunities to broaden his musical horizons from leading a punk rock outfit to collaborating on an old-time/bluegrass quintet. Unable to be pinned to one genre, Graham began developing a lineup of interchangeable artists known as the Underground Township. Graham has now found the sound he has been searching for with the current Underground Township lineup and it\u2019s reflective on his new album \u201cYEARBOOK\u201d. It\u2019s been well received by leading Austin radio stations KUT and KGSR and 12 other stations through out the country. \u201cYEARBOOK\u201d features such artists as Alejandro Escovedo (No Depression magazine Artist of the Decade), Hayes Carll (Top played Americana Record of 2009), and Lloyd Maines (Multi-Grammy winning producer/and father of Natalie Maines). The depth of his influences and breadth of his worldly experiences, are unmistakable in this diverse collection of heart thumping tunes. From ska to folk, honky-tonk to rock, his lyrics tackle such lofty and often neglected topics as social responsibility and justice, political corruption and greed while consoling the audience with pithy love songs and pure \u2018feel good\u2019 rhythms and melodies. Though seen as the debut of this young songwriter one must know this is not all we will hear and see from Graham, but rather an incredible step towards a successful musical journey.", "otherInfo": "Join G his band at the Far Out Lounge for a Sunday brunch on Sunday August 8th from 1-3pm."}, {"Address": "3700 Bell Springs Rd, Dripping Springs, TX 78620", "Artist": "Havins ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9558512.jpeg", "Coordinates": [30.2389708, -98.12586879999999], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "2:00 PM", "Venue": "Havins at Bell Springs Winery", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102708111-havins-at-bell-springs-winery?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Havins is a singer-songwriter from Austin, TX who lives in Boston, MA.

Jake spent his grade school and high school years listening to Garth Brooks and dreaming of becoming a football star for the Redbirds. He then became just that, as an All-State linebacker and the Redbirds leading rusher. He attended Eastern Illinois University, where he continued his football success as a linebacker, starting his career as a walk-on and ending it on a full-ride scholarship. At EIU, he earned a high school teaching degree and every now and then entertained his friends around a bonfire picking and singing some of his favorite \u201cRed Dirt\u201d Texas country songs. Inspired by Pat Green, Jake picked up a pen and started putting some thoughts to music. Those first Jake Maurer songs are still some of his friends\u2019 favorites. After college, Jake began coaching and teaching but found himself looking for ways to fill the void left after a decade of playing football. He and a fellow coach discovered their common interest in playing guitar. Jake and \u201cSledger\u201d mixed their love of country and rock and started playing in their living rooms, at open mic nights, and then picked up some band members to create \u201cIrons in the Fire.\u201d Within those two years playing in bars and dives every weekend, Jake realized he enjoyed his night job far more than his day one. He and his fianc\u00e9 walked into the principal\u2019s office and let him know they were leaving for Nashville the moment school ended. The response, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d No joke, school ends, celebrate nuptials and head south to find out what Nashville is all about. Days later Jake landed a gig at Tootsie\u2019s Orchid Lounge on Broadway in downtown Nashville and has been playing there ever since. Jake is not only a talented song-writer, but is also a gifted singer, plays acoustic guitar and his best quality just might be his natural ability to entertain. He loves to talk to the crowd and make them laugh by saying just about anything that might pop into his mind; the more ridiculous, the better. People walk into Tootsie\u2019s for a beer and before they know it they have spent four hours with the Jake Maurer Band. Jake drove into Nashville, knowing that he loved playing music but was not exactly sure what he was looking for. Years into this business and he has realized he has what he wants\u2026. a fun place to sing and entertain in Tootsie\u2019s Orchid Lounge and the ability to play the songs he wants, the songs he writes, at the places he loves. He gets to play at Tootsie\u2019s, travel the country playing huge and small venues alike and all of that still allows him to spend time at home, tending to his 2nd love\u2014cattle, chickens and 5 kids. He loves every day of work, whether at Tootsie\u2019s or entertaining at any event across North America. The Jake Maurer Band expands their tour every year, continuing multiple annual shows\u2014such as headlining the \u201cHawgarama\u201d festival in Regina, Saskatchewan for a 7th consecutive year. They also continued their appearance at the\u201cBlack Tie Tail Gate\u201d for the third year running, which is sponsored through the Windsor Spitfires and is the biggest fundraiser of the the year for We Care for Kids in Ontario. They also add new shows every year. They recently took stage in Kalispell, Montana as the entertainment, aside Jack Hannah of the Outdoor Channel, for an Intermountain charity.

The visual power of ten people doing the same thing at the same time is immense, and everybody in this band is an incredible dancer and performer.\" Whereas the songs on 'Fame Sessions' were peppered with special guest performances by members of the legendary Swampers rhythm section\u2014including the likes of Spooner Oldham and David Hood\u2014as well as vocal contributions from the Shoal Sisters, everything about the 'Royal Sessions' EP showcases The Nightowls coming into their own as a band. \"In the past, it was mainly me writing, arranging, and collaborating with a small handful of band members,\" says Harkrider, \"but this one was much more of a full band effort. I\u2019d take a song idea to the rhythm section to flesh it out, and then take that to the horn section for their parts, and then from there we'd work out the final arrangement as a full band to make sure everything worked together and everybody got to express themselves and be creative and have their stamp on it.\" The result is an energetic blend of classic soul and modern pop, as the band transcends the \"retro\" tag that described their early releases in favor of a more unique sound reflective of all ten personalities, with influences running the gamut from James Brown to Michael Jackson. Bright, bold horns dance and leap over a funky rhythm section, while Harkrider's soulful voice shimmers out alongside gorgeous female harmonies. The infectious vitality of the music is due in no small part to the fact that the band recorded the entire EP live over two days at the famed Royal Studios in Memphis, TN. \"We're big Al Green fans,\" guitarist Amos Traystman says of the decision to record at Royal, where Green laid down many of his biggest hits. \"We had a string of Tennessee shows while on tour last fall, and we decided to check in with Boo Mitchell over at Royal Studios to see if we could record a few songs while we were in Memphis. We were writing stuff on the road and scrambling a bit to get the material together last minute, but the sessions were great. It's always fun for us to be in a room with so much history.\" The EP kicks off with \"Right Around The Corner,\" which encompasses so many of the band's strengths, from punchy horns to call-and-response vocals steeped in the kind of timeless soul music the band grew up on. \"I felt lyrically that we needed to have a song that was true to our experience as a band over the last six months,\" says Harkrider,\" so this one tells the story of us being on the road and working and missing our family and friends, but it's also a reminder that even though we\u2019re out there doing our thing, we\u2019re always going to be close to home and there when they need us. There\u2019s a gang vocal at the end that we all did as a band in the studio, and it was one of the most rewarding recording experiences ever because we were all in there together as a family.\" \"Can't Hold Me Down\" is a frequent Nightowls show-opener that's rooted in the kind of unshakable optimism and positivity that make the band's live performances such feel-good, uplifting, and memorable events, while on \"Clean It Up,\" they offer a clear glimpse of their transformation and where they may be headed with the next full-length, as 'Thriller'-era horns mesh with gritty soul vocals and spacey electric guitars. Elsewhere, \"Gotta Keep Moving\" calls to mind the brass-fueled hits of Chicago, and \"Don\u2019t Wanna Leave You Lonely\" pays subtle homage to Green. \"That one is a little outside what we'd normally do progression and arrangement-wise, says bassist Rob Alton, \"but it ends up working so well because it features everyone really brilliantly. There\u2019s several guitar tracks that, without each other, wouldn't work, but when you put them together, it creates a really cool texture that Al Green has on a lot of his records.\" \"There's a great horn interlude and background harmonies,\" adds trumpeter Michael Rey, \"but above all it's that drum sound and groove that makes this work. It\u2019s the simplest and hardest thing to do, just to play open and to play straight up and down, but our drummer, Ben Petree, does it fabulously.\" In the end, as much as for any musical evolution, the 'Royal Sessions' may one day be best remembered in The NIghtowls' catalog as the recording that marked their transition from a band into something more, something far deeper. In that sense, they didn\u2019t' just find their sound while recording this EP, they also found themselves: soul brothers and sisters in a true royal family.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1281 Gruene Rd, New Braunfels, TX 78130", "Artist": "Grouchy like Riley ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8597952.jpeg", "Coordinates": [29.7383197, -98.1044616], "Date": "2021-08-08", "EventDate": "Aug. 8th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk, Americana", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Gruene Hall", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022621043-grouchy-like-riley-at-gruene-hall?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "See above listed web sites.

Touring steadily, writing constantly, and singing her heart out onstage and on record, she\u2019s become a welcome discovery for listeners who\u2019ve found their way to her sweet and soulful take on classic country music. Her first full-length record, Triggering A Flood, was released in May 2013 to regional acclaim and her 2015 follow-up So This Is Life is poised to make an even larger splash as her audience has expanded to corners all around the world. Her expansive voice, laced with deep Texas twang but bearing the influence of favorite songwriters from the \u201870s folk-rock scene all the way through the present day, gives new life to old themes of finding love and freedom where you can and trying to hold yourself together when it slips away. Since the release of Triggering A Flood, her music has taken her on tours through Europe and Canada as well as across the United States; she\u2019s also toured and recorded with Jason Eady, a fellow keeper of the real-country-music flame that Patton wed in 2014. She\u2019s also shared the stage with leading lights of the country-folk genre including Walt Wilkins, Bruce Robison, Jamie Lin Wilson, and Drew Kennedy, the latter of whom served as producer on So This Is Life. Indebted to the subtle depths of her favorite late-\u201870s Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard records, it\u2019s a perfect frame for Patton\u2019s lyrical snapshots of heartache, longing, and love. \"I suppose realism is what I look for in new music.

Im Sommer 2017 verschanzte sich die Band in den Bergen und schwor sich, erst wieder ins allt\u00e4gliche Leben zur\u00fcckzukehren, wenn ihre Musik sich in ein Konglomerat des Besten, was jedes Bandmitglied zu geben hatte, transformiert h\u00e4tte.

During a performance, they will rattle you to the core with a heartbreaking ballad and then unleash a New Orleans inspired boogie that leaves the listener longing for the days when juke joints ruled the American landscape. Their music is somehow familiar, yet can leave you feeling like an outsider who has just witnessed something very real, painfully beautiful, and ultimately redeeming. Regardless of how their music grabs you, a Choctaw Wildfire performance might be the most genuine thing you've heard in a very long time. Fronted by pianist and songwriter Charlie Pierce, whose deep riveting voice and dark narrative songs have drawn comparisons to Johnny Cash, Nick Cave, and Tom Waits and a piano pedigree that includes study with internationally renowned Chicago legends Chris Foreman of the Deep Blue Organ Trio (a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jimmy Smith) and Erwin Helfer (who played with Muddy Waters and performed regularly at Preservation Hall), Choctaw Wildfire represents the culmination of a lifetime of Charlie\u2019s dedication to his musical craft. Manning drums and percussion for Choctaw Wildfire is Lee Potter, a 20 year veteran of the Austin music scene and longtime spark plug for acts like Jeff Hughes, Cornell Hurd, and Bracken Hale. He has toured with Rosie Flores and Dale Watson, appeared on Austin City Limits (with Watson), and can be found on recordings by the Derailers, Chaparral, Charlie Burton, and the LaSalles among others. Charlie Pierce and Choctaw Wildfire is an intense, driving honky-tonk piano trio that performs a timeless array of original American music.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1500 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78702", "Artist": "Ingebrigt Haker Flaten ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [30.2634308, -97.72726399999999], "Date": "2021-08-09", "EventDate": "Aug. 9th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Volstead Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022648626-ingebrigt-haker-flaten-at-volstead-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1302 S.

This is the name of Nemegata\u2019s debut LP, recorded by Beto Martinez (Prince / Brownout / Grupo Fantasma), and by longtime collaborator and colleague Juan Alvarez \"El Mono\", out on Chicago\u2019s indie label Sonorama Discos. The album puts into context a far-reaching exploration into the many channels of influence this band possesses. Synthesizing tradition with elements of South American and African psychedelia through imaginary landscapes inviting the listener into what is without a doubt a sonic trip towards resignified roots and ancestry. Senior Editor at Rolling Stone Magazine David Fricke gave Hycha Wy a 4-star review on UK\u2019s MOJO Magazine calling it \u201c Rhythmic ambition and spiritual verve, this power-trance trio is a genuine pan-American thrill, fusing shamanistic pulse, cumbia-via-New Order, garage blues minimalism, and Bay Area- \u201860s psychedelia as if the were all native tongues.\u201d To cope with being an immigrant preteen growing up in the late 90\u2019s USA, Victor-Andres Cruz \"El Gu\u00e1mbito\" obsessed over Colombian traditional music and instruments as a defense mechanism. He found refuge and a profound sense of identity rooted in these sounds. Raised as an amalgamation between the Colombian Andean countryside, Florida, New England, and New York City, Victor created a voice and a place where all worlds converge. In 2018 Casa del Indio Discos recorded and released Nemegata\u2019s first 7\u201d single using a 4-track cassette recorder. The tracks were produced in collaboration by \"Ni\u00f1o Lento\" and played on drums by \"Dilemastronauta\", two of the masterminds behind the emblematic Combo Chimbita. Among Austin Chronicle\u2019s top 10 new local acts of 2019 along with Black Pumas, and Austin\u2019s top 100 albums of 2020, this band has risen from the inseparable strong bond between C\u00e9sar Valencia \"I Nova\"(Bass), Fabian Rinc\u00f3n (Drums) and Victor.
