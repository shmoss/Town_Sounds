Brooks Robertson just doesn't need much more than two thumbs, eight fingers and six strings on a wooden box to carry his listeners away. Hailed by prominent exponents of his instrument like Nokie Edwards, Thom Bresh, John Jorgenson and Mason Williams, the young fingerstyle guitarist embodies the creative vision of a postmodern world: It's the music that counts. Brooks utilizes his superb technical abilities to play bass, rhythm and melody simultaneously and surpass the borders of conventional genres. He merges hauntingly beautiful compositions, country rhythms and jazzy harmonies with funky licks into his very own art form \u2013 sometimes delivered with a punch, sometimes with a smile. Brooks was born in Eugene, Oregon in 1989. Seeing Buster B. Jones perform at a festival near his home town became a life-changing experience for the kid from the sticks. Just eleven years old, he was immediately inclined to pick up the guitar. Soon, the world renowned fingerstyle virtuoso and instructor dedicated his spare time to introducing his new fan into the secrets of the fretboard, and after six months of lessons the natural talent performed his first show with his mentor. When Buster B. Jones took him under his wings, Brooks began playing high-profile gigs such as the Nokie Edwards Festival, the NAMM Show in Anaheim, the Montreal Jazz Festival or the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield among others. By the time he was a teenager he had become the youngest endorsee of Godin Guitars and traveled to several states and foreign countries to perform. Brooks went on to play on Garrison Keillor's National Public Radio classic \"A Prairie Home Companion\" in 2004, where he won first place in a talent competition for 12 to 20 year old participants. In recent years, while still appearing regularly at prestigious events like the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society (CAAS) Convention in Nashville, Brooks focused on perfecting his craft, soaking up new tunes and styles and techniques as well as blending them into his own groovy and soulful original music. He entered the \"Yamaha Six String Theory Guitar Competition\", which drew participants from more than 40 countries all over the world. Brooks was invited to perform in the finals at the Broad Stage in Los Angeles in March 2010. A star-studded jury, including Steve Lukather and Lee Ritenour, eventually chose him as winner of the country category and second place winner overall. Although he is deeply rooted in the powerful tradition of the genre, founded by the likes of Merle Travis, Jerry Reed, Thom Bresh and Buster B. Jones, Brooks also draws inspiration from the elegant mastery of the legendary Chet Atkins and other phenomenal players. His own compositions and arrangements have even been compared to fingerstyle jazz champions Lenny Breau and Earl Klugh. Now, as energy and maturity come together, this young man is ready to step out of his mentors' shadows and electrify the world with the sheer acoustic beauty his fingers create, when touching a set of strings. Quotes: \"Brooks Robertson has one of the very best techniques in fingerstyle guitar. You can hear the influences of Buster B. Jones, Jerry Reed, and all the great fingerpickers past ... and he's writing some fabulous new material. An amazing guitar player who's showing the rest of us how it's done! Nobody whops Brooks Robertson!\" Richard Smith (fingerstyle virtuoso) \"I was completely knocked out with the acoustic guitar virtuosity of Brooks Robertson! Brooks has a very original touch and sound plus monster chops. He's always making great music with his guitar. I'm sure Brooks will be sharing his music with the entire world and have an incredible career.\" Lee Ritenour (Grammy award winning guitarist ) \"He is slicker than a cat on a greased pole.\" Nokie Edwards (The Ventures, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) \"Brooks Robertson plays like the house is on fire.\" Thom Bresh (legendary thumbpicker) \"Brooks Robertson is well-equipped to carry on the legacy of Buster B Jones' powerful and funky guitar style. Any player would be very proud to have such an accomplished guitarist as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Brooks' personal playing and composing style is equally compelling, as audiences around the world are finding out. The solo guitar's future is in good hands with players like Brooks out there!\" John Jorgenson (Elton John, Desert Rose Band, Hellecasters) \"All guitar players are like Frankensteins. Their music is made out of bits and pieces of other players. In Brooks' case, he's a son of a Frankenchops, the well known monster picker Buster B. Jones. Buster and Brooks are both so scary ... the legend continues.\" Mason Williams (\"Mr. Classical Gas\") \"Brooks Robertson is a superb and exciting guitarist. I love his playing!\" Pat Bergeson (Chet Atkins, Jerry Reed, Lyle Lovett, Madeleine Peyroux) \"Brooks Robertson's playing is wonderful, rhythmically precise, harmonically complex and melodically compelling.

Krafft has garnered a significant following online, amassing over 4 million combined streams on Spotify, Soundcloud and YouTube between his original productions and remixes. His most recent collaboration with Pretty Lights Music artists Break Science demonstrates the ethereal electronic production that flows from the soundscapes of Krafft's music, and provides the listener with the smooth synths and dreamy ambiance signature of a Dreamers Delight track. \u201cDreamers Delight\u2026 weaves a middle road between reality and a transcendental fantasy \u2013 beautiful, uplifting and euphoric,\u201d says Magnetic Magazine. \u201cThe music that I\u2019m working on is representative of my unique experience, which makes it a little different than what\u2019s being put out elsewhere,\u201d says Krafft. \u201cThere\u2019s raw energy flowing, uplifting feels, and melodies that are meant to push you to a point of reflection \u2013 of oneself, the world and universe around us.

After years of dishonest living\u2014consumed by drugs, alcohol, and addiction\u2014such sincerity is jarring from the 30-year-old Chicago-based musician. Liberated from a self-destructive past and born anew in sobriety, Francis has captured an inspired collection of songs steeped in New Orleans rhythms, Chicago blues, and early 70s rock n\u2019 roll. His music evokes a bygone era of R&B\u2019s heyday while simultaneously forging a new path on the musical landscape. Ohio-based Karma Chief Records (a subsidiary of rising soul label Colemine Records) released his debut LP Changes in September 2019. There is a deep connection between Francis\u2019s childhood\u2014his obsession with boogie woogie piano, his father\u2019s gift of a dusty Dr. John LP\u2014and the songs he\u2019s created. The result is an astonishing collection of material without parallel in the contemporary funk and soul scene. The influences are unmistakable: the vocal stylings of Allen Toussaint and Leon Russell; the second line rhythms of The Meters and Dr. John; the barroom rock \u2018n\u2019 roll of The Rolling Stones; the gospel soul of Billy Preston; the roots music of The Band. Francis pays tribute to the masters but has his own story to tell: \u201cIt\u2019s the life I\u2019ve lived so far.\u201d And what a life it\u2019s been. Born Neal Francis O\u2019Hara, the piano prodigy found himself touring Europe by the age of 18 with Muddy Waters\u2019 son and backing up other prominent blues artists coast-to-coast. In 2012, Francis joined popular instrumental funk band The Heard. With Francis at the creative helm, The Heard transformed into a national act, touring with boogaloo progenitors The New Mastersounds and chart toppers The Revivalists and appearing at Jazz Fest and Bear Creek. As The Heard\u2019s star rose, however, Francis sunk deeper into addiction. Once a promising sideman, by 2015 he had been fired from his band, evicted from his apartment, and was perilously close to self-destruction. \u201cWhen you get close to death like that you can feel it,\u201d Francis recalls. An alcohol-induced seizure that year led to a broken femur, dislocated arm, and, finally, the realization that he needed to get clean. The journey from a hospital bed to launching his solo career was neither predictable nor straightforward. There were musical fits and starts, relapses, and broken relationships. Yet the overwhelming passion driving Francis in this second act has been an abundance of creative energy. \u201cDrinking held my music in a half-cocked slingshot. I was always so consumed by drugs and alcohol that I didn\u2019t have the time, money, or creative energy to do it. Sobriety let it loose.\u201d Determined to realize the songs swirling in his head, Francis assembled a crack team of musicians, calling on bassist Mike Starr (The Heard) and drummer PJ Howard (The Revivalists, The Heard). He linked up with producer and analog-obsessive Sergio Rios (Orgone, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys) and self-funded a trip to Killion Sound in Los Angeles to record the initial batch of material. \u201cI learned to trust my instincts in that room,\u201d says Francis. Buoyed by classic horn arrangements and Rios\u2019 fierce guitar work, the resulting tracks illuminate a lifetime spent studying the masters of rock and soul music. From the RMI electra-piano riff that kicks off \u201cShe\u2019s A Winner\u201d to the screaming organ swells of \u201cThis Time,\u201d Francis and company let it all hang out. This is fun music, dance music. Yet verse after verse and chorus after chorus, Francis wrestles with his past in a straightforward manner: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I\u2019m not home/ I\u2019m surrounded by people, but I\u2019m really alone.\u201d Like Toussaint and Russell before him he\u2019s married the upbeat rhythms of New Orleans R&B with the lyrical approach of a confessional singer/songwriter. The refrain on \u201cThis Time\u201d serves as a foxhole prayer for a better future: \u201cLet me get it this time/I won\u2019t let you down/Let me get it this time/I won\u2019t fool around.\u201d Francis finished recording basic tracks for Changes in Los Angeles in February of 2018 and spent the following months doing overdubs in Chicago with engineer Mike Novak (who also recorded demos for the project). Soon after he was eager to begin his touring career. After signing with Paradigm Talent Agency, Neal played shows across North American supporting Australian band The Cat Empire. He has received praise on several notable radio outlets including KEXP, KCRW\u2019s The Morning Becomes Eclectic, and BBC Radio 6. Francis and his four-piece band recently performed during the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, sharing the stage with The Meters and other legends. In 2019 alone he hit the road with Black Pumas, Steel Pulse, Lee Fields & The Expressions, Dumpstaphunk and others. Francis pledges to tour relentlessly to promote his own music. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to fulfill a drive within myself, but also to pay tribute to the gifts I\u2019ve been given. And it comes from a place of immense gratitude.\"", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "Parker, Parker, CO 80138", "Artist": "Zak Sloan ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8936845.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.5186002, -104.7613633], "Date": "2021-08-12", "EventDate": "Aug. 12th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Zak Sloan opening for Dear Marsha", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102802445-zak-sloan-at-wild-goose-saloon?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "As a plugged in singer/storyteller I steal the vibe of Petty and combine it with modern pop sensibility to create jangly pop/rock that is modern but never stripped of its classic rock roots. My music sounds like the Boss taught Matchbox Twenty how to fight. I've always been a musician, it just took me a long time to admit I was an artist. I only made it part way through music school before I left to make sure I had a backup plan. The thing was, the backup plan quickly became my actual trajectory. I became a 4th grade teacher in Aurora, Colorado. I loved it. I loved my students. But I knew I needed to do something more. I should have turned to music. Instead, I went to law school. I became a lawyer for abused & neglected children. I was in the children's homes, talking to them about their life experiences, fighting for them when nobody else would. Sometimes I was the only person in the courtroom who seemed to care about the safety of the kids. Again, I loved the work, but there was only so much punishment my psyche could take. It was time to start again, but this time I didn't make the same mistake. I never stopped making music. I played live whenever I could & was a hired gun guitarist for several years. Music was the one through-line in my life. I quit my lawyer job & went for music. I opened my own small studio, I produced other artists, & wrote songs with anybody who wanted to collaborate. I finished my album, \u201cNowhere, New Mexico\u201d then started releasing new singles as quickly as I could. I did everything possible to fill my life with music. Slowly, it started to pay off. My single \u201cPorcelain\u201d hit #1 on an indie chart. \"Next Saturday Night\" broke into the top 10. Indie radio stations started playing my music more & more. I am booking more shows than ever. The response to my music has been invigorating & humbling at the same time. My latest release, Balancing Act - EP1: Bar Crawling is the 1st half of an ambitious double EP that chronicles the circle of my journey from musician to lawyer to musician again. EP 2 will come out in 2019. When both EP's are played back to back a full concept album will be revealed.

He makes big, bold electronic music using walls of synths, twinkling melodies and amorphous bass rumbles. As such his two albums have seen him labelled by the likes of ambient patriarch Brian Eno as an electronic innovator while an impressive sweep of artists from Herbie Hancock to David Holmes, not to mention ballet choreographer Wayne McGregor, lo-fi folkster King Creosote and musical bluebloods Coldplay, have all called upon the 28-year-old Londoner's handiwork as a producer and composer. Which goes some way to explain why his new album Insides is his first in four years. Hopkins's aesthetic is perpetually intriguing. He transcends genres, melding digital coldness with subtle, bucolic textures; veering from skewed elegance to strange, unsettling depths. Insides' artfully constructed, unparalleled palette of rhythmic loops and treated piano can be partly explained by Hopkins' unusual adolescence; he was a child piano prodigy before discovering the bleeps and beeps of dance music. In his west London bedroom he balanced a teen obsession with acid house, early hardcore and grunge alongside weekend piano tutorials at the Royal College of Music. At 16 he flitted between the twilight stoner world of drum\u2018n\u2019bass pirate radio and German label Recycle or Die's hypnotic electronica, and the classical discipline of playing a Ravel piano concerto. H Hopkins honed his skills with years of experimentation on four-track tape recorders and old-school computer programs. After leaving school he toured Europe playing keyboards and samplers with Imogen Heap, before signing to Just Music aged 19. His first album, 2001's Opalescent, was written in a Wembley bedsit while he jobbed as a session keyboard-player and engineer. A collection of instrumental songs with an escapist, pastoral feel, it earned him a cult following amongst the electronica cognoscenti. Although he was still naive about rave culture and its comedowns, Opalescent unwittingly tapped into a cultural shift as rave morphed into downtempo. His second outing, Contact Note (2004), was a more evolved set: a cinematic, layered work with a harder experimental edge. It earned Hopkins comparisons to and praise from Brian Eno. An introduction to the sonic alchemist lead to sessions that were later released as part of Eno's album Another Day on Earth. It was this experience as well as collaborations with singer-songwriter King Creosote and the Fence Collective that lit the touch paper for the genuinely exploratory electronica of his forthcoming third album. Which is where we find Hopkins now: putting the finishing touches to Insides. He began work on it during autumn 2006. The following year he took a hiatus after being asked to produce King Creosote's album Bombshell. Around the same time he was introduced to Coldplay by Brian Eno, which led to a stint as an additional producer on their new album Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends. Indeed, the band were so taken with the track \u2018Light Through the Veins\u2019 - one of the most sublime moments of Hopkins\u2019 new set - that they\u2019ve used a reworked version to bookend Viva La Vida. Looking back on earlier, more rigidly sequenced work, Hopkins says he has moved away from the clinical accuracy of precision-tooled beats. \"I try to base what I do now on recordings of me drumming on something, or beatboxing badly,\" he says. It's this collision of human imperfection and digital circuitry that lends his latest album a brilliant tension. Its fluttering piano motifs are abruptly overpowered by the sort of brutal basslines that wouldn't be out of place tremoring the dancefloor at an east London dubstep night, or even accompanying avant-garde choreography \u2013 the first half of Insides formed the score to Wayne McGregor\u2019s recent contemporary dance production \u2018Entity\u2019, which premiered earlier this year at Sadler\u2019s Wells. The stunning beauty of tracks such as 'Vessel' and \u2018Colour Eye\u2019 has an ominous quality. Each track segues seamlessly into the next, with thunderous claustrophobic frequencies offset by familiar sounds - the submerged noise of cars on the street, birdsong, and cold currents of melody that open a window and let the day back in. Although steeped in the seriousness of classical composition, it is not a cerebral musical conceit for art boffs. It's hardly even a dance record. Insides is about strange contexts: natural, arcane textures welded to uneasy rhythms. Beautiful acoustic melodies set against jarring bass. Insides is, above all, an audacious album with a modernist luster and magical aura all of its own.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1400 Curtis Street, Denver, CO 80204", "Artist": "Fitz ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/2207572.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7447252, -104.9967231], "Date": "2021-08-12", "EventDate": "Aug. 12th, 2021", "Genre": "Alternative, New Wave Alternative", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Denver Performing Arts Complex", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1021986551-fitz-at-denver-performing-arts-complex?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Fitz and The Tantrums"}, {"Address": "4242 Wynkoop St,, Denver, CO 80216", "Artist": "Black Pumas ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9165245.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.776204, -104.969168], "Date": "2021-08-12", "EventDate": "Aug. 12th, 2021", "Genre": "Soul", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Mission Ballroom", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102572409-black-pumas-at-mission-ballroom?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Psychedelic soul based in Austin, TX.

For him, listening to the towering icons of his musician father\u2019s era\u2014Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, The Temptations\u2014was just as formative and exciting as discovering the new sounds of his own generation, and the beats and rhymes made by rising rap stars like Wu-Tang Clan, Kanye West, Notorious B.I.G., and Jay-Z inspired him in new ways.

Growing up as a student of dance, she became obsessed with uncovering rare and unusual music to use in her performances. As a result, she quickly became an avid digger and mixtape maker with an ever growing collection of singles. According to Erin, the first time she ever saw a DJ was at the Skate City skating rink and she was instantly transfixed. She desperately wanted that job and used to beg the poor guy to play her CDs. And he did. As she got older, that passion only compounded when she started attending raves and warehouse parties. There, she experienced dance as a liberating form of expression, saw turntables being used as instruments and continued to develop a taste for the sounds of the underground. Eventually, these experiences fueled the desire to share her music collection through the art of live mixing which led her to KGNU \u2013 an independent, non-commercial radio station \u2013 and simultaneously, into the world of Turntablism. Within these two communities she finally uncovered her life\u2019s purpose \u2013 to find and combine outstanding music. In 2019, Erin was named Best House DJ by The Denver Westword and has provided support for the likes of Claptone, AC Slater, Claude VonStroke & Nora En Pure.

The five-piece band boasts a mythical presence, a mischievous swagger, and mountainous riffs as huge as the nearby Copper Mountain, Colorado snowy summits. The band is headquartered in a high altitude and ruggedly rural region that receives 350 inches of snow yearly. It\u2019s a haven for skiers, snow bunnies, and extreme winter sports enthusiasts. Weaving in and out of the retreat luxury and the challenging slopes is the five-piece group\u2019s shadowy presence. The faint but feral roar of the band rehearsing wafts through the air. Its mascot, vocalist/drummer/ co-songwriter Frank Costantini\u2019s dog, Ozzie, tags snowmen built by neighboring children by urinating on them. Rock n\u2019 roll is alive and well, and still pissing people off. Dirty Snowman Society, co-founded by guitarist/co-songwriter Chris Todoroff, furthers the classic rock continuum with contemporary touches of grunge and alt-rock; purple psychedelic hues; and sprinkles of sinewy world-beat grooves often courtesy of percussionist Bashiri Johnson (Sting, Aretha Franklin, Steve Winwood). Adding to the group\u2019s mojo is a rural bravado informed by a vigorous outdoor lifestyle. Brand new drummer Perry Senn is a notorious touring musician and has shared the stage with the likes of Chuck Berry. The band has just released their second release, the EP Snow Blind. DSS\u2019s principle founders Frank and Chris live on opposite sides of a ski lift in a ski resort town, and the band writes, records, and rehearses at Frank\u2019s house. Frank is a full-time creative who has been awarded 7 Emmys for his writing, directing, and producing. In addition, he has worked in advertising writing, co-writing, and producing jingles alongside David Bowie, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Shaffer, Will Lee, Aaron Neville, Stewart Copeland, and Anton Fig. Band co-founder Chris is also a lifer musician who\u2019s logged time in numerous rock bands. Dirty Snowman Society also features ace lead guitarist/songwriter Johnnie Law and pro bassist Patrick Linfante. DSS\u2019s debut and sophomore EP have been produced by a remote NYC studio team helmed by producer/ Bangworld president Brian Jones. Dirty Snowman Society pairs bluesy riffs with infectious hooks, and, overall, the quintet\u2019s tracks are muscly, melodic, and tastefully layered. The musicians are dynamic and virtuosic, effortlessly shifting between telepathic ensemble playing and dexterous solo passages. Frank\u2019s vocals ooze a honeyed grit, recalling the era when lead vocalists were informed by blues shouters and soul balladeers. Lyrically, the band eschews the \u201cbaby baby\u201d trappings of many of its influences and contemporaries, instead the songwriters prefer to be thought-provoking using storylines pinched from everyday life struggles, politics, and romance. The band\u2019s smoldering emotive musicality recalls Alice In Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, and other beacons of the 1990s riff rock revival. Dirty Snowman Society\u2019s latest, Snow Blind, finds the guys making the most of pandemic-imposed sequestering. This is an artistically assured sophomore release that plays upon the strengths of its debut without retreading creative ground. The leadoff single, \u201cToo Much Is Never Enough,\u201d is cinematic and transporting, featuring tribal drums, angular grunge riffing, moody hooks, and dazzling guitar soloing. The song\u2019s animalistic wallop perfectly aligns with its insatiable themed lyrics heightened by phrases such as \u201cfeed the beast\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t get enough.\u201d \u201cMirror\u201d boasts scathing social media commentary by way of sleazy Bon Scott-era AC/DC rock n\u2019 roll. \u201cOnce\u201d is a standout romantic track, luxuriously layered with 12-string guitars, catchy harmony vocals, and ethnic percussive touches. \u201cKiss Me Or Kill Me\u201d is a good-time riff-rocker replete with an exhilarating fleet-fingered, wah-soaked guitar solo. Conceptually, the song dives into a darkly seductive fantasyland. The anthemic, \u201cSay Nothing,\u201d epitomizes the Dirty Snowman Society aesthetic. It seamlessly mixes the lysergic musicality of Cream, the brawny riffage of Led Zeppelin, and the rousing dynamics of Smashing Pumpkins. The tune\u2019s imaginative arrangement features a moody arabesque breakdown and guitar solos that are both funky and fluid. This rousing tune is a timely call to arms\u2014if you say nothing you\u2019ll be nothing. Up next, Dirty Snowman Society is conceptualizing and putting into production a mesmerizing live show to bring Copper Mountain rock n\u2019 roll to the masses, pandemic be damned.

I knew we had to be killing it, standing in that church rec center in front of all my high school peers at the time. The cymbals sizzling, bass drum pounding, bass guitar rattling your guts. Pure teenage angst, bouncing off the walls, an echoing dance of frequencies. I tried to remember to breath as my fingers in high strung discord slid wildly along the fretboard. It was my first live solo, and it was if just for moment the world had seemed to stop. I wanted the moment to last forever, though merely a brief passing of time. In hindsight, we probably weren\u2019t all I thought we were cracked up to be, but my first guitar solo as a teenager in that church rec center was enough to keep me hooked for life. From early piano lessons, too passing through a variety of school band instruments, music seemed to find a way in one way or another into my life. I can remember the sounds of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens coming through the stereo as kid. As my teenage years hit, music was a way to escape. A way to seem cool and distance myself from all the bullies in school. There was something so freeing about strumming a few power chords until my ear rang at jam sessions after school Eventually my escape became a fascination more intense and artists from the likes of Roy Buchanan, to Pink Floyd, Branford Marsalis, Miles Davis, Trane and Mahivishnu began to infiltrate the tape deck. After leaving home in Charlotte, NC, and heading off to Appalachian State, a new world of tunes found their way into my heart, from the Flecktones, to Acoustic Syndicate, and Leo Kottke. Diving deep into jazz and theory classes, while playing in jam bands, my tastes evolved, and while I knew I loved jazz, I truly found joy in blending a variety of music, and melding styles from the likes of jazz, funk, blues, americana, rock, soul, and bluegrass. In the twenty plus year that I\u2019ve performed professionally, I\u2019ve had the good fortune and honor of being able to share the stage with a variety of top notch performers. My family has made their home outside of Denver, CO, and you can usually find me performing in venues from coffee shops to concert halls. While I frequent a variety of different types of venues, my intention remains true to be a genuine as possible in what I do and never forget that you never can tell who is listening.

Then came \u2018Okay,\u2019 the track that \u201cchanged the way we listened to music\u201d (Dancing Astronaut) and became the anthem of 2014. It claimed the #1 position on Beatport\u2019s House chart for 82 days, remained in the House Chart\u2019s Top 10 for over 180 days, was put on rotation by radio tastemakers like Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard and received support from the likes of Claude VonStroke, Eats Everything, Green Velvet and nearly every major DJ under the sun. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed \u2018Okay\u2019 a \u201cglobal club sensation in waiting,\u201d a prophetic description that couldn\u2019t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in DJ sets even to this day. Shiba San\u2019s debut release on DFTD, \u2018All I Need\u2019 with fellow Frenchman Tim Baresko, dominated Beatport\u2019s overall chart at the #1 position for over a month. The song landed on multiple \u2018Best of 2018\u2019 lists, with notable support from influential tastemakers, such as Pete Tong, Calvin Harris, Jack Back (David Guetta), among others. With over 15 #1 Beatport tracks, there\u2019s a reason why DJ Mag France named Shiba San \u2018Best of House.\u2019 His critically acclaimed record label, Basement Leak, is home to some of the finest tech house tracks on the scene right now. Since the label\u2019s inception in 2017, Basement Leak has taken over stages at renowned festivals and curated its own events at Art Basel, Miami Music Week, FriendShip, Groove Cruise, Sound Nightclub in Los Angeles and Faust in Paris. Staying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan base, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent concocting in the studio, Shiba San remains a mainstay on the nightlife and festival circuit around the globe.

There, she experienced dance as a liberating form of expression, saw turntables being used as instruments and continued to develop a taste for the sounds of the underground.

Among its members are multi-platinum selling solo artists, multi-platinum record producers, Grammy winners, TV and film stars, screenwriters, product spokespersons, business owners and, most recently, major motion picture composers. The Clan featured nine MCs until the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard in 2004. One of the most critically and commercially successful hip hop groups of all time, Wu-Tang Clan shot to fame through their uncompromising brand of hardcore rap music. Since their debut, they have introduced or launched the careers of numerous other artists and groups, and already in 1994 there were credited to be over 300 Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, consisting of rappers, producers, and record label CEOs. The founders of the Wu-Tang Clan were RZA, GZA, and Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had previously formed the group Force of the Imperial Master (later known as All in Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name). The group attracted the attention of some notable figures in the industry, including Biz Markie, but did not manage to secure a record deal. After the crew dissolved, GZA (then known as The Genius) and The RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem) embarked on their solo careers with Cold Chillin' Records and Tommy Bricks Records respectively, but to little success. Their frustration with the workings of the hip hop music industry would provide the main inspiration to Wu-Tang Clan's revolutionary business plan. According to The Wu-Tang Manual, at the group's inception, RZA promised the members that if he had total control of the Wu-Tang empire, it would conquer the hip-hop world within a dynastic cycle, after which he would relinquish his total control. Wu-Tang Clan was gradually assembled in late 1992 from friends and accomplices from around Staten Island, New York, with The RZA as the de facto leader and the group's producer. Two of the cousins, GZA (pronounced Jizza) and The RZA (pronounced Rizza), created their new Wu-Tang aliases by mimicking the sound that the words \"genius\" and \"razor\" would make when scratched on a turntable. \"Wu-Tang\" comes from the name of the Taoist holy mountain Wu Dang in northwest Hubei Province in central China; it was also the site of the Ming Dynasty Purple Imperial City built during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. The RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after seeing the Kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang, which features a school of warriors trained in Wu-Tang style. The group's debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections and using dialogue excerpts as skits. The group have also developed various backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers like KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including \"We Usually Take All the Niggas' Garments,\" \"Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game\" and \"Wisdom, Universe, Truth, Allah, Nation, and God\". Method Man has also mentioned that the \"Wu\" is the sound a sword makes when cutting through the air, and \"Tang\" is the sound it makes against a shield. The Clan first became known to hip hop fans, and to major record labels, in 1993 (see 1993 in music) following the release of the independent single \"Protect Ya Neck\", which immediately gave the group a sizeable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in late 1993. This album was popular and critically-acclaimed, though it took some time to gain momentum. Though hip hop had long had a gritty texture, the surreal aggression and minimalist production of 36 Chambers nevertheless had a huge impact on the genre, and was to prove massively influential over the next decade. By the beginning of the 21st century, the album had become a regular fixture on \"Best Albums Of The 90s\" lists as well as a frequent choice for \"Best Albums Of All Time\" lists. The success of Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers established the group as a creative and influential force in early 1990s hip hop, allowing GZA, The RZA, Raekwon,Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Ol' Dirty Bastard to negotiate solo contracts.", "otherInfo": "Wu-Tang Clan w/ Colorado Symphony"}, {"Address": "900 Colorow Rd, Golden, CO 80401", "Artist": "Ren\u00e9 Moffatt Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9886326.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7313565, -105.2484478], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Private Wedding", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102652694-rene-moffatt-music-at-boettcher-mansion-lookout-mt?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Ren\u00e9 Moffatt is a Denver-based singer/songwriter serving up heavy pours of poignant lyrics and resonant melodies.

Karns has enjoyed an undeniable reputation long-sealed by his on stage and in studio work with some industry heavyweights like Yelawolf, Bun B., Kid Rock, Paul Wall, Bassnectar and Travis Barker. This is not a man who gets on iTunes, downloads a few hits and calls it a day, but rather an accomplished master of his craft. At a time when the word \u201cDJ\u201d no longer carries with it the weight of a once vibrant vinyl culture, it\u2019s a relief there are passionate and talented artists like Chris. Since his early days inspired by his musician father and learning to scratch on a $20 belt-drive turntable, he\u2019s rocked countless overseas and American tours, and has played everywhere from Los Angeles to New York, London to Tokyo, and everywhere in between. Since being honored with the highest possible battle title and becoming DMC World Champion, Karns is now known as one of the fastest scratchers and beat jugglers in the game, incorporating drum machines and other components into sets stacked with raw energy.

But both bands have an improvisational approach to their live shows, and it is in that spontaneity where the magic really happens. The guys in DPO have posed themselves a unique challenge in merging the two styles. Set lists end up with segues that look like Divided Sky > Morning Dew > Divided Sky, or Help > Slip > Frankenstein.

Randomly. He can\u2019t really tell you why. Maybe it\u2019s that \u201cno-fear-of-the-edge\u201d mentality that hooks the non-country-lovin\u2019 folk while he manages to maintain a balance of traditional vibes that will remind you of a modern day John Wayne. He's a 6\u20194\u201d bass-baritone powerhouse who once hit 200 million television sets worldwide as a contestant on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d With each performance he fights to create something electric, something that grabs you and makes you look up. Maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe that\u2019s why some people don\u2019t like country and yet... they like him. The most common question a singer will be asked is, \u201cWhen did you start singing?\u201d Buckstein has always had the same answer: \u201cWhen I found out that the chicks dig it.\u201d Sounds like a punchline but it\u2019s actually the truth. He was 13, at summer camp, trying to figure out how to meet girls like everyone else. A couple of girls were singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and he shyly scooted up next to them and started singing along. \u201cWhen they found out I could sing they immediately introduced me to all the other girls in the camp,\u201d he grins. \u201cI\u2019ve been singing ever since.\u201d His love of country music is thanks to his father who played it all the time when he was young even though he hated the genre. \u201cIt takes one good country song to hook ya!\u201d Buckstein warns. \u201cMine was probably \u2018Thunder Rolls\u2019 by Garth Brooks or \u2018This Ain\u2019t No Thinking Thing\u2019 by Trace Adkins. I heard those tunes when I was about 11 or 12 and something just clicked\u2014I was hooked.\u201d He continued to grow up a country boy at heart often retreating to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. However, since he always lived in the city, the rest of his musical tastes fall outside of the expected box, running a gamut that includes blues, rock, rap, classics from the \u201950s, and whatever was on Top 40 radio at any given time. Buckstein studied theater in college, earning his BA from California State University, Fullerton. Prior to \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d he had moved to LA to pursue a career as an actor. \u201cBig surprise, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d he confides. \u201cOne day a few friends of mine went to the \u2018American Idol\u2019 auditions, which was the hottest show on TV at the time. They wanted some company so I went along. I got through and they didn\u2019t. It was Idol that set me on a different path.\u201d After appearing on the finale of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in Season 5, he returned to Denver with music on the brain. He started singing with whomever would back him up, growing along the way, learning his craft, year after year, little by little, making friends, music, mistakes, and big moves, all leading him to today. \u201cThose years were invaluable,\u201d he says. \u201cThey call it \u2018paying your dues.\u2019 It always sounded like a bad thing. But I found out paying your dues can be some of the most fun you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d Over the past few years Buckstein has traveled all over Colorado and the Midwest region performing for soon-to-be-lifelong fans. He admits to laughing to himself when other performers come to Colorado and complain about how hard it is to sing at such a high altitude. Buckstein, being a true native of the 5280 state, has never had a problem. With the help of his band, \u201cThe Heard\u201d (his rotating roster of professionals), he has rocked crowds opening for Charlie Daniels, Dustin Lynch, Old Dominion, Eli Young, John Michael Montgomery, Mark Chesnutt, Vanilla Ice, and many, many others. He\u2019s gained local fame as a regular guest star on Denver\u2019s hottest country station 98.5 KYGO and also as the writer and performer of \u201cThe Grizzly Rose,\u201d which is a popular song about the famous Denver nightclub, and he produced a music video for the track. Buckstein wrote the song about his personal experiences after his first week playing at the legendary venue. He began, as most do, singing covers of all of the artists he was most influenced by. Buckstein embraces covers and thinks that no matter what, \u201cthere should always be room in your set to pay homage to the artists and songs that have touched your life. Even when you\u2019re selling out arenas with your own stuff you can do that. I have a saying: \u2018Today we play the songs that others have written\u2026 so that someday we may play the songs that we have written\u2026 so that someday others may play the songs that we have written.\u2019 You gotta put those pauses in there for dramatic effect,\u201d he laughs. Buckstein is currently embarking on his next chapter with his newest EP, Country Side. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heart in these five tunes,\u201d Buckstein says. \u201cMaking them has been a very valuable experience. It has shown me not only where I am but where I want to go from here.\u201d Buckstein\u2019s goal is to bring soul to everything he does. \u201cWhat people seem to respond most to in my live performances is my passion, so I worked hard to bring that passion to the record. My sound gets compared a lot to the great bass-baritones of my time: Trace Adkins, Toby Keith, Josh Turner, and Chris Young. But I personally hate comparisons. I don\u2019t think Josh Turner wants to hear he sounds like Don Williams,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI just wanna sound like me. If my sound were a drink, I'd like to think it would come in a bottle with a cork instead of a twist cap. And I'd like to say it's got a crisp bite with a smooth finish.\u201d He gives all the thanks in the world to his fans and his crew: \u201cWithout the people who support me, on stage and off, this would all be for nothing. I try to always surround myself with good people who want to make good music for other good people.\u201d And if you\u2019re still wondering, it\u2019s pronounced \u201cBuck-steen.\u201d www.bucksteinmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "918 W 1st Ave, Denver, CO 80223", "Artist": "Cosmic Charlies ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [39.7176452, -104.9992656], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "So Many Roads Museum and Brewery", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022559648-cosmic-charlies-at-so-many-roads-museum-and-brewery?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3560 Chestnut Pl, Denver, CO 80216", "Artist": "Many Mountains ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11549321.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7722073, -104.9793189], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie Rock, Indie, Americana, Folk Rock, Alternative Folk", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Many Mountains @ Number Thirty Eight!

Mark Brut certainly fits that mold. Hailing from Philadelphia and now based in Denver, Brut also spent the past 12 years in the south, mainly in Atlanta and the great music town of Athens, GA. He maintains strong roots to his hometown and has become entrenched in the Colorado music community, but also absorbed much of the music and culture that the south has to offer. Mark's writing continually touches on the same subjects...how your experiences mold you as a person, finding hope and dealing with disappointment and trying to make sense of \"what you do and what you see.\" Songs such as \"Never Been to North Dakota\", \"High Country\" and \"Rest Stop\" certainly fall in these categories. Beyond the songs, Mark's strength lies in his guitar playing, as a rhythmic and melodic acoustic player to an expressive electric player. While performing solo acoustic or electric in a band setting, Brut's passion for life bleeds over into his playing. The diversity of his influences also is evident as you hear him play. Brut is also powerful as a cover artist, drawing from many different artists and making the songs his own. Mark Brut plays both solo acoustic and fronts the Denver-based band The Sneaky Bastards. \"like the first time...I return again...\"", "otherInfo": "Mark Brut\nsolo acoustic\nWash Park Grille - Denver, CO\n8/13/2021 (Fri)\n8:00-1100 pm"}, {"Address": "2637 Welton St, Denver, CO 80205", "Artist": "VEIL_ ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11630880.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.75453640000001, -104.9788397], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Glitch Hop, Halftime, Bass Music, Drum & Bass, Dubstep, Psybass", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "VEIL B2B NotL\u00f6 at Cervantes' Other Side", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102811524-veil_-at-cervantes'-masterpiece-ballroom-and-cervantes'-other-side?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "The very existence of such a realm defies imagination.

Portland-based singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Jay Cobb Anderson accepts the responsibility of such sonic discourse via his solo output. Moreover, he deciphers these universal experiences in the form of hummable, hypnotic, and heartfelt anthems steeped in storytelling folk tradition and amplified by unabashed rock \u2018n\u2019 roll energy. His seven-song 2019 EP immediately strikes an emotional chord. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like I had a duty to be a voice for the average person\u2014and mostly for their frustrations, loneliness, and struggles,\u201d he affirms. \u201cThe plight of the human condition is very confusing at times. We live in the age of information, and we\u2019re still so much like animals. I feel like a great voice for that. I\u2019m like a pendulum swinging hard from intellect and sensitivity to complete primal instincts and animal passion.\u201d He developed a knack for such writing via his downright prolific career thus far. Not only did he co-found folk rock phenomenon Fruition, but he also launched groups such as The Bell Boys and Rose City Thorns. His growing catalog includes 10 albums and multiple EPs, while he\u2019s logged hundreds of gigs since launching his career in 2007. He served up his first solo offering, I\u2019m a Rambler, I\u2019m a Fool, during 2012. Constantly writing, he challenged himself to crank out a song a day since his birthday October 12, 2018. In the midst of this creative whirlwind, he carved out time in 2018 to hit the studio alongside Fruition drummer Tyler Thompson once again behind the board as producer. It proved to be just the right moment for his sophomore solo album as they retreated to Thompson\u2019s studio. \u201cFruition has been touring nationally really hard for the past seven years,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was a challenge to find time in between. Along the way, I never stopped making my own music. So, I picked some of the material from the 100 songs that was more personal and specific to me and started recording them for eventual EPs. This is an outlet to fully get my vision out there and be completely me.\u201d Spanning seven years between solo releases, he widened his palette of inspiration. Musically, he developed a deep appreciation for Bahamas and maintained his longstanding Tom Waits fascination. At the same time, \u201cbooks had been a big part of the last few years\u201d as he devoured classics from Charles Bukowski and Kurt Vonnegut. Drawing on the talents of his Fruition family, Jeff Leonard (also of Fruition) contributed bass. Anderson handled guitars, vocals, keys, mellotron, and \u201ceverything else.\u201d The subject matter reflected marked growth. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of changes,\u201d he goes on. \u201cI put out my last solo record when I was 27. It\u2019s still in the same vein as the original solo album where the lyrics were super important. The vibe is just different. You could say I\u2019m older and maybe a little wiser,\u201d he laughs. The first single \u201cEverything Is Gonna Work It\u2019s Own Self Out\u201d illuminates his evolution in under two minutes. A stop-and-start beats gallops in tandem with high-energy guitars as his soulful wail carries an upbeat and undeniable refrain punctuated by a punchy bounce. \u201cIt discusses hardship in society and trying to work through everything as it also touches on repression,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was all on my mind at the time. As an artist, it\u2019s hard to do this and survive. You go through all of these processes in your head, wondering what you\u2019re doing on the road and if you\u2019d be happier with a nine-to-five and paid vacation. In exploring those frustrations, you swallow your emotions and gain the faith to keep going.\u201d Elsewhere, the stripped down live performance of \u201cSo Far From You\u201d details \u201ca relationship that ended\u201d by way of unfiltered lyricism and stark emotion. \u201cLeave Me\u201d nods to Bahamas, and \u201cLittle Glowing Screen\u201d takes on our smartphone addiction complete with \u201cweird phone sounds\u201d to enhance the atmosphere. Then, there\u2019s the sweaty and sticky closing rocker \u201cBaby I\u2019m Yours,\u201d which gets down and dirty replete with a shredding solo. \u201c\u2018Baby I\u2019m Yours\u2019 is something I never would\u2019ve had on the first record. Most heavier rock I would\u2019ve played with the Rose City Thorns. Since that band is done, I feel more comfortable expressing the more sexy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll sides of myself within this project. It\u2019s a song all about sex, and it\u2019s got a lot of heat to it,\u201d he grins. In the end, Anderson positions himself as a relatable and real voice for the modern age. \u201cHopefully, you can connect to it, and maybe it helps you through whatever shit you\u2019re going through,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cMaybe you forget about what\u2019s driving you crazy and you\u2019re able to have a good time and let it all out, if only for a moment.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Mama Magnolia with Jay Cobb Anderson and Carolyn Hunter"}, {"Address": "608 E 13th Ave., Denver, CO 80203", "Artist": "David Starfire Music ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11603274.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7367329, -104.9794787], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Trap, World Bass Glitch Music, Dubstep, World Beat, World Fusion, House, Worldbeat, Glitch Hop", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Pre-Burn Party at Your Mom's House With David Starfire", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102554509-david-starfire-music-at-your-mom's-house?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Named by BBC Radio as \u201cOne of the most brilliant world-fusion producers of our time\u201d, David Starfire is known as the pioneer of the Global Bass genre.

And this is why Vasi Vallis brought \u2018Reaper\u2019 to life in 2005, a music project which was not supposed to follow the path of the softer sounds of \u2018NamNamBulu\u2019 and \u2018Frozen Plasma\u2019. Basic idea was, that this project should be fun and not take things too seriously. While hard beats meet with catchy and earworm-like melodies and combine to a danceable mix, which makes the listener hum long parts of the song, the band's lyrics deal with all the clich\u00e9s that can be subsumed under the superordinate \u2018evil\u2019. The band plays quite obviously with topics such as death, Satan, sex and women, not without a healthy portion of sarcasm. Perfectly fitting to all those clich\u00e9s, \u2018Reapers\u2019 first EP was named \u2018Angst\u2019. With their following debut album \u2018Hell starts with an H\u2019, Vasi Vallis was joined by Gregor Beyerle to support \u2018Combichrist\u2019 on their tour across Europe that made a lot of people fall in love with their music.

By the end of 2007 the EP \u2018The Devil is Female\u2019 was released and made it directly to #1 of the DAC (German Alternative Charts). What followed was a tour in conspicuous outfits as well as additional musical support on guitars and drums. All that made \u2018Reaper\u2019 play the bigger scene festivals around the world. After taking a creative break, the band is coming back with a new album in 2016 \u2013 of course once again with melodies from hell, pure evil and a huge portion of subliminal humour.", "otherInfo": "Kayzo"}, {"Address": "1136 Broadway, Denver, CO 80203", "Artist": "Wolfgang Gartner ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9017745.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7344495, -104.9870049], "Date": "2021-08-13", "EventDate": "Aug. 13th, 2021", "Genre": "Electro House, Electronic, Dance Music", "Time": "10:00 PM", "Venue": "Temple Nightclub Denver", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022679872-wolfgang-gartner-at-temple-nightclub-denver?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "\u201cI have to make something that\u2019s never been made before; have to make the best thing that I\u2019ve ever done in my life - otherwise it gets stagnant or worse,\u201d says producer/DJ Wolfgang Gartner. Whether or not his progressively more maximilist take on electro-house is your bag or not, you have to respect his exponentially steep rise through the electro-house ranks. And Lord knows, you\u2019ve heard it -- or about it: flipping Beethoven\u2019s 5th for the 4 am crowd; eight #1 tracks on Beatport; remix/collabs with Britney Spears, Timbaland and Black Eyed Peas; festival-highlight performances at Coachella \u201810 and Electric Daisy Carnival\u2019s \u201810 and \u201811. Where Joey Youngman, the one-time party kid from San Luis Obispo, CA and another-time househead old soul, has been electro-house\u2019s dark (work) horse, Weekend in America, his debut full-length for Ultra Music, is Wolfgang Gartner becoming dance music\u2019s one-man parallel universe, outpacing electro-house and outdoing himself. \u201cOne of my mantras is that I have a responsibility to advance the genre. If I\u2019m capable of doing something I\u2019ve never done before, I feel like I have to use that ability, because there are not many people who do - or can. I have to push myself real real hard to do it. That\u2019s something that\u2019s really surfaced with this record,\u201d he admits. Gartner\u2019s work ethic is mythical amongst even his most storied contemporaries: Make music all week. Play it out all weekend. His DJ sets - and this speaks to a combination of prolificness, personal taste and a proven track record - are almost entirely made up of edits of his own work. Then again, when you spend 20 hours a day working on music... \u201cMaybe it\u2019s like an insecurity and not being satisfied listening to it over and over, but I\u2019m constantly asking myself \u2018Could it be better?\u2019 It could take me three hours to add this little milisecond sound that nobody but me will ever know is there, but I do it,\u201d Gartner says of his somehow self-effacing self-confidence. \u201cI get into tweaker mode; I\u2019m just sitting there tweaking for ten hours straight on this sound or that track and putting everything together and coming up with something else.\u201d Take \u201cForever,\u201d the menacingly not-what-you\u2019d-expect will.i.am collab on Weekend In America. It\u2019s a track that, with its ominous chord progression and middla-nowhere \u201cRIP\u201d shout-out to DJ AM from will, is as unlikely as it is, literally, amazing. \u201cThat\u2019s just me sitting with my keyboard and pounding out chord progressions for three days and coming up with a hundred or so and some of them are good and a few of them are great, until finally I get to that one where I can say, \u2018This is something I can spend three weeks making into something,'\u201d says Gartner. He attributes this spike in his equal parts obsessive-compulsive/obsessive-creative disorder in part to his recent move from Austin, TX to Los Angeles. \u201cI had one friend in Austin - who I met for breakfast once every six weeks. I woke, up, went to Starbucks, made music, drove to the airport, flew out, and flew home. My studio was in the master bedroom. With my house in California, it\u2019s in a guest room - I decided I want to make the master bedroom for sleeping.\u201d There are no love songs on Weekend In America, but there is a new love: hip-hop. \u201cStill My Lady\u201d features Omarion, Dipset\u2019s Jim Jones and Cam\u2019ron trade verses on \u201cCircus Freaks,\u201d and Eve brings it on \u201cGet \u2018Em\u201d as highlights on the album. \u201cRap music is actually all I listen to when I can just listen to music, like in my car. I spend so much time listening to dance music, rap is something I can just enjoy,\u201d Wolfgang Gartner explains. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to do all these collaborations with rappers to be trendy,\u201d he adds. \u201cI reached out to each of them to make sure they were down and understood where I was coming from. I honestly like hip-hop almost as much as I like dance music, so it\u2019s a perfect combination.\u201d It should come as no surprse then that the track that opens Weekend In America is \u201cGet \u2018Em\u201d featuring Eve. Gartner explains: \u201cI was in New York playing Pacha so I actually went into the studio and worked with her on the track, looping it, trying stuff out,\u201d he says. \u201cShe came up with, \u2018Party round the world/All my fly people no nasty girls/Jet planes baby that\u2019s me/Come on people now sing along with me.\u2019 We knew that was the hook. It sounds like something Sugarhill Gang would have done, like it knows it\u2019s this classic-sounding hook.\u201d The addition of rappers is all part of the progression of Weekend In America, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s getting progressively harder to make music without hearing vocals and vocal melodies on it - that\u2019s what comes naturally to me.\u201d Of course, \u201cnaturally\u201d is an evolving word in the Wolfgang Gartner lexicon. As \u201cMenage A Trois\u201d proves, you don\u2019t need a vocalist to hear voices. Another of Gartner\u2019s mantras is that he\u2019s making music for the future, and \u201cMenage A Trois\u201d sounds straight outta 2016: fully articulated synth lines trading verses in their own freaked-frequencies like MCs spitting in some as-yet undecipherable tongue. \u201cThe thing that makes that track for me is how conceptually different it is for me,\u201d Gartner offers. \u201cIt\u2019s literally just a bunch of random pieces from all over the place and some Fender Rhodes piano and this bass tone and then this vocal snippet that sounds like it\u2019s saying \u2018Menage A Trois.\u2019\u201d Random, yes, but Weekend In America is nothing if not inspired by Wolfgang Gartner\u2019s almost contradictory need to evoke his best live moments while pushing himself to top them - and then gig some more to create new moments to top: \u201cMantra number three for me is that when I\u2019m writing I think about the last really amazing show that was f$%ing unbelievable for whatever reason - everything I make is designed for playing out. I get super tired of playing out every weekend, having one day at home. But I know I need to get out there - I have to do it for market research,\u201d he says. As Weekend In America proves, it\u2019s often the tracks that are most obsessed over privately that make the biggest impact publicly. Take the Electric Daisy Carnival festival \u201811 favorite \u201cSpace Junk,\u201d caned as it was in several sets, which seems to take everything great and terrible over the last 15 years of dance music - vintage synths, hands-in-the-air trance flutter and dubstep\u2019s modulated stammer, and fits it in one track - often in a single measure, sometimes even a single bar. \u201cThat\u2019s the one that haunts me,\u201d Youngman admits. \u201cThat\u2019s the one I\u2019m always trying to top.\u201d Ironically, it\u2019s also the one that contradicts another Wolfgang Gartner myth: that Youngman is himself a gearhead. \u201cI\u2019m actually working on Windows XP with limited RAM, on Abelton and three vintage synths - one of which I don\u2019t even use anymore,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy computer\u2019s constantly freezing up and maxing out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m more concerned with music than technology. I\u2019m willing to write the entire breakdown of \u2018Space Junk\u2019 on an old keyboard with a busted arpeggiator that comes out so muddy that I have to deal with the hassle of spending a whole day editing it in 16th notes,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut the fact that it came out of a synth - and not a plug-in - makes it totally worth the day I spent.\u201d Likewise \u201cIllmerica,\u201d with its long, phantasmic synthesizer chord progression, belie the heart of a composer over the somehow soulful rhythm sections that chug and chew more than chop or churn- Youngman\u2019s past life as a Kerri Chandler-loving househead living on. That, he says, and his other past life: third grade piano virtuoso. \u201cMy parents made me take classical lessons,\u201d Gartner laughs. \u201cI played in competitions at local colleges with a bunch of other ten year-olds and I think I won a couple of them. Now I couldn\u2019t play to save my life, but that foundation is there.\u201d And therein might lay the greatest mantra/myth of the Wolfgang Gartner story and the greatest contradiction of Weekend in America: that it\u2019s just dance music. \u201cI would think I would hate what\u2019s mainstream, but the truth of it is, the dance world makes sense to me,\u201d says Wolf. \u201cI understand how and why it creates the response that it does with people.\u201d That said, as Weekend in America shows in its byzantine soul, kaleidoscopic command of frequencies and impossibly imaginative arrangements, Weekend in America the artist is answering to an altogether higher power and potential, one the Wolfgang Gartner massive has the good fortune of being able to get onto the floor and out of their heads to every weekend. But for Wolfgang Gartner, the introverted empath spending thousands of hours in isolation making these tracks that will connect him to tens, even hundreds of thousands of people at a time, Weekend In America is party-rocking speaker-freq\u2019-ing as self-realization. \u201cI can imagine it and I know something amazing that\u2019s never been heard before is possible. Occasionally it\u2019s even something I can already hear in my head and that\u2019s why I have to make this music.\u201d snapchat: wolfgizzle www.twitter.com/wolfganggartner https://www.instagram.com/wolfganggartner/", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3101 S Kipling St, Lakewood, CO 80227", "Artist": "Cory M.

Wells is an alternative singer/songwriter from Charlotte, NC. Hailing from New Orleans, LA, born into a family of musicians, Cory finds himself armed with a 6 string Alvarez acoustic guitar at 15 years old, and a fiery rage to send his love of music out into the open heart. Crafting his guitar, piano and violin skills, he embarks early on a mission to write songs based on his extraordinary and challenging life, leading him into forming his first music project, a duo named Jacobs Well. Inspired by the honest and raw storytelling of Rob Thomas , Wells finds solace and escape from broken home to grouphomes by putting life's struggle and trials into lyrics and melodies. This will later shape Well's trademark melancholic yet powerfully soaring vocal reminiscent of the great classic rock vocalists of the 80's. At only 17, Cory enters and wins the prestigious ''Queen City Idol'' competition with ''Jacobs Well''. Consequently he forms wildly edgy rock band MANIC at 19, earning much notoriety, titles in music competitions by regional radio stations and a successful tour of the US. Wells later reconstructs and re-names the band to FALLING THROUGH APRIL, leading to label opportunities, festival appearances, support slots for established acts like Third Eye Blind, and studio sessions with renowned producers such as Rene Moore ( Rene & Angela, Jay-Z, Michael Jackson) and Mitch Easter (R.E.M.). The band remains together touring for several years before parting ways, and Cory follows up with his debut EP release of ''The New Old'' under his new project ''Subliminal Confession'', featuring a sold out EP release in Charlotte. Staying true to his heart, in a passionate pursuit of a solo career beginning in 2016, Cory's music currently goes under the name of Cory M. Wells. In anticipation of releasing his debut solo EP, ''Out from the dark'' on May 4, Wells released his debut music video for his single ''Running Wild'', and embarks on a 20 date US tour from September 2018. Often compared to Dallas Green and James Bay, Wells puts his own stamp on heartfelt melodic rock with vocal loops, stunning harmonies and honest stories of life's unexpected turns, family, long distance love, finding strength in loss, and turning pain into something beautiful.", "otherInfo": "Greasing the wheels with a sneaky acoustic set of all new material at this lovely little place."}, {"Address": "2300 Steele St, Denver, CO 80205", "Artist": "Splash ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8037288.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7491023, -104.9520274], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Liquid, House, Chill, Bass, Edm, Etc, Trap, Drum, Electronic", "Time": "10:00 AM", "Venue": "The Denver Zoo", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022650448-splash-at-the-denver-zoo?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Mikey and Devin started their love for music in Middle School, trying out instruments.

Gone is the young Louisiana gunslinger who erupted onto the early-\u201990s scene with his burn-it-down guitar solos and gut-punch songcraft. The man he\u2019s become is even more magnetic, still pushing his Fender Strat where others fear to fret, while diving deep into human truths and personal evolution with an honesty that only comes with miles on the clock. If that quarter-century journey has taught Shepherd anything, it\u2019s that there\u2019s no such thing as mission accomplished. A restless creativity has driven Shepherd ever since he taught himself to play guitar at the age of 7. A musician in constant motion, Shepherd has spent his career burning up the highways and crossing continents, bringing his unique style of rock/blues to the world. Like all the great songwriters, Shepherd\u2019s studio catalogue has always been the best way to get to know the reserved musician. His path was set from childhood, as he copped the licks from the records brought home by his radio DJ/Program Director father and was sent reeling from a \u201clife-changing\u201d meeting with Stevie Ray Vaughan to make his own stage debut at the age of 13. With early albums like his Platinum selling Ledbetter Heights, his Platinum selling Trouble Is\u2026, his Gold selling Live On and The Place You\u2019re In, the blues-rock scene hailed its most honest new songwriter and guitar hero with a plethora of awards including two Billboard Music Awards, two Orville H. Gibson Awards and two Grammy nominations. Shepherd continued writing, recording and touring, chronicling the highs and hard times, while dousing his shows with guitar pyrotechnics. \u201cThe first five years of my career,\u201d he remembers, \u201cI was on tour non-stop. I\u2019d probably go home for two weeks a year.\u201d The year 2007 brought the ambitious Platinum selling DVD/CD project 10 Days Out: Blues from the Backroads, for which Shepherd received two more Grammy nominations. In the documentary, he and his band traveled throughout the American South to record with such blues icons as B.B. King, Clarence \u201cGatemouth\u201d Brown, Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins and David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards. 2010 saw the release of Shepherd\u2019s long-awaited first live album, Live! In Chicago, recorded at Chicago\u2019s House of Blues during the all-star Legends tour supporting 10 Days Out. The live disc debuted at #1 on Billboard\u2019s Blues chart, marking the 5th time he had a #1 debut as well as receiving yet another Grammy nomination. In 2011, the now seasoned performer and songwriter stopped off to release the acclaimed How I Go and in 2013, Shepherd became one-third of blues-rock supergroup The Rides, with legendary veterans Stephen Stills (Crosby, Stills & Nash) and Barry Goldberg (Electric Flag). The Rides toured extensively, and have released two acclaimed albums, Can't Get Enough and Pierced Arrow, that further illuminate Shepherd\u2019s depth and proficiency as a songwriter, guitar player and now vocalist. In 2014, the rocket-fueled collaboration covers album, Goin\u2019 Home was introduced and 2017 saw the release of Lay It On Down which was followed by 2019\u2019s The Traveler, which reaches across the battle lines of a planet that has never been so divided and showcases Shepherd\u2019s ever-evolving songwriting. The Traveler also marked the 8th time Shepherd had a release debut at #1 on the Billboard Blues charts. In an industry that's changed drastically over the years, Shepherd\u2019s versatility and drive has served him well.

Having needed at least three years to get the grips of being a soloist, plus developing a knack for song writing and grooming that distinctive, vocal styling it wasn't until May 1981 that Carlos really took the fraternity by storm, courtesy of a heavy, roots and culture flavored show case album titled Suffering for Negus Roots. Since then working alongside Goldie, his side kick, co writer and back up vocalist having built and consolidated a staunch following through touring the live circuit, plus 12 solo albums, most notably Harvest Time, Day to Day Living, Them Never Know a Natty Dread have credentials all three issued in 1982, Spread Out 1982 also otherwise known as Laser Beam to which the majority of tracks in this set have been culled, Never Run Away 1984, Just a Passing Glance 1985 and more recently Seven Days a Week a solid joint production venture, between Goldie, Dr. Dread and himself, there has been no turning back.

I knew we had to be killing it, standing in that church rec center in front of all my high school peers at the time. The cymbals sizzling, bass drum pounding, bass guitar rattling your guts. Pure teenage angst, bouncing off the walls, an echoing dance of frequencies. I tried to remember to breath as my fingers in high strung discord slid wildly along the fretboard. It was my first live solo, and it was if just for moment the world had seemed to stop. I wanted the moment to last forever, though merely a brief passing of time. In hindsight, we probably weren\u2019t all I thought we were cracked up to be, but my first guitar solo as a teenager in that church rec center was enough to keep me hooked for life. From early piano lessons, too passing through a variety of school band instruments, music seemed to find a way in one way or another into my life. I can remember the sounds of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens coming through the stereo as kid. As my teenage years hit, music was a way to escape. A way to seem cool and distance myself from all the bullies in school. There was something so freeing about strumming a few power chords until my ear rang at jam sessions after school Eventually my escape became a fascination more intense and artists from the likes of Roy Buchanan, to Pink Floyd, Branford Marsalis, Miles Davis, Trane and Mahivishnu began to infiltrate the tape deck. After leaving home in Charlotte, NC, and heading off to Appalachian State, a new world of tunes found their way into my heart, from the Flecktones, to Acoustic Syndicate, and Leo Kottke. Diving deep into jazz and theory classes, while playing in jam bands, my tastes evolved, and while I knew I loved jazz, I truly found joy in blending a variety of music, and melding styles from the likes of jazz, funk, blues, americana, rock, soul, and bluegrass. In the twenty plus year that I\u2019ve performed professionally, I\u2019ve had the good fortune and honor of being able to share the stage with a variety of top notch performers. My family has made their home outside of Denver, CO, and you can usually find me performing in venues from coffee shops to concert halls. While I frequent a variety of different types of venues, my intention remains true to be a genuine as possible in what I do and never forget that you never can tell who is listening. These days you\u2019ll find me performing an eclectic mix of covers and originals as a solo artist, or on a stage with one of the bands or artists that I\u2019m happy to share the stage with.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "14697 Delaware St, Westminster, CO 80023", "Artist": "Thumpin' ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8601198.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.9624712, -104.9917447], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Funk, R&b, Soul, Dance Bands", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "The Orchard Town Center", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102801944-thumpin'-at-the-orchard-town-center?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "In just over six years, Thumpin' has become one of the most popular bands on the Denver music scene, drawing enthusiastic crowds and amassing a loyal following who love what this band does: providing its audiences with music that moves the body and soul, music with maximum groove.

It's a sonic aesthetic that instantly incites movement and has established him as a trailblazer in the electronic dance music world. That perspective also set the stage for his forthcoming full-length debut available on Ultra Music in 2014. At 14-years-old, the multi-instrumentalist discovered progressive house music, and his life completely changed with the purchase of a synthesizer. His hobby became a profession shortly thereafter. Lake soon went from releasing much talked-about remixes to dropping dance floor bangers. \"Changes\" broke the Top 10 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2006, while \"Carry Me Away\" [featuring Emma Hewitt] dominated the same chart a year later. He followed those two early successes up with the Top 10 singles \"Only One\" and \"If You Knew\", effectively breaking into the North American market. Performing for packed audiences across the globe, Ultra Music signed him in 2012, and he went to collaborate with the likes of Lazy Rich on \"Stand Alone\" featuring Jareth and Steve Aoki and Tujamo on the 2013 hit \"Boneless\". Meanwhile, \"Helium\" another collaboration with Jareth and wife, Gita Lake, effortlessly transcended aural boundaries with its ethereal electronic hum, guitar twang, and unshakable refrain. After three years, he perfected the track. Then, there's the single \"Squeak\", which encapsulates his enigmatic style and embraces that classic spirit tighter. It fuses funk, electro, melodies, and breakdowns into a \"groovy\" hybrid evocative of Lake's singular sound. As a result, the best way to meet Lake is to fall into his body of work. Like all timeless music, it's meant to be an escape transcending eras, scenes, and ages.", "otherInfo": "Chris Lake b2b FISHER @ Denver Coliseum"}, {"Address": "4600 Humboldt St, Denver, CO 80216", "Artist": "Follow The Fish ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8987240.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.779002, -104.9702685], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Tech House, House", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Under Construction: Denver", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102700835-follow-the-fish-at-denver-coliseum?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "N+S America Bookings: Cody Chapman CChapman@paradigmagency.com Aus+NZ Bookings: Stuart Balfour stuart@posterchild.com.au", "otherInfo": "FISHER b2b Chris Lake @ Denver Coliseum"}, {"Address": "4586 Tennyson St, Denver, CO 80212", "Artist": "Leor Manelis ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11596544.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7799045, -105.0437552], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "6:30 PM", "Venue": "Local 46", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102788306-leor-manelis-at-local-46?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "Robby Peoples Band"}, {"Address": "930 Lincoln St, Denver, CO 80203", "Artist": "Christian Sands ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11597287.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7309888, -104.9859727], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz, Blues, Latin", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Christian Sands Trio", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102788736-christian-sands-at-dazzle-jazz?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Christian Sands\u2019 third recording for Mack Avenue Music Group captures and establishes him as a forceful leader in composition and conceptual vision.

Taking their cue from thrashers such as Exodus and Megadeth, as well as NWOBHM legends like Judas Priest and Mot\u00f6rhead, Immortal S\u00ffnn creates a perfect mixture of speed and grit, but can also knock you out with mid-tempo riffs from hell. Immortal S\u00ffnn was formed in 2004 by guitarist and sole original member Tony Z. After constant line-up changes and poorly-recorded demos, Tony decided to put the band on hiatus after joining Denver rock band, Phoenix Rising (later called Wild Angelz and, finally, Devoutcast), in May 2007. Tony revived Immortal S\u00ffnn in July 2012 with the looming collapse of Devoutcast. He recruited Devoutcast singer Alex Giebler to record the band\u2019s first single, \u201cWhiskey\u201d, in March 2013. It was an instant hit on online radio shows such as The Friday Night Feature, and received airplay on terrestrial stations such as KILO 94.3 in Colorado Springs as well as KRCX 93.9 and 107X in Denver. A completely new line-up emerged in 2015 when the band released their first EP, Barfly, with new singer, Chase McClellan. The EP contained the aforementioned single, \u201cWhiskey\u201d, as well as their first recorded cover, Pantera\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d. The next year, a minor success came for the band when they released their cover of The Chainsmoker\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down\u201d on youtube and itunes. August 2017 saw the band\u2019s first full-length album, Machine Men, which departs from the group's early hard rock style and delves more into the territory of thrash and traditional metal. That month also saw an explosion of recognition for the band after founder and guitarist, Tony Z, was featured prominently in many local, national, and international news outlets while he attended the Taylor Swift trial in Denver, CO. Immortal S\u00ffnn\u2019s goal is to bring metal to the masses, and to show the world that the sounds of yesteryear are still alive and well.", "otherInfo": "(Hard Rock NIGHT at The Goose with some of Denver's favorite Original bands)\n\n1.

The result is a perfect blend of modern hard rock with a touch of old school flare that will turn the heads of generations of rock fans.

Among its members are multi-platinum selling solo artists, multi-platinum record producers, Grammy winners, TV and film stars, screenwriters, product spokespersons, business owners and, most recently, major motion picture composers. The Clan featured nine MCs until the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard in 2004. One of the most critically and commercially successful hip hop groups of all time, Wu-Tang Clan shot to fame through their uncompromising brand of hardcore rap music. Since their debut, they have introduced or launched the careers of numerous other artists and groups, and already in 1994 there were credited to be over 300 Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, consisting of rappers, producers, and record label CEOs. The founders of the Wu-Tang Clan were RZA, GZA, and Ol' Dirty Bastard, who had previously formed the group Force of the Imperial Master (later known as All in Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name). The group attracted the attention of some notable figures in the industry, including Biz Markie, but did not manage to secure a record deal. After the crew dissolved, GZA (then known as The Genius) and The RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem) embarked on their solo careers with Cold Chillin' Records and Tommy Bricks Records respectively, but to little success. Their frustration with the workings of the hip hop music industry would provide the main inspiration to Wu-Tang Clan's revolutionary business plan. According to The Wu-Tang Manual, at the group's inception, RZA promised the members that if he had total control of the Wu-Tang empire, it would conquer the hip-hop world within a dynastic cycle, after which he would relinquish his total control. Wu-Tang Clan was gradually assembled in late 1992 from friends and accomplices from around Staten Island, New York, with The RZA as the de facto leader and the group's producer. Two of the cousins, GZA (pronounced Jizza) and The RZA (pronounced Rizza), created their new Wu-Tang aliases by mimicking the sound that the words \"genius\" and \"razor\" would make when scratched on a turntable. \"Wu-Tang\" comes from the name of the Taoist holy mountain Wu Dang in northwest Hubei Province in central China; it was also the site of the Ming Dynasty Purple Imperial City built during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. The RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after seeing the Kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang, which features a school of warriors trained in Wu-Tang style. The group's debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections and using dialogue excerpts as skits. The group have also developed various backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers like KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including \"We Usually Take All the Niggas' Garments,\" \"Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game\" and \"Wisdom, Universe, Truth, Allah, Nation, and God\". Method Man has also mentioned that the \"Wu\" is the sound a sword makes when cutting through the air, and \"Tang\" is the sound it makes against a shield. The Clan first became known to hip hop fans, and to major record labels, in 1993 (see 1993 in music) following the release of the independent single \"Protect Ya Neck\", which immediately gave the group a sizeable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in late 1993. This album was popular and critically-acclaimed, though it took some time to gain momentum. Though hip hop had long had a gritty texture, the surreal aggression and minimalist production of 36 Chambers nevertheless had a huge impact on the genre, and was to prove massively influential over the next decade. By the beginning of the 21st century, the album had become a regular fixture on \"Best Albums Of The 90s\" lists as well as a frequent choice for \"Best Albums Of All Time\" lists. The success of Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers established the group as a creative and influential force in early 1990s hip hop, allowing GZA, The RZA, Raekwon,Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Ol' Dirty Bastard to negotiate solo contracts.", "otherInfo": "Wu-Tang Clan with Colorado Symphony"}, {"Address": "18300 W Alameda Pkwy, Morrison, CO 80465", "Artist": "Jeff Nisen ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7991595.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.6664666, -105.2048546], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Red Rocks Amphitheater (w/ Pepper)", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102750024-jeff-nisen-at-red-rocks-amphitheatre?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Jeff Nisen is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, beer drinker, and international sex symbol with a keen knack for over-exaggeration. He began writing his own biography about one sentence ago, and now, after careful consideration, feels confident that he can fill you in on all his relevant life details. Jeff's musical journey began when he first heard the sweet sounds of anarchy resonating through the guitars of 90's punk rock bands. With a cheap guitar in hand and a voracious appetite to rock, he eventually worked his way into grunge, and then what can only be considered to be a heavy metal obsession. Soon going from Tony Iommi, to Randy Rhoads, to Eddie Van Halen... It seemed the shredding could know no bounds, but then there was a softer side that began to exude from a more delicate corner of his soul. It wasn't long before the sweet sounds of James Taylor, The Eagles, Crosby Stills & Nash and many other 70's greats began to dominate his musical expression. Finally, to complete the musical picture, a friend gave him a Stevie Ray Vaughan album and he found himself completely enamored with the blues. After bouncing around garage bands throughout his teenage years in Southern California, and slowly finding some confidence in his voice, he felt it was time to start a serious band to record an album and hit the road. Enter Sand Section, a three piece band that he started with his long time friends and musical counterparts Tony Gonella (Bass, Vocals) and Sam Mandelbaum (Drums). Their reggae/rock/surf influences coupled with an emphasis on soaring vocal harmonies were encapsulated in their 2010 debut album Truth Over Harmony, which can be heard in its entirety in the \"MUSIC\" tab. After two more releases with Sand Section and several tours, the group finally disbanded in 2013 and Jeff switched his focus back to his hard rock roots. Enter Lose Control, a hard rock band that has spent the last few years touring and releasing two albums that are both available to stream in the MUSIC tab. Lose Control is currently hard at work recording a new album and have recently shared the stage with Puddle of Mudd, Pennywise, Pepper, Unwritten Law, and Death By Stereo (check out www.LoseControlRock.com for more details). Aside from Lose Control, Jeff is also working on a solo album as well as playing tirelessly in and around his hometown of Hermosa Beach, California. You can find him often as a solo act with an acoustic guitar, or playing guitar across the country with countless other bands including Bret Bollinger, Tomorrows Bad Seeds, and Cheers to Nothing. On top of playing gigs, he is also always hard at work in the studio writing and recording songs for one of his projects or for licensing, as well as wearing a production hat, having worked on Pepper's 2016 album, Ohana, (www.pepperlive.com) and a 2013 release with Mikey Cote (www.MikeyCote.com).

After high school, he decided to follow his dream to Nashville where he met his bandmates. Blane has been touring the midwest, mid plains, and southern regions of the country for the past several years making a name for himself in the music industry. At the age of 3, Blane stood in front of the TV with a blue and green plastic guitar and sang along with Alan Jackson's, \"Chasin' That Neon Rainbow.\" He dreamed of one day growing up to be a country singer just like Alan Jackson. Twenty plus years later, he is chasing that dream he had as a kid. Blane was highly influenced by the 90s greats like Jackson, Brooks and Dunn, and Randy Travis. Today he is heavily influenced by the styles of Blake Shelton, Dierks Bentley, and Brothers Osborne. All of these influences have made an impact on Blane's unique style of country, modern-traditional, mixing the authenticity of the 90's with the contemporary edge of today! Blane has had the privilege of opening up shows for country greats like Blake Shelton, Joe Nichols, Trace Adkins, Rodney Atkins, Hunter Hays, Granger Smith, Travis Tritt, Charlie Daniels Band, and others. Blane has played the Arkansas State Fair, Nashville's Next Big Twang, multiple shows at CMA Fest, spent two years on the Chevy MainStage at the State Fair of Texas, an eight day residency on the Dr. Pepper Stage at the State Fair of Texas, the South Carolina Peach Festival, and many other fairs, festivals, and corporate and private events across the country. \u2018Bout Time' is the title track to Blane's original EP which was released in January of 2013; he followed that up in 2014 with a two-song CD of \"Arkansas, Y'all. In 2015 he release his first full album, \"Away We Go,\" which has many great singles including \"Friday Feeling,\" and \"Crazy,\" as well as the title track. Blane was married in fall of 2016 and as a gift for his bride-to-be, he wrote \"Promise To Love Her.\" After a short video clip from their wedding of the couple dancing to the song took off on social media, he decided that maybe he should record the song. In March of 2017 the single released to national radio and it made its way to #33 on the Music Row Breakout Chart, holding there for three weeks.

But they got to wondering what would happen if they tried to merge the music of these two bands, the Granddaddies and Daddies of the jamband scene. While these two bands have their surface similarities, most fans realize that their actual musical styles are quite different. The Grateful Dead are an earthy, folky, bluesy band where Phish is sharper around the edges\u2013funky and more aggressive. But both bands have an improvisational approach to their live shows, and it is in that spontaneity where the magic really happens. The guys in DPO have posed themselves a unique challenge in merging the two styles. Set lists end up with segues that look like Divided Sky > Morning Dew > Divided Sky, or Help > Slip > Frankenstein. Or how about Mike\u2019s Song > Stella Blue > Weekapaug Groove. Or even stranger, like My Friend, My Friend of the Devil\u2026or It Must Have Been The Roses Are Free.

Now with his sixth album, the Mississippi-bred singer/guitarist merges his distinct sensibilities into a stripped-down, roots-oriented sound that starkly showcases the gritty elegance of his songwriting. The follow-up to 2014\u2019s critically praised Daylight/Dark\u2014an album that \u201cbelongs on a shelf next to Dwight Yoakam\u2019s Buenos Noches from a Lonely Room, Joe Ely\u2019s Letter to Laredo, and yes, even Willie Nelson\u2019s Phases and Stages,\u201d according to AllMusic\u2014Eady\u2019s latest finds the Fort Worth, Texas-based artist again teaming up with producer Kevin Welch. Now longtime collaborators (with their past efforts including 2012\u2019s AM Country Heaven, a top 40 debut on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart), Eady and Welch worked closely in crafting the album\u2019s acoustic-driven yet lushly textured aesthetic. \u201cAt the beginning I told everyone I wanted to make a record where, if the power went out, we could still sit down and play all the songs the exact same way,\u201d says Eady, who points out that steel guitar is the only electric instrument featured on the album. Despite its subtle approach, the album radiates a warm vitality that\u2019s got much to do with Eady\u2019s gift for nuanced yet unaffected slice-of-life storytelling. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to writing that\u2019s got a simplicity to it, where you\u2019re digging deep into real day-to-day life,\u201d he notes. Here, that means touching on such matters as turning 40 (on the reflective, soul-stirring \u201c40 Years\u201d), his daughter\u2019s growing up and going off to college (on the sweetly heartbreaking \u201cNot Too Loud\u201d), and the everyday struggle to \u201cembrace the messy parts of life instead of trying to get the point where you\u2019ve somehow fixed all your problems\u201d (on \u201cRain,\u201d a joyfully determined anthem featuring SteelDrivers fiddler Tammy Rogers). Throughout the album, Eady\u2019s soulfully rugged voice blends in beautiful harmonies with his wife, singer/songwriter Courtney Patton. And on \u201cNo Genie in This Bottle,\u201d the legendary Vince Gill lends his singular vocals to what Eady refers to as a \u201cgood old country drinking song.\u201d In each track, Eady reveals a sharp sense of songcraft he\u2019s honed since childhood. \u201cEven back in my early days of getting into music, I always cared more about the writers than the singers,\u201d says Eady, who grew up in Jackson. \u201cI\u2019d look up who\u2019d written a certain song, and then go seek out more songs from that writer.\u201d At age 14\u2014the same year he started writing his own material\u2014Eady began performing in local bars and showing his natural grasp of everything from soul and R&B to blues and country. After some time in the Air Force, he moved to Fort Worth and started playing open mic nights, where he quickly built up a devoted following. By 2005, Eady had made his debut with the independently released From Underneath The Old. For Eady\u2014who names Merle Haggard, Guy Clark, and Willie Nelson among his main inspirations\u2014instilling each song with so much graceful honesty proved to be his greatest achievement and thrill in creating the new album. \u201cWhen you first get started making music, your ideas are grandiose and more about the big picture. But the longer I\u2019ve done this, the more I\u2019ve realized that the real joy comes from the process rather than the end goal,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s about getting better and finding more of myself with every album. So instead of writing what I think people want to hear, I\u2019m writing what I want to write and trusting that\u2014as long as it\u2019s coming from an honest place\u2014it\u2019ll hopefully mean something to the people listening too.\u201d", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "640 Main St, Louisville, CO 80027", "Artist": "The Custom Shop-Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11106574.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.9766071, -105.1318801], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues Rock, R&b, Motown, Rock", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "the Custom Shop - Band @ Louisville Underground", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102733649-the-custom-shop-band-at-louisville-underground?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "The Custom Shop, from metro Denver north, CO, is a variety band that plays the rock, R&B and Motown as well as its edgier original take in those genres.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3602 E Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80206", "Artist": "Tonguebyte ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [39.7399564, -104.944749], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Lost Lake Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022399056-tonguebyte-at-lost-lake-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "10133 W Chatfield Ave, Littleton, CO 80127", "Artist": "The Boys Are Back ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [39.5699202, -105.1121455], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Q's Pub and Grill", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022586936-the-boys-are-back-at-q's-pub-and-grill?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3560 Chestnut Pl, Denver, CO 80216", "Artist": "KDJabove HQ ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8705875.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7722073, -104.9793189], "Date": "2021-08-14", "EventDate": "Aug. 14th, 2021", "Genre": "Jazz Soul & Funk, Hip Hop, House, Dub", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Number Thirty Eight", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102806874-kdjabove-hq-at-number-thirty-eight?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "KDJ Above is a groundbreaking music performer straight out of Denver.

For us, the songs are personal but not necessarily autobiographical, yet we must connect with the songs in a real way so there may be some truth in the music we make. With diverse influences, we mix rock, country, folk, blues, and singer-songwriter musical styles to create a hybrid roots-rock Americana sound all our own. The mission is simple, be authentic to who we are and entertaining to the audience in the process.

Raised in Washington DC, his music career took flight after moving to Brooklyn, NY. In 15 years of touring, he has built a devout following, performing at sold out theatres and ballrooms across the country. Over time, Cope\u2019s music has become the soundtrack to the lives of those who have embraced it and he continues to inspire audiences through what can only be described as a deep personal connection. His first album in seven years, Heroin and Helicopters tackles Cope\u2019s personal struggles with institutional religion, political manipulation, hollowness in the entertainment world, and spiritual enlightenment. It\u2019s named after an encounter with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll icon Santana: one evening at the Fillmore in San Francisco, Santana told him to \u201cstay away from the two H\u2019s\u201d - heroin and helicopters - both things having very fatal results with people in music. Cope saw meaning in the comment, reflected in the current epidemic of addictions that plague our world, not just to substances but to conflict, handheld devices, social media, and the lure of not having to work hard to get places fast. He observed a thread being woven, where mass production has trumped quality goods and shortcuts in life have become commonplace, enticing people to step over others for self-enrichment. Where entitlement and greed have become the norm as empathy and awareness of the human condition become an afterthought, the common man has lost his powerful voice to corporations. It\u2019s less a condemnation of others and more an acknowledgement of the part played by himself and the system that we are all forced to participate in- and the hope that we can do better. http://www.citizencope.com.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3602 E Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80206", "Artist": "The Nova Kicks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10047920.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7399564, -104.944749], "Date": "2021-08-15", "EventDate": "Aug. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "Punk", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Lost Lake Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022398879-the-nova-kicks-at-lost-lake-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "The Nova Kicks are a destructive sound wave of distorted grooves and soul, flying through the vastness of space into the hearts of many.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3602 E Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80206", "Artist": "Hit The Bricks ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/174510.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7399564, -104.944749], "Date": "2021-08-15", "EventDate": "Aug. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Lost Lake Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022421934-hit-the-bricks-at-lost-lake-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "3602 E Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80206", "Artist": "Slap Happy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/6059903.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7399564, -104.944749], "Date": "2021-08-15", "EventDate": "Aug. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Pop", "Time": "4:00 PM", "Venue": "Lost Lake Lounge", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1022399063-slap-happy-at-lost-lake-lounge?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Chicago-based Top40 Pop/Rock cover band for the dazed, punch-drunk and happy-go lucky. www.slaphappychicago.com.

It\u2019s a mantra of sorts for the multi-faceted sextet from Hermosa Beach, driving a relentless thirst for live performances and an ever-evolving cache of original material dotted with influences of blues, ska, rock, world, soul, and punk. Now in 2021, with a fifth studio set, Good Times (Roll On), Fortunate Youth is hoping to rekindle the spirit of those halcyon days, grillin\u2019 and chillin\u2019, and to reunite, once again, with their fans worldwide. It was first on SoCal Little League fields that the core of the group bonded as friends and brothers before forming the band as twenty-somethings in the summer of 2009. Out of the ashes of local favorites Rude Boy Roots and Irie State of Mind, Fortunate Youth emerged, graduating from house parties to prized area clubs; and sneaking underage band members into South Bay bars to play their ambitious sets. They developed an instantly magnetic repertoire around inspired nascent originals and covers of Sublime and Bob Marley, and expanded their circle of fans with early runs in the Golden State and to neighboring Arizona. They became devoted to performing live, ticking off countless miles in the van crisscrossing the U.S., and logging two years of roadwork before recording their first album. They played to small but passionate crowds, slept on floors, and earned particularly rabid responses in Florida and the cannabis-friendly ski towns of Colorado. And true to their egalitarian ethos of brotherhood, even swapped spots onstage, rotating instruments to best fit the performance. As their popularity increased, so did their schedule, with F.Y. supporting brethren such as Slightly Stoopid, Stick Figure, and SOJA on major tours as well as continuing to headline national treks of their own; totaling over 27 tours since their inception. Including the forthcoming Good Times, Fortunate Youth has also catalogued over a dozen releases- ten LPs and EPs, studio and live combined, and several singles- since their 2011 debut, Irie State of Mind; notably, all have been recorded, produced, and distributed, in DIY style, by the self-invested band. After Irie peaked at #2, their next next three studio sets- 2013\u2019s It\u2019s All a Jam; 2015\u2019s Don\u2019t Think Twice; 2017\u2019s Fortunate Youth- each hit #1 on Billboard and ITunes Reggae charts, and landed in the Top 25 of several others. 2017\u2019s self-titled effort, in particular, remained in the Top 10 for five weeks, reaching #9 on iTunes Overall chart. Now, with the glistening title track, \u201cGood Times (Roll On),\u201d as the album\u2019s lead single, Fortunate Youth turns a slightly nostalgic eye to its humble beginnings in the backyard, plus a few new tasty surprises under the lid. Also, there\u2019s a wish: that the return of those feel-good vibes finds brighter days for the planet. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to change the world through the music we write and play, and the lives we live out performing onstage,\u201d says singer Dan Kelly. \u201cWe always hope our music can change the outlook of anyone\u2019s day.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Slightly Stoopid 8/15"}, {"Address": "Evergreen, CO", "Artist": "Olivia Harms ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11258183.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.6333213, -105.3172146], "Date": "2021-08-15", "EventDate": "Aug. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "Traditional Country, Honky Tonk, Texas Country, Bakersfield Sound, Country Western, Country, Outlaw Country", "Time": "5:00 PM", "Venue": "Private Fundraiser", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102680589-olivia-harms-at-private-fundraiser?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Born and raised in Canby, OR and daughter of Western Music Hall of Fame singer/songwriter Joni Harms.

During the long uneasy months of the Covid inflicted 2020, the main men of SFD, Michael and Jaboo, took a long hard look at themselves, what they have accomplished and where they stood in the grand scheme and realized that not only are they outcasts in the rock world but that they\u2019re happy to accept that role as their own. The result is 9 new tracks that come from a place of \u201cFuck It, If You Don\u2019t Care then We Don\u2019t Care and We\u2019ll Just Do What We Do\u201d for the Unwanted, the Uninvited, the Leftout, the Forgotten, the Outcasts and the Damned. Born in 2012, Sunflower Dead released its self-titled debut album through their own Bloody Bats Records with production by Christian Olde Wolbers (Fear Factory). The album received positive press & numerous accolades, including being named Revolver Magazine\u2019s \"Album of the Week\". The band spent the next 2 years on the road promoting the LP, including tours with In This Moment, All That Remains, Hellyeah, Nonpoint, Powerman 5000, Hed (PE), Ill Nino, Soil, Smile Empty Soul and Hurt. The debut album moved over 6,000 units and helped establish a loyal Fanbase dubbed \u2018The Evil Seeds.\u2019 Touring and experiencing what worked in a live setting helped mature the band's songwriting skills that they brought with them into the studio while recording their 2nd full-length LP, \"It\u2019s Time to Get Weird\" with producer Dave Fortman (Evanescence, Slipknot) and Mikey Doling (Snot). The album showcased a more polished sound while incorporating a more playful side that live audiences were just beginning to get a taste of. The \u2018Weird\u2019 album was a step forward on multiple fronts - from the production team, to a slicker stage look and photos with famed rock photographer Neil Zlozower, and guest vocals on the album\u2019s title track by Korn\u2019s Jonathan Davis. Lead single, \"Dance with Death\" was the band\u2019s first foray into Active Rock radio and reached #52 on the Mediabase Active Rock charts just as the album was released on October 30, 2015 independently, again through their own Bloody Bat Records. The title cut \"It\u2019s Time to Get Weird (featuring Korn\u2019s Jonathan Davis),\u201d was released in early 2016, becoming the band\u2019s first Top 40 hit on the Mediabase Active Rock chart. With the success of both singles, Sunflower Dead supported the album on the road from mid 2015 through 2017 with Korn, Snot, Avatar, Hellyeah, both legs of In This Moment\u2019s \u2018Hellpop\u2019 tour and direct support on two runs with Mushroomhead. In 2018, the band returned to the studio with producer Dave Fortman with the desire to strip away the bullshit and write a record that expressed their rawness and building discontent of being dismissed. The result was their third album \"C O M A\" released on Oct. 19th, 2018 through David Ellefson\u2019s (Megadeth) EMP Label Group. \u201cC O M A\u201d contained SFD\u2019s most aggressive and lyrically heartfelt songs to date including their 2 highest charting Top 40 Active Rocks Hits \u201cVictim\u201d (#36 on both Monitored Charts) and \u201cTurn Away\u201d (#37 on both Monitored Charts). With the new more serious tone of \u201cC O M A\u201c, affectionately dubbed \u201cThe Christopher Nolan Record \u201c, by the band, SFD eagerly hit the road in late 2018 on their own 25 Date US Warm Up Tour. The success of that tour was followed up with 6 week theater tour in Summer/Fall of 2019 supporting Scott Stapp (Creed) that put the band in front of a completely new audience gaining them an entire other set of Evils Seeds that had yet to be exposed to the band. The band continued supporting the album on the road from February through March of 2020 supporting Sons Of Texas. Due to the Pandemic and subsequent shutdown, all remaining touring for 2020 had been cancelled and SFD quickly switched gears back to writing and recording their newly finished and set for release 3/4/2022 ode to the unwanted album, \u201cMarch Of The Leper with tour dates already booked for August of 2021.

The pair met while attending Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee as songwriting majors. Not long after meeting they began writing songs together as a creative outlet outside of their personal endeavours. Armould comes from an Americana background. After spending time as the front man for the indie folk band Halleway in Denver, Colorado he quickly began to learn the ropes of what it was like to be a touring musician as a teenager. The band toured with acts like Houndmouth, Joe Pug, and The Ballroom Thieves. When the band disbanded in 2019, Armould channeled his energy to a solo project he named American Field Day. While touring with American Field Day, he has also made records with the likes of producers such as Bill Reynolds (Band of Horses) and Mike Marsh (The Avett Brothers). He has shared the stage with bands such as: Illiterate Light, Joe Pug, and Strand of Oaks. Not long after his pursuit started with American Field Day, he moved to Nashville to study at Lipscomb and further his career. It was there he met Grace Russell. Grace Russell was born and raised in one of the most profound music cities in the world, New Orleans. Driven by the energy of her hometown, she gravitated towards music from a young age. As she excelled in writing music, she began to make a name for herself as an up and coming songwriter within the New Orleans music scene. Once she was a young teenager, she was called to grow in her work in Nashville, Tennessee. At age 17, Russell left her small town behind and dove into Music City. Working as a songwriter under many different mentorships, she honed her craft to form a sound that is uniquely and undeniably Grace Russell. Russell toured throughout the southeast as a solo artist under her own name, growing her audience wherever she went. In the summer of 2020, her songs began to bend closer to being labeled as \u201cfolk rock songs\u201d as she discovered softer melodies that hovered beside an acoustic guitar. This came just in time for the fall when she met Patrick Armould when the duo began writing songs for what eventually became Hello Darling. Hello Darling prides itself on its heartfelt lyrics and unmistakable live performances. When they sit down to write songs, the goal is to create music that was just as effective to the listener as it is to the band personally. The music walks the stylistic lines of indie folk and Americana, driving comparison to The Head and the Heart and The Avett Brothers. They are currently in the process of cutting their debut record with producer Daniel Nelson at La Blanca Studios in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hello Darling is joined by drummer Riley O\u2019donnell.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "1578 S Broadway, Denver, CO 80210", "Artist": "Sami Chohfi ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11511485.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.6878673, -104.9872152], "Date": "2021-08-15", "EventDate": "Aug. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "Acoustic Rock, Alternative, Folk Rock", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Herman's Hideaway", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/102742976-sami-chohfi-at-herman's-hideaway?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "While Singer/songwriter Sami Chohfi is based in Seattle, he is undeniably a modern citizen of the world.

POP EVIL smashes through the odds like a battering ram, weathering the trials and tribulations of paying dues with a steadfast resilience owing much to their blue collar and middle class backgrounds, and building a worldwide audience one fan at a time. As the moniker promises when emblazoned on a CD or radio dial, POP EVIL conjures aggressive riffs and hard charging sing-a-longs with emotional heft and melodic power in equal measure. It\u2019s music by the people, for the people. There\u2019s a reason Billboard named POP EVIL the #4 Mainstream Rock Artist of 2014, and it\u2019s not just because of those three(!) consecutive #1 Rock Radio Singles from the last album (and a fourth that cracked the Top 10), the Top 10 Independent debut and Top 40 Billboard 200 debut of ONYX, or that album\u2019s subsequent 180,000 in domestic sales. All of which being undoubtedly rare feats to accomplish as independent artists in any genre of music. Simply put, POP EVIL is a larger-than-life true rock n\u2019 roll band blending the earnestness of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden with the celebratory showmanship of Motley Crue and KISS, capable of empathizing with the daily struggles of their fans while simultaneously offering the escapism a truly bombastic concert provides. It\u2019s an attitude and a way of life POP EVIL has put proudly on display on tour with Godsmack (as part of Rockstar Uproar), Five Finger Death Punch, Three Doors Down, Papa Roach, Stone Sour, Three Days Grace, Theory Of A Deadman, Black Stone Cherry and more. Purposefully assembled at Studio Litho and London Bridge Studios with producer Adam Kasper (Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Foo Fighters), UP is the sound of a rock band cementing a powerful identity that\u2019s steadily materialized over the course of three prior full-length slabs. The inspirational soon to be live staple \u201cFootsteps,\u201d the swaggering \u201cTake It All\u201d \u2013 POP EVIL prove their burgeoning success is no accident. \u201cThere were many more highs than lows in the wake of ONYX,\u201d summarizes band frontman LEIGH KAKATY. \u201cThe only real low was that it was hard to be gone from our families for another year. But the highs were amazing. We experienced our first #1 record with \u2018Trenches,\u2019 followed by \u2018Deal with the Devil,\u2019 and then again with \u2018Torn to Pieces,\u2019 which was a song about my father, who passed in 2011. Having that song go to #1 was a nice tribute to my pops, and closure for my personal journey.\u201d \u201cThen came \u2018Beautiful.\u2019 Having four singles at radio from any album these days is a huge honor itself. We were just grateful. It humbled us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe tasted the fruits from all of the previous years, from when we felt like nobody was listening.\u201d After a self-released record and EP kicked up a buzz, the first proper POP EVIL album, Lipstick on the Mirror found its way to listeners via a major label re-release, despite the business trouble that resulted in Pop Evil tearing up their major label contract on stage, in what Spin Magazine called one of the Ten Best Moments of Rock on the Range. The band\u2019s pristine follow-up, War of Angels, brought Pop Evil to a worldwide audience, driven by the strength of radio ready tracks \u201cLast Man Standing,\u201d \u201cMonster You Made,\u201d and the Mick Mars collaboration, \u201cBoss\u2019s Daughter.\u201d Produced by Johnny K (Disturbed, 3 Doors Down, Megadeth), ONYX represented a bold new creative achievement, and provided several career milestones, including a triumphant return to Rock On The Range where the band played \u201cTrenches\u201d with Rock and Roll Hall Of Famer Darryl \u201cD.M.C.\u201d McDaniels as 13 U.S. Marines (showcasing the Lima Company Eyes of Freedom Memorial) stood behind them. \u201cPeople ask me all the time, \u2018What it's like to hear your song on the radio?\u2019 It never gets old!\u201d Kakaty declares. \u201cIt's a reminder of hard work, and of having that dream sitting in your garage, trying to write a song that someone would love one day. That dream happened for our band and it's something that we don't want to take lightly. \u201cNow it's time to step up our game and let people know we can back it all up,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe want to prove we aren\u2019t a one hit wonder. We didn\u2019t just get lucky.\u201d UP is a bold reintroduction and step forward, with guitarists NICK FUELLING and DAVEY GRAHS, bassist MATT DIRITO and Kakaty at the top of their game. It\u2019s always a bit clich\u00e9, not to mention questionable, when a band says their new album is the best one yet. But in the case of POP EVIL, it\u2019s an absolute fact. \u201cWhen I listen rock radio today, I think, \u2018Where\u2019s the fun?\u2019\u201d Kakaty explains. \u201cWhere\u2019s that release that gets people away from their everyday stress? The more we toured on ONYX, we realized we wanted more of that element in our set. \u2018Some songs have a lot of discipline, anger and angst to it, which is one side of the band. It\u2019s do or die. Other songs deal with temptations, or loss. ONYX came from a dark place, so with this album, UP, we wanted to remind ourselves to have fun, too. That attitude has led to a rebirth, a growth we haven\u2019t seen before. We\u2019re excited about it.\u201d POP EVIL sees each of their records as a time capsule, a testament to who they were and where they were at in their lives when they made it. Having conquered Rock Radio with three consecutive number one singles on the last album, the question became, \u201cWhere to from here?\u201d They\u2019ve been careful not to repeat themselves. The band constantly pushes forward, evolves, experiments and adapts, while staying true to their core. It\u2019s with this attitude that POP EVIL succeeded in building a lasting bond with their fans. It\u2019s the type of environment created by the groups who listeners treat like family, and the bands celebrate the same way in return. Fans bring bands into their lives, they make the songs a part of them. Music doesn\u2019t belong solely to the songwriters who create it. It\u2019s a shared experience, a community possession, the moment it\u2019s unleashed across the airwaves and strikes a chord with someone else. It\u2019s why powerhouse sports teams like the Anaheim Ducks, New Jersey Devils, Boston Bruins, and the band\u2019s very own Detroit Red Wings, Tigers and Michigan Wolverines bang their anthems over the loudspeakers. POP EVIL\u2019s music brings people together, energizing listeners with power; on the radio, on ESPN, FOX, ABC, and anywhere. POP EVIL won\u2019t criticize the wide variety of tools at the disposal of artists these days, finding nothing inherently wrong with programming, loops, samples, or studio enhancements. Nevertheless, POP EVIL champions the special magic found when a rock n\u2019 roll band strips it back down to drums, bass, guitars and a microphone. \u201cOne of my greatest accomplishments in life was learning how to play that guitar,\u201d says Kakaty. \u201cAt first, it\u2019s intimidating. You don\u2019t even want to touch that thing! But once you learn, anytime you walk by one, you\u2019re like, \u2018Give me that damn thing.\u2019 It\u2019s a gift.\u201d That spirit, that motivation, that nearly indescribable feeling that unites people across cultural, economic, religious, and all other divides \u2013 it\u2019s Zeppelin. It\u2019s Sabbath. It\u2019s Aerosmith. It\u2019s James Brown. It\u2019s Woodstock. It\u2019s transcendent purity.

A year later, he joined Pompeii 99 formed by band leader, lead vocalist and guitarist \"Valor\". Pompeii 99 was another L.A. band enjoying local success which was in negotiations with European labels and promoters to bring Pompeii 99 to Europe. French label \"L'invitation Au Suicide\" suggested that as Rozz was new in the band, he preferred them to reuse the name Christian Death. Rozz did not like the idea as he wanted a fresh start from what he considered bad memories, Valor was reluctant to give up the work put into Pompeii 99. However, they both considered the alternatives and along with the promise to record and tour in Europe, they accepted, Thus began a new incarnation of Christian Death. The first internationally released album \"Catastrophe Ballet\" was recorded in the UK, then began the first European tour. Returning to L.A., work began on the next album \"Ashes\" as well as the release of live tapes. Plans for a follow-up European tour were underway when just weeks before the tour, once again, Rozz announced he needed a change due to his emotional issues, he wanted to disband, this time, however, the band was now an equal partnership under multiple agreements. After 3 years of hard-earned success, Valor and the other band members pleaded for him, not to give up. Despite these pleas, Rozz threw in the towel.With no intention of canceling the tour, Valor moved to lead vocal, the bass player became the guitar player, the guitar roadie became the bass player, so off they went to Europe without him. With Valor now as frontman, the band relocated to London. From there, through a relentless campaign of single and album releases, several of which were top 10 indie hits enjoying exposure on the BBC, MTV and other European radio and television stations, meanwhile using the UK as a base to constantly tour Europe, here began the rise to international iconic status. By the early 90s, everyone with their finger on the pulse of innovation in rock music had heard of Christian Death. News of this success had filtered back to the USA which encouraged people with influence, to incite Rozz, years after splitting the band, to illegitimately do some shows and recordings under the name which resulted in a legal dispute. Rozz was, however, unable to substantiate any claims of ownership as he had previously relinquished those rights years before, on the other hand, out of respect, Valor agreed to allow Rozz to continue to sell the few recordings made and misrepresented as Christian Death on the condition that no further records were made as such. Rozz moved on to other art and spoken word projects. Enter \"Maitri\", female vocalist and bass player, the second most continuous member of Christian Death. Maitri originally from Holland, after attending music college, moved to London where she first met the band. Her first official debut as a permanent member was on the album \"Sexy Death God\". She has been a key figure in the band ever since. Sadly on 4/1/1998, with a history of alcohol and drug abuse and attempted suicides (since the first tour), rozz hung himself. With a propensity for innovation and sometimes outrageous art, concepts, and lyrics, the band has become an inspiration to a huge swath of bands and artists, including seemingly incompatible bands, most notably, Korn, Type O Negative and Cradle of Filth (as publicly stated). Christian Death has continued to tour 5 of the seven continents and released a staggering 17 studio albums and 2 live albums worth of music, unofficial and bootlegs not included, (discography attached). The band continues the tradition in 2017 while promoting the current album The Root Of All Evilutionan while also with a new album in the works and an upcoming US tour with Lords of Acid and Combichrist. The founding fathers of American goth rock, Christian Death took a relentlessly confrontational stand against organized religion and conventional morality, with an appetite for provocation that made Marilyn Manson look like Stryper. Regardless of who was leading or performing in the group, Christian Death set themselves up to shock, both in their cover art and their lyrics, which wallowed in blasphemy, morbidity, drug use, and sexual perversity. Their self-consciously controversial tactics set them apart from the British goth scene, having more to do with L.A. punk and heavy metal, and thus the band dubbed its sound \"death rock\" instead; however, their sensibility was ultimately similar enough that the \"goth\" designation stuck in the end. - Steve Huey Rolling Stone One of the top ten Goth bands of all time - Rolling Stone Official CHRISTIAN DEATH discography The studio albums: Only Theatre of Pain Catastrophe ballet Ashes The Wind Kissed Pictures Atrocities The Scriptures Sex and Drugs and Jesus Christ All the Love All the Hate, part 1 All the Love All the Love All the Hate, part 2 All the Hate Insanus Ultio Proditio Misericordiaque Jesus Points the Bone at You Prophecies Sexy Death God Pornographic Messiah Born Again anti Christian American Inquisition The Root of All Evilution The live albums: The Heretics Alive Amen Decomposition of Violets ( original tape and CD only)", "otherInfo": "Live Performance!"}, {"Address": "7401 E 1st Ave, Denver, CO 80230", "Artist": "Lee Dewyze ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11228857.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7189393, -104.9011535], "Date": "2021-08-15", "EventDate": "Aug. 15th, 2021", "Genre": "Indie", "Time": "8:00 PM", "Venue": "Soiled Dove Underground", "currentUrl": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1021475595-lee-dewyze-at-soiled-dove-underground?came_from=257&utm_medium=web&utm_source=home&utm_campaign=event", "moreBioInfo": "Ghost Stories Tour 2021 !

Red Scare was a female fronted 1980's California goth-punk band. They produced a self-titled album, 2 demos (a CD was recently released, as well, called \"As Promised\" also a Posh Boy reissue that contains both demo and LP tracks \"Street Life\".) and played lots of gigs in the early 1980's. Bobbi was well-known on the scene in the late seventies/early eighties and was highly respected. Sadly, she died of cancer when she was only 26, and the group disbanded after that. 2. The Red Scare is a screamo band in the same vein as Hassan I Sabbah, Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse etc. They are most well known for a Split 7\" with one of Screamo's must popular bands, Orchid.", "otherInfo": "Sunnnner Album Release Show!!\nw/ The Red Scare, King Crawdad, and Rose Variety!\nSunday August 15th \n21+ Doors at 7 PM"}]
