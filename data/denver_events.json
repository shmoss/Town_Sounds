Soulful is the word\"-- Wall Street Journal \"Washburn stomped and skipped through fiery Appalachian takes on the local songs of Sichuan. Her bilingualism's no gimmick; she nails the dips and peaks of pitch while leading her band in scorching variations on simple, repetitive traditional melodies\u2026\u201d \u2013 L.A. Times \u201c{Abigail Washburn is} an artist who best embodies the notion of Americana as a worldwide musical language\" \u2013 The Tennessean Beijing. A smoke-filled club bustling with people, clanging of bottles, chatter. There is a woman on stage with her banjo. She begins to sing old-time Appalachian music in Chinese. The effect produced is entirely original, a cultural mash-up between two distant yet not so different worlds. The crowd quiets down to listen. Abigail Washburn never set out to be a songwriter, recording artist or a producer. Her performance at that smoke-filled Beijing club would prove to be an important step toward international acclaim and attention from discerning critics. Abigail has created a new sound \u2013 a sound that challenges traditional notions of culture and countries. Abigail planned to move to China after a road trip up the east coast, but instead she stumbled upon a professional music career. This east coast trip included a stop at the International Bluegrass Music Association conference in Louisville, KY where she intended to learn a few banjo tunes but walked away with a demo session for a record deal in Nashville, TN. She canceled her one-way ticket to China and moved to Nashville. Shortly thereafter in 2004 she joined Uncle Earl. The \"all G'earl\" group released two records on the Rounder label, She Waits for Night (2005) and Waterloo, TN, (2007) the latter of which was produced by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. In the midst of touring with Uncle Earl, Washburn released her first solo debut, and bilingual album, Song of the Traveling Daughter, (Nettwerk). At that point, Abigail joined cellist, Ben Sollee, in performing her music around the globe. In 2005 Abigail, Ben and a few talented friends (B\u00e9la Fleck on banjo and Casey Driessen on fiddle) formed the Sparrow Quartet and toured China. In 2006, the US State Department and the American Center for Educational Exchange requested that the group come back to lead the first official tour of a US band in Tibet. In May 2008, the Sparrow Quartet released Abigail Washburn & the Sparrow Quartet (Nettwerk) which was praised by critics and appeared on several \u201cbest of\u201d lists from prominent publications. Produced by B\u00e9la Fleck and composed/arranged by the unconventional foursome, Abigail Washburn & The Sparrow Quartet became an \"intimate exploration of crossing global and cultural lines,\" says Abigail, who feels a reverence for both American and Chinese cultures. The unprecedented combination of two banjos (clawhammer and three-finger-style), cello and five-string fiddle unfolds -live and on record- in a dreamlike chamber suite. From the flawless \u2018Overture\" and harrowing revival, \"Strange Things,\" to the interplanetary, Puccini-inspired old-time fairy tale, \"Great Big Wall in China,\" this record highlights the brilliant musicianship of each individual, but is at the same time much larger than the sum of its parts. In 2008 and 2009, Abigail Washburn and the Sparrow Quartet toured extensively throughout the US and Canada with appearances at festivals including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage, Merlefest, Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Vancouver Folk Festival and many more. They were invited by the US State Department to play in China including several performances in Beijing during the 2008 Olympic games. In addition, the were filmed on National Geographic Live in Washington, DC and were invited to be a part of the Clearwater Concert, a benefit concert in celebration of Pete Seeger's 90th birthday along with a line-up of some of the most prominent, established musicians in the world. For Abigail and the Sparrow Quartet, 2008 was a year full of accomplishments and successes. But Abigail does not stop. She is a force of nature that continually attracts others to become a part of her art. Enter The Shanghai Restoration Project (SRP) producer Dave Liang. Abigail and Dave first collaborated to produce two electronic remixes of Sparrow Quartet songs released in April 2009. In December 2008, Abigail served as a resident teacher at the Sichuan University Art School teaching traditional US music. In the hours after school was finished, she volunteered for Sichuan Quake Relief performing at earthquake relocation schools. The experience with the students and teachers after the performances left her wanting to do something to help. In early March, 2009, Abigail had the idea to create Afterquake, a benefit EP in memory of the May 12, 2008 Sichuan Earthquake which left more than 5 million people homeless and hundreds of thousands dead. Abigail and The Shanghai Restoration Project united again to go to Sichuan Province, to the relocation schools and into the disaster zone to capture the voices of those affected by the earthquake and sample sounds from the schools and the disaster zone. They sampled, recorded and produced Afterquake in two and a half weeks in Sichuan province. The final result is a beautiful, timeless, intelligent and accessible musical document that blends folk and electronic sounds with post-earthquake samples. A portion of all proceeds will go to the Sichuan Quake Relief organization. Whether playing her banjo, or producing an electronic album, there is an undeniable element of Abigail Washburn in every project she embraces. Abigail's spirit and philosophy translate from language to language and bind countries, cultures and genres. \"As more and more people engage in this struggle for a new direction for the human spirit, we'll recognize that we're morphing into a global species.\" ---Abigail Washburn", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "15200 W. 6th Ave Frontage Rd., Golden, CO 80401", "Artist": "Luis Alfonso Partida El YAKI ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [39.7217606, -105.1705332], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Jefferson County Fairgrounds", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "500 W Main St, Lyons, CO 80540", "Artist": "Michael Cleveland & Flamekeeper ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/10390406.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.226863, -105.2733015], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk, Americana, Bluegrass", "Time": "12:45 PM", "Venue": "RockyGrass", "moreBioInfo": "Michael Cleveland Bio Award-winning fiddler Michael Cleveland brings dynamic traditional bluegrass to the stage with his award-winning band, Flamekeeper, in a show that will leave the audience talking. A 2020 GRAMMY winner and 12-time winner of the International Bluegrass Music Association's Fiddle Performer of the Year award, Mike and his talented band present a program of tight vocal trios and duos, blistering instrumentals, and fiddle-and-banjo duets that echo the first-generation stars of bluegrass. The show is rounded out with Mike's dry wit and the band's sense of fun. Considered one of the premier bluegrass fiddlers of his generation, Mike picked up a fiddle at age four, and his talent was recognized early. In 1993 he was chosen to be part of the Bluegrass Youth All Stars. Later that year Mike made his Grand Ole Opry debut as a guest of Alison Krauss. His list of guest appearances over the years is a who's who of bluegrass legends including Bill Monroe, Jim and Jesse, and Ralph Stanley. After high school Mike toured with Dale Ann Bradley and Coon Creek before joining Rhonda Vincent and The Rage in 2000. At the 2001 IBMA awards, Mike took his first Fiddle Performer of the Year award, and shared the title of Entertainer of the Year with Rhonda Vincent and the Rage. In 2002 Mike rejoined The Dale Ann Bradley Band. That year he won the Fiddle Performer of the Year award and again in 2004. Since 2006, Mike has swept the Fiddle Performer of the Year award, and now has 12 to his credit. Mike's first solo project as a Rounder recording artist, Flame Keeper, was re-leased in February 2002 and was chosen the IBMA's Instrumental Album of the Year. In 2004, Mike shared the Instrumental Album of the Year award with Tom Adams for Tom Adams and Michael Cleveland Live at the Ragged Edge, an album of fiddle and banjo duets. That was followed in 2006 by a second solo project, the award-winning Let 'Er Go, Boys! and in 2008 by the first Michael Cleveland and Flamekeeper CD, Leavin' Town. The band\u2019s second CD, Fired Up, was released in March 2011 and reached #1 on Sirius XM Bluegrass Junction\u2019s Most Played Albums chart.

Up until this point music had been a hobby fueled by cobbling together tracks on his \"sixty buck keyboard, a cheap four-track and a cheap drum machine\" while still an undergraduate at the University of Illinois. This DIY method of production was never taken seriously and when childhood plans to become a doctor were shelved Jones was firmly committed to a career as a chemical engineer, His dad was an occasional DJ and eventually became budding musician. As time went on Jones discovered what was his innate love and understanding for house music, a sound that had grown throughout the mid-80s out of Chicago's deep-rooted disco scene. As a child he was into sci-fi movies and time travel TV shows like Doctor Who and would spend hours pondering over the possibilities this would open up. He played the saxophone at school and had a talent for trying to play with a keyboard but remained largely un-interested in what he saw as his father's passion. It was this cut-up, tacky, production style of the early house sound that Jones absorbed and translated into the 'Underground Goodies EP', his first release as Cajmere (that's CAJ as in Curtis A. Jones) put out in 1991 on his own recently started Cajual label. A year later he had his first massive hit as Cajmere with the brilliant house tune 'Coffeepot (It's Time For The Percolator)' also out on Cajual. He then teamed up with Chicago-based vocalist Dajae for 'Brighter Days' (he entered #2 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play), a high impact, more mellow house tune that came out on Emotive. from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Velvet", "otherInfo": "VIP -Separate expedited festival entry on the south side of the festival.

The support bleeds deep; it is a special moment when world icon DJ Snake looks over to his peer Diplo and states that 4B is \u201cthe next big thing with the hottest s**t in the streets.\u201d In 2015, 4B created \u201cPop Dat,\u201d with Aazar, the booty-shaking banger that would become his trademark single; the track became one of the most played songs of 2016 and topped over 9 million streams, putting 4B firmly on the map as one to be watched in the dance music scene. In addition to his original productions, 4B\u2019s penchant for forward-thinking production style translates into winning remixes; he has put his signature touch on the likes of Fetty Wap\u2019s \u201cMy Way\u201d with Flosstradamus and DJ Snake\u2019s \u201cMiddle,\u201d earning 6 and 8 million total streams respectively.

All of those pale in comparison to his wildly popular set at EDC Las Vegas right before ZEDD, where he brought out Soulja Boy as a special guest. Most recently he embarked on the BLACKOUT tour with Flosstradamus, following their release of the track of the same name on Ultra Records, hitting major cities across the US and Canada this summer.

Previous releases include Still Country, Still King: A Tribute to George Jones (September 2018), his first full-length original album Relapse (May 2017), and an EP Honky Tonk Land (June 2014). In 2015, James left a technician job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and returned to his native state of Tennessee to pursue a country music career. George Jones' own widow, Nancy, personally hired James for his first steady gig at the George Jones Museum in Nashville, allowing him to make a living playing music and to hone his hobby-turned-profession in an accelerated fashion. Since then, James has played several shows each week in downtown Nashville at places like The George Jones and AJ's Good Time Bar when he's not on the road, having played over 1500 public, corporate, and private events since January 2015. In addition to supporting his young family and connecting with other musicians and songwriters, performing downtown has helped James build a large fan base of folks drawn through the doors by the booming voice echoing down Broadway and 2nd Avenue. Playing so many shows in a relatively short time-frame in a city with an excess of raw talent forced him to sharpen his stage show quickly and continue to refine the thing he's always enjoyed most \u2014 entertaining and interacting with his audiences in a way that leaves most people feeling like they've made a new friend. James was the 2018 WSM Road Show Winner, resulting in the opportunity to make his Grand Ole Opry debut opening for Alan Jackson at the Ryman Auditorium on January 17, 2020. He was also selected by Jackson from the crop of rising artists who play at AJ\u2019s Good Time Bar, Jackson\u2019s self-owned honky-tonk on downtown Nashville\u2019s famed \u201cLower Broadway,\u201d to open select dates on Jackson\u2019s 2019 \u201cHonky Tonk Highway\u201d tour.

Like those that came before, Tenth Mountain Division is pushing the sound found in the mountains into bold, new directions with their exploratory take on Americana that dips freely in the well of all their diverse influences, classic Southern Rock, the progressive bluegrass that was born in their backyard in Colorado, the adventurous spirit of sixties psychedelic blues, and straight ahead driving rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Much like their Colorado predecessors, Leftover Salmon, String Cheese Incident, and Yonder Mountain String Band, they defy simple categorization; instead they reference their musical history with their high-energy shows as they blaze new musical paths every night. As they do so they have become the new voice of the Colorado music scene, taking their Ski-party sound around the country and making every show feel like a night in the mountains. Tenth Mountain Division was first born in 2010 when high-school classmates, Winston Heuga (mandolin) and MJ Ouimette (guitar) first met when they discovered a shared musical interest. The two young musicians started penning songs together that were inspired by the lore of the 10th Mountain Division military infantry and the natural beauty that surrounded their hometown in the Rocky Mountains. They ended up at the University Colorado Boulder where they briefly played as an acoustic trio with upright bassist, Connor Dunn before meeting drummer Tyler Gwynn and keyboardist Campbell Thomas. The addition of drums and keys to Heuga and Ouimette\u2019s deep musical bond, widened their musical palette, taking the band in new directions and pointing to bold, uncharted, musical horizons. They released their first album, Cracks in the Sky, in 2016 and followed it up with a national tour that saw them packing shows across the country. The band\u2019s lineup was solidified soon after with the addition of Andrew Cooney and immediate success followed. Since then they have become a regular presence on the festival circuit including stops at Summer Camp, Aiken Bluegrass Festival, Winter Wondergrass, Yarmony, ARISE, and Leftover Salmon\u2019s Boogie at the Broadmoor. They released their second album, In Good Company, in 2018.

Inspired by a background in classical percussion and an obsession with synthesizers, Malvin creates dazed, melodic beat-centric tunes that loosely hang between down-tempo head nodders and up-tempo club bangers. FADER has described his music as \u2018form-shifting beats [that] seem to resonate with spaced-out chillers and hyperactive party kids alike\u2019. In 2012, while on Warped Tour as the drummer for Stepdad, Malvin released the slow burning, bass heavy single \u201cMarijuana\u201d on a Bandcamp compilation highlighting music from he and his friends in Ann Arbor. It quickly rocketed to #1 on Hype Machine and has since become an internet-stoner anthem. It has subsequently been rereleased by Future Classic and Kitsun\u00e9. Malvin's next EP, 'Parallelism', will be released with Future Classic on 11/13. It was made using three synthesizers, vocal samples from friends, and a tambourine.", "otherInfo": "STS9 7/24"}, {"Address": "321 Mountain Ave, Berthoud, CO 80513", "Artist": "Taylor Shae ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11225976.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.3048654, -105.0789858], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Blue-eyed Soul, Americana, Acoustic, Acoustic Blues", "Time": "6:00 PM", "Venue": "Taylor Shae Duo LIVE at City Star Brewing", "moreBioInfo": "Taylor Shae is an award-winning singer-songwriter born and raised in Colorado, credited for her carefree edge, old-soul lyrics, and velvety-toned vocals.

Guns, and Dangerous Toys. The name Faster Pussycat was taken from a 1965 film called \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" The name was originally meant for Tracii Guns' new band after leaving Guns N' Roses. After getting financial backing if he used the L.A. Guns name again, Tracii's friend Taime Downe took the name and formed Faster Pussycat with lead guitarist Brent Muscat, the only member to perform on all Faster Pussycat releases besides Taime. They released their self titled debut in 1987, as well as their follow up \"Wake Me When It's Over\" in 1989, during the last years of glam metal's commercial viability. They reached their commercial plateau with their hit ballad \"House of Pain\" off of their second album, which managed to go gold. With the rise of grunge in the early 90's, Faster Pussycat's style of music fell out of favor, despite having little in common with the chart topping glam bands at the time, such as Warrant and Slaughter. They released their third album \"Whipped!\" to little success in 1992. Sensing the change in musicial tastes, they disbanded and went on to various other projects, with frontman Taime Downe going onto form an industrial rock band called Newlydeads. In 2001, Taime released \"Between the Valley of the Ultra Pussy\" with some former members of Faster Pussycat under the moniker, which contained newer versions of older songs. The band has since reformed and has recorded a new album, \"The Power and the Gloryhole,\" which was released in 2006.

In a few short years, throngs of \"Shakeheads\" could be found on the highways and byways of the Rocky Mountains, making their way to another Shakedown Street show. In the live music venues of the Rocky Mountains, there are only a few bands that are able to consistantly draw large audiences. Shakedown Street accomplishes this year after year by embodying the Grateful Dead ethos of improvisation and discovery, while maintaining an intimacy and open repoire with its audience. A whole new generation of \"Shakeheads\" has discovered the positive and collaborative energy found at a Shakedown Street concert. Longtime fans are thrilled to find the band sounding hotter than ever, and having the time of their lives!

Taking their cue from thrashers such as Exodus and Megadeth, as well as NWOBHM legends like Judas Priest and Mot\u00f6rhead, Immortal S\u00ffnn creates a perfect mixture of speed and grit, but can also knock you out with mid-tempo riffs from hell. Immortal S\u00ffnn was formed in 2004 by guitarist and sole original member Tony Z. After constant line-up changes and poorly-recorded demos, Tony decided to put the band on hiatus after joining Denver rock band, Phoenix Rising (later called Wild Angelz and, finally, Devoutcast), in May 2007. Tony revived Immortal S\u00ffnn in July 2012 with the looming collapse of Devoutcast. He recruited Devoutcast singer Alex Giebler to record the band\u2019s first single, \u201cWhiskey\u201d, in March 2013. It was an instant hit on online radio shows such as The Friday Night Feature, and received airplay on terrestrial stations such as KILO 94.3 in Colorado Springs as well as KRCX 93.9 and 107X in Denver. A completely new line-up emerged in 2015 when the band released their first EP, Barfly, with new singer, Chase McClellan. The EP contained the aforementioned single, \u201cWhiskey\u201d, as well as their first recorded cover, Pantera\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d.

Together, they keep shattering misconceptions country folks have about punk rockers and vice versa.\" -Bobby More // Stomp and Stammer \"Jenny Don't and The Spurs are a fantastic independent country and western quartet who sing heart wrenching songs about emotional turmoil wit passion and honesty. The quartet's albums will make classic country western fans extremely proud.\" - Jersey Beat Since their inception in 2012, the Spurs have kept a relentless schedule of recording, playing locally, and touring. After nearly 500 live appearances in almost a dozen countries, and with a slew of albums and singles to their name, Jenny Don\u2019t And The Spurs are just getting warmed up. The Spurs were founded one cold, winter\u2019s evening by Jenny and Kelly. Jenny had been fronting her own band, DON\u2019T, for some time, as well as playing the occasional solo acoustic set here and there. Kelly, who had been in a slew of Portland punk bands since the 80\u2019s, and who had spent the previous several years balancing a grueling touring schedule playing drums with the garage rock trio PIERCED ARROWS and bass with Portland punk-rock destroyers P.R.O.B.L.E.M.S., and wanted to switch gears a bit. After the concept of forming a raw, real, and back-to-the-roots country band had taken hold, it wasn\u2019t long before the couple was rehearsing a seminal set of standards by such influential early country crooners and outlaws like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Ernest Tubb, and Hank Sr., as well as a sprinkling of originals. It was only a few weeks later that Kelly\u2019s bandmates Fred and Toody Cole got wind of the developing musical project that was taking form in Jenny and Kelly\u2019s kitchen and decided to call their bluff by giving them an unsolicited support slot on an upcoming show featuring the Cole\u2019s own solo two-piece act. Not having anticipated such a high-profile live appearance as a first live outing, and feeling like the guitar-and-bass-only lineup that the band had started life as was lacking something on the rhythm end of things, they decided to ask their friend Sam Henry to join them on drums. Sam, who in addition to being Jenny\u2019s bandmate in DON\u2019T and sometimes solo-set-collaborator, had already had a long, well respected career as one of Portland\u2019s best drummers, having played with such first-generation punk bands as the Wipers, The Rats and Napalm Beach. After a couple of weeks of practice, the debut live appearance of the band went off without a hitch and the core lineup of Jenny Don\u2019t And The Spurs was born. The trio of Jenny, Kelly, and Sam existed in this form for the first year-an-a-half or so of the band\u2019s existence, playing whatever local venue would take them \u2013 bars, clubs, porches, basements, backyards, and even a bookstore. This worked well for a while, and occasionally the Spurs would enlist talent from a pool of several friends to sit in on lead guitar or lap steel. The addition of a second guitar rounded out the sound of the band to the point where Jenny and Co. decided to make it a permanent part of the band\u2019s lineup. After a couple of false starts and a bit of difficulty finding a fourth member who could commit to the Spur\u2019s sometimes grueling touring schedule, the incredible Christopher March became a member of the family in early 2017.

He is most well known for his work with the band B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones, which he has described as \"a mixture of acoustic and electronic music with a lot of roots in folk and bluegrass as well as funk and jazz.\" Fleck, who is named after famous Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, was drawn to the banjo when he first heard Earl Scruggs play the theme song for the television show Beverly Hillbillies. He received his first banjo at age fifteen from his grandfather (1973). Later, Fleck would enroll in New York City's High School of Music and Art where he studied French horn. Almost immediately after high school, Fleck traveled to Boston to play with Jack Tottle and Mark Schatz in Tasty Licks. It is with Tasty Licks that Fleck played on his first major album. During this period, Fleck released his first solo album (1979) \"Crossing the Tracks\". It was Fleck's first foray into progressive bluegrass composition. Fleck would play on the streets of Boston with bassist Mark Schatz until the two formed Spectrum: the Band in 1981. Fleck toured with Spectrum until 1981. That year, Fleck was asked by Sam Bush and company to join New Grass Revival. Fleck performed with New Grass Revival for nine years. During this time, Fleck recorded another solo album, \"Drive.\" It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the then first-time category of Best Bluegrass Album (1988). After a 1988 phone call with bassist Victor Wooten, Fleck and Wooten formed B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones, rounded out with harmonica player Howard Levy and Wooten's percussionist brother Roy \"Future Man\" Wooten, who plays synthesizer-based percussion. Saxophonist Jeff Coffin joined the group with the album \"Left of Cool\". With the Flecktones, Fleck has been nominated for and won several Grammy awards. Fleck has shared Grammy wins with Asleep at the Wheel, Alison Brown, and Edgar Meyer. He has been nominated in more categories than any other musician, namely country, pop, jazz, bluegrass, classical, folk, and spoken word, as well as composition and arranging.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "124 E 4th St #5502, Loveland, CO 80537", "Artist": "Jay_Martin ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11403490.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.226863, -105.2733015], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Rock, Blues, Pop, Reggae", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Pourhouse", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "7 S Broadway, Denver, CO 80209", "Artist": "Neon  Brown ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [39.716333, -104.9877689], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Hi-Dive", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "The Healing Tree and Hi-Dive presents, Pantones!\nDenver's only all-vinyl, boogie, funk, disco, house, and soul party."}, {"Address": "2009 Larimer St, Denver, CO 80205", "Artist": "Control Freak ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8555172.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.7533249, -104.9925328], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Marquis Theater", "moreBioInfo": "Control Freak is a party rock band from Orlando that knows how to have a good time and makes sure their audience does too.

Randomly. He can\u2019t really tell you why. Maybe it\u2019s that \u201cno-fear-of-the-edge\u201d mentality that hooks the non-country-lovin\u2019 folk while he manages to maintain a balance of traditional vibes that will remind you of a modern day John Wayne. He's a 6\u20194\u201d bass-baritone powerhouse who once hit 200 million television sets worldwide as a contestant on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d With each performance he fights to create something electric, something that grabs you and makes you look up. Maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe that\u2019s why some people don\u2019t like country and yet... they like him. The most common question a singer will be asked is, \u201cWhen did you start singing?\u201d Buckstein has always had the same answer: \u201cWhen I found out that the chicks dig it.\u201d Sounds like a punchline but it\u2019s actually the truth. He was 13, at summer camp, trying to figure out how to meet girls like everyone else. A couple of girls were singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and he shyly scooted up next to them and started singing along. \u201cWhen they found out I could sing they immediately introduced me to all the other girls in the camp,\u201d he grins. \u201cI\u2019ve been singing ever since.\u201d His love of country music is thanks to his father who played it all the time when he was young even though he hated the genre. \u201cIt takes one good country song to hook ya!\u201d Buckstein warns. \u201cMine was probably \u2018Thunder Rolls\u2019 by Garth Brooks or \u2018This Ain\u2019t No Thinking Thing\u2019 by Trace Adkins. I heard those tunes when I was about 11 or 12 and something just clicked\u2014I was hooked.\u201d He continued to grow up a country boy at heart often retreating to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. However, since he always lived in the city, the rest of his musical tastes fall outside of the expected box, running a gamut that includes blues, rock, rap, classics from the \u201950s, and whatever was on Top 40 radio at any given time. Buckstein studied theater in college, earning his BA from California State University, Fullerton. Prior to \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d he had moved to LA to pursue a career as an actor. \u201cBig surprise, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d he confides. \u201cOne day a few friends of mine went to the \u2018American Idol\u2019 auditions, which was the hottest show on TV at the time. They wanted some company so I went along. I got through and they didn\u2019t. It was Idol that set me on a different path.\u201d After appearing on the finale of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d in Season 5, he returned to Denver with music on the brain. He started singing with whomever would back him up, growing along the way, learning his craft, year after year, little by little, making friends, music, mistakes, and big moves, all leading him to today. \u201cThose years were invaluable,\u201d he says. \u201cThey call it \u2018paying your dues.\u2019 It always sounded like a bad thing. But I found out paying your dues can be some of the most fun you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d Over the past few years Buckstein has traveled all over Colorado and the Midwest region performing for soon-to-be-lifelong fans. He admits to laughing to himself when other performers come to Colorado and complain about how hard it is to sing at such a high altitude. Buckstein, being a true native of the 5280 state, has never had a problem. With the help of his band, \u201cThe Heard\u201d (his rotating roster of professionals), he has rocked crowds opening for Charlie Daniels, Dustin Lynch, Old Dominion, Eli Young, John Michael Montgomery, Mark Chesnutt, Vanilla Ice, and many, many others. He\u2019s gained local fame as a regular guest star on Denver\u2019s hottest country station 98.5 KYGO and also as the writer and performer of \u201cThe Grizzly Rose,\u201d which is a popular song about the famous Denver nightclub, and he produced a music video for the track. Buckstein wrote the song about his personal experiences after his first week playing at the legendary venue. He began, as most do, singing covers of all of the artists he was most influenced by. Buckstein embraces covers and thinks that no matter what, \u201cthere should always be room in your set to pay homage to the artists and songs that have touched your life. Even when you\u2019re selling out arenas with your own stuff you can do that. I have a saying: \u2018Today we play the songs that others have written\u2026 so that someday we may play the songs that we have written\u2026 so that someday others may play the songs that we have written.\u2019 You gotta put those pauses in there for dramatic effect,\u201d he laughs. Buckstein is currently embarking on his next chapter with his newest EP, Country Side. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of heart in these five tunes,\u201d Buckstein says. \u201cMaking them has been a very valuable experience. It has shown me not only where I am but where I want to go from here.\u201d Buckstein\u2019s goal is to bring soul to everything he does. \u201cWhat people seem to respond most to in my live performances is my passion, so I worked hard to bring that passion to the record. My sound gets compared a lot to the great bass-baritones of my time: Trace Adkins, Toby Keith, Josh Turner, and Chris Young. But I personally hate comparisons. I don\u2019t think Josh Turner wants to hear he sounds like Don Williams,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI just wanna sound like me. If my sound were a drink, I'd like to think it would come in a bottle with a cork instead of a twist cap. And I'd like to say it's got a crisp bite with a smooth finish.\u201d He gives all the thanks in the world to his fans and his crew: \u201cWithout the people who support me, on stage and off, this would all be for nothing. I try to always surround myself with good people who want to make good music for other good people.\u201d And if you\u2019re still wondering, it\u2019s pronounced \u201cBuck-steen.\u201d www.bucksteinmusic.com", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2637 Welton St, Denver, CO 80205", "Artist": "Of the Trees ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11565133.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.75453640000001, -104.9788397], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic, Ambient, Other, Trip Hop, Dubstep", "Time": "9:00 PM", "Venue": "Official Global Dance After Party feat.

El nombre TIERRA CALI lo adoptan por el orgullo de sus ra\u00edces calentanas ya que hacen referencia a su querida \u201cTierra Caliente\u201d conformada por una parte de Michoac\u00e1n y Guerrero.

Buscando oportunidades e iniciando sus presentaciones en lugares cercanos a Michoac\u00e1n, fue hasta el 2001 cuando ingresan a la compa\u00f1\u00eda disquera, Discos Cuidad, sello con el que realizan siete producciones discogr\u00e1ficas. Fue con temas como \u201cLa Milpa\u201d, \u201cEl Pescado nadador\u201d y \u201cNo pares no\u2026\u201d que TIERRA CALI se empez\u00f3 a dar a conocer en su estado; pero cuando hay calidad se traspasan fronteras, logrando su consagraci\u00f3n a nivel nacional e internacional, convirti\u00e9ndose en uno de los m\u00e1ximos y m\u00e1s reconocidos exponentes de la m\u00fasica grupera logrando colocar sus temas en los primeros lugares de popularidad en la radio de M\u00e9xico y E.U.A. y entre los que se encuentran \u201cAmor te amo\u201d, \u201cLloraras\u201d y \u201cVuelve conmigo\u201d, de la inspiraci\u00f3n de Humberto Plancarte. Aunque ya el grupo era reconocido, fue en el 2005 cuando TIERRA CALI alcanz\u00f3 un gran \u00e9xito con su \u00e1lbum \u201cAmor te amo\u201d, el cual los llev\u00f3 a ser nominados al premio Billboard de la M\u00fasica Latina en la categor\u00eda de Mejor \u00c1lbum Regional Mexicano del A\u00f1o Nueva Generaci\u00f3n. En el 2006 nuevamente Billboard los nomin\u00f3 como \u201cMejor Agrupaci\u00f3n Nueva\u201d del g\u00e9nero regional mexicano por el material \u201cAmor te amo\u201d con el que vendieron m\u00e1s de 200 mil discos, con el cual adem\u00e1s se hicieron acreedores a un Disco de Platino y permaneciendo desde entonces en todos en los charts radiales. Para el 2007, ya en pleno crecimiento musical, TIERRA CALI lanza a la venta uno de sus discos m\u00e1s exitosos en su corta pero fruct\u00edfera carrera, \u201cEnamorado de ti\u201d del que se desprenden los sencillos \u201cDonde quiera que est\u00e9s\u201d y \u201cEnamorado de ti\u201d con los cuales lograron el reconocimiento de la industria musical. Con \u201cEnamorado de ti\u201d, su quinto \u00e1lbum, les dio la continuidad necesaria para seguir en el gusto de la gente habiendo estado en las listas de Billboard y Monitor Latino dentro de los Hot Latin Tracks m\u00e1s sonados del 2007 con tres de sus temas (\u201cDonde quiera que est\u00e9s\u201d, \u201cEnamorado de ti\u201d, y \u201cLloraras\u201d). Lo cual, tambi\u00e9n les permiti\u00f3 hacer una extensa gira promocional y de conciertos durante las cuales visitaron las ciudades m\u00e1s importantes de EE.UU., cosechando \u00e9xitos en taquilla y a nivel radial. En el a\u00f1o 2008, TIERRA CALI logra consolidar su carrera al posicionar tres de sus discos entre los Top 100 en la lista de ventas de Soundscan y el Hot Latin Albums de la revista Billboard, consiguiendo as\u00ed lo que muy pocos artistas han logrado a lo largo de toda su carrera. En ese momento, su compa\u00f1\u00eda disquera Vene Music, el sello discogr\u00e1fico de Venevision International (una compa\u00f1\u00eda global de entretenimiento de la Organizaci\u00f3n Cisneros), les hicieron entrega de un Disco de Platino por la ventas de \u201cEnamorado de ti\u201d, con el que sobrepasaron las cifra de 100,000 unidades vendidas en EE.UU.; adem\u00e1s de dos Discos de Oro por las ventas obtenidas por el disco \u201cM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la distancia\u201d y la compilaci\u00f3n \u201cGrandes \u00e9xitos de Tierra Cali\u201d. Fue tambi\u00e9n en el 2008 cuando TIERRA CALI logra el premio de \u201cMejor Agrupaci\u00f3n de Tierra Caliente\u201d, otorgado por Los Promotores Unidos USA. En Julio del 2009 hacen el lanzamiento de su s\u00e9ptima producci\u00f3n titulada \u201cSi t\u00fa te vas\u201d, logrando posicionar dentro de los Top 20 de Billboard con el tema hom\u00f3nimo del CD, el cual logra vender m\u00e1s de 60,000 copias, por lo que el grupo se hace acreedor a Disco de Oro y certificaciones de la RIAA por sus altas ventas, lo cual sin duda cada vez es m\u00e1s complicado por la situaci\u00f3n que existe en estos d\u00edas con la industria discogr\u00e1fica y la pirater\u00eda. Para el 2010 TIERRA CALI realiza una exitosa gira por Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico, la cual sirve para promocionar su \u00e1lbum \u201cMaldito amor\u201d del que se desprendi\u00f3 \u201cEn cambio tu\u201d como primer sencillo, y con el que tambi\u00e9n se presentan en los principales programas de radio y televisi\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, resaltando la entrevista que les hicieron en el show de Don Francisco que sali\u00f3 al aire en abril del 2010 y en el que se mostr\u00f3 el lado humano de TIERRA CALI, tocando las fibras sentimentales de todos los televidentes al ver lo dif\u00edcil que ha resultado al grupo llegar hasta donde est\u00e1n hoy. Para TIERRA CALI, \u201cMaldito Amor\u201d fue la octava producci\u00f3n de su carrera, el cual const\u00f3 de 10 temas en el que incorporaron baladas, rancheras, pero sin dejar el corrido y su baile cl\u00e1sico de \u201cEl sacadito\u201d. Nueve de los temas fueron autor\u00eda del mismo Humberto Plancarte y el ritmo y sabor que les imprimen a la m\u00fasica Efra\u00edn, Arcadio, Rafael, Jos\u00e9 Cruz y Armando Farf\u00e1n. \u201cMaldito Amor\u201d debut\u00f3 en su primera semana de lanzamiento en 3er Lugar Nacional de ventas (Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico), manteni\u00e9ndose por varias semanas en los \"Charts de Ventas\" dentro de los top 40 de Soundscan. El primer sencillo en USA titulado al igual que el disco \"Maldito Amor\", se posicion\u00f3 en los top 20 de Billboard dentro de las 4 semanas siguientes a su lanzamiento, permaneciendo en los charts de m\u00fasica hasta finales de julio del 2010; fecha en que se lanz\u00f3 el segundo sencillo \"En cambio Tu\", el cual igualmente se coloc\u00f3 en los top 50. Con una carrera en pleno ascenso, TIERRA CALI lanz\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n en el 2010 un DVD de colecci\u00f3n con el t\u00edtulo \"En Vivo desde la Tierra que los vio nacer\" el cual es un show que realizaron en Las Juntas de Poturo, Michoac\u00e1n, de donde es originario el grupo y en el que el p\u00fablico puede disfrutar y recordar una noche inolvidable en la que TIERRA CALI interpret\u00f3 sus mejores \u00e9xitos entreg\u00e1ndose en cuerpo y alma al p\u00fablico que ese d\u00eda los acompa\u00f1aron. \"En Vivo desde la Tierra que los vio Nacer\" es un DVD de colecci\u00f3n para todos los seguidores de TIERRA CALI, el cual adem\u00e1s inclu\u00eda una novedosa presentaci\u00f3n de su caja, saliendo de los tama\u00f1os que normalmente se manejan en los empaques de este tipo de discos. Un gran logro m\u00e1s en la carrera de TIERRA CALI, fue sin duda en el 2010 su nominaci\u00f3n a \u201cMejor Artista Grupero\u201d en \u201cPremios Lo Nuestro\u201d, terna en la que compitieron con artistas de la talla de Joan Sebastian y Marco Antonio Solis, comprobando el gran momento que ha vivido el grupo y el \u00e9xito que tiene con el p\u00fablico. EL 2011 ES \u201cUN SIGLO DE AMOR\u201d PARA TIERRA CALI Bajo el t\u00edtulo \u201cUn Siglo de Amor\u201d, TIERRA CALI lanz\u00f3 su nuevo disco, el cual es su novena producci\u00f3n y al igual que sus anteriores materiales ha tenido grandes \u00e9xitos al colocarse como el disco m\u00e1s vendido del g\u00e9nero regional mexicano seg\u00fan informaron las listas de Soundscan (el cual es el \u00edndice de Ventas de Nielsen y de Billboard Magazine), adem\u00e1s de que su primer sencillo \"Adi\u00f3s\", se coloc\u00f3 en los primeros lugares de popularidad. No se puede dejar de mencionar que \u201cEn un Siglo de Amor\u201d es notoria la evoluci\u00f3n musical del grupo, pues aunque se conserva ese estilo de \"Tierra Caliente\" y de su tan gustado \"Baile del Sacadito\", se decidieron incluir armon\u00edas e instrumentos vivos como la trompetas, acorde\u00f3n y guitarras (ac\u00fasticas y el\u00e9ctricas) dando un sonido m\u00e1s fresco y abundante que sin duda ha sido del gusto de todos sus seguidores. Como un agradecimiento de los hermanos Plancarte a su p\u00fablico por ese gran apoyo que recibieron con su nuevo disco, que no dudaron en darle un plus al p\u00fablico y hacerlos participes en la selecci\u00f3n del tema que lanzaron como segundo sencillo. Fue as\u00ed que se invit\u00f3 a todos los seguidores que adquirieron el nuevo cd de TIERRA CALI, para que a trav\u00e9s del sitio oficial en Facebook del grupo, los ayudaran a escoger el tema que quer\u00eda escuchar en la radio como segundo corte, resultando el ganador \"400 mil veinte a\u00f1os\" que sin duda fue la canci\u00f3n favorita del p\u00fablico con m\u00e1s del 80% de la votaci\u00f3n. \"400 mil veinte a\u00f1os\", tema autor\u00eda de Humberto Plancarte, l\u00edder y vocalista del grupo y en el cual podemos disfrutar de una gran canci\u00f3n en la que se pide perd\u00f3n por haber fallado y que dice que no le importa llorar 400 mil veinte a\u00f1os con tal de obtener el perd\u00f3n de la mujer a la que se ama, por lo que sin duda se convertir\u00e1 en la consentida de todo el p\u00fablico por ser un tema de despecho que refleja la situaci\u00f3n real de muchas parejas. Hay que mencionar que \u00e9sta es la segunda producci\u00f3n que TIERRA CALI lanza bajo su propio sello discogr\u00e1fico llamado \"Victoria Music\", pues despu\u00e9s del \u00e9xito que obtuvieron con la distribuci\u00f3n y venta de su anterior producci\u00f3n \"Maldito Amor\", decidieron repetir la f\u00f3rmula ahora con \"Un Siglo de Amor\". Una de las caracter\u00edsticas particulares de los hermanos Plancarte es que tienen bien claro que sus canciones son la m\u00e1xima expresi\u00f3n de su compromiso con la m\u00fasica de \u2018Tierra Caliente\u2019, esa m\u00fasica les ha servido a su vez para dar nombre a las ra\u00edces de sus sue\u00f1os. Sus trabajos discogr\u00e1ficos manifiestan el amor de la agrupaci\u00f3n hacia su gente, su cultura y folklore. A pesar de su \u00e9xito actual, el humilde comienzo de los hermanos Plancarte sigue siendo, hoy por hoy, su mejor escuela y su mayor aliciente para continuar su lucha por consagrarse como los preferidos en el gusto de la gente, por esa raz\u00f3n su gira de conciertos semana a semana son un \u00e9xito. Cabe mencionar que TIERRA CALI recientemente recibi\u00f3 un Disco de Oro por m\u00e1s de 50,000!!! copias vendidas, de su m\u00e1s reciente producci\u00f3n algo que sin duda en estos momentos es todo un logro debido a la situaci\u00f3n que la industria musical vive con la pirater\u00eda, pero gracias a la calidad de la m\u00fasica de TIERRA CALI, el p\u00fablico no duda en comprar los discos originales del grupo. A pesar de que la carrera de TIERRA CALI apenas inici\u00f3 en 1998, eso no ha sido impedimento para que el grupo sea ya todo un sin\u00f3nimo de \u00e9xito, pues cada uno de sus discos siempre han recibido por lo menos un disco de oro por sus altas ventas, por lo que en sus 12 a\u00f1os de trayectoria ya tienen m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de discos vendidos!! los cuales se certifican con los reconocimientos de oro y platino que TIERRA CALI ha recibido y que aqu\u00ed se enumeran. \"Alegr\u00eda Calentana\" (2007) - Disco Multiplatino por m\u00e1s de 200,000 copias vendidas. \"Grandes \u00c9xitos\" (2007) - Disco de Oro \"Enamorado de Ti\" (2007) - Disco de Oro por 50,000 copias y Disco de Platino certificado por la RIAA por ventas de m\u00e1s de 100,000 discos en Estados Unidos. \"M\u00e1s All\u00e1 de la Distancia\" (2008) - Disco de Oro \"Si T\u00fa Te Vas\" (2009) - Disco de Oro \"Maldito amor\" (2010) - Disco de Oro No se puede dejar de mencionar que es tal el \u00e9xito que el grupo tiene en la Uni\u00f3n Americana, que mientras algunos grupos se quejan de que no tienen presentaciones, TIERRA CALI consigue abarrotar los lugares donde se presenta e incluso hay ocasiones que hacen hasta 2 shows por noche, esto avalado por el premio PROMUSA que TIERRA CALI recibi\u00f3 como \u201cMejor Grupo en su G\u00e9nero 2009\u201d por Los Promotores Unidos USA certific\u00e1ndolos como uno de los grupos m\u00e1s taquilleros del Momento, lo que los avala por los especialistas como un grupo verdaderamente exitoso. Las producciones de TIERRA CALI son: No pares no\u2026 El Arroyito El Pescador Nadador Alegr\u00eda Calentana 12 Alegres y Calentanos \u00e9xitos Enamorado de Ti Si t\u00fa te Vas Maldito Amor UN SIGLO DE AMOR Adem\u00e1s de 5 DVD en vivo: EN VIVO DESDE EL CARNAVAL DE HOUSTON, TX EN VIVO DESDE LA MONUMENTAL DE MORELIA, MICH.

In summer of 2018, they decided to take a break and consider other pursuits. By late November, they missed each other and their music. It was at this point that they began writing and rehearsing furiously. In January, they spent a week recording their six-song EP, \u201cHOTELS \u00b7 MOTELS \u00b7 HEALTHCARE FACILITIES\u201d in David\u2019s home studio, and spent the next week mixing the project. In February 2019, The Slacks finally released music to the world. The EP was well received within the local music scene, and they began what they hope will be a long journey. Since the release of their debut EP, The Slacks have been playing live shows, writing, and recording relentlessly. Very quickly, they established themselves within the Denver music scene as one of the best live acts, always pushing the limits of what they can do. Since May, the Slacks have had a commitment to release a single a month to push themselves to write more, improve their recording technique, and grow their audience. They look forward to the years ahead, developing both craft and friendship.", "otherInfo": "2:30pm-5:30pm Doors: 2:00pm 21+ Tickets available for purchase at www.yourmomshousedenver.com Artists: Takipnik https://takipnik.com/ Takipnik is an electronic indie synth rock duo based in Denver, Colorado.

Influenced by the vocals of Mariah Carey and Mary J Blige with the guitar styling of James Taylor and John Mayer, Bunny\u2019s genre can be best described as pop/r&b with soulful, finger style guitar. Her name is inspired by The Twilight Zone, mirroring her many dimensions as an artist. One can learn the most about Bunny through her songwriting. Striking a balance between Cutesy and Sexy, Sweet and Sassy, each song expresses a different dimension of femininity. Bunny leaves little to the imagination. Her song \u201c$$$\u201d speaks candidly to the reality of being a full time musician while \u201cPisces\u201d and \u201cDominos\u201d appeal to her more playful side. \u201cGood Intentions\u201d is perhaps her most emotionally honest work about the value of transparency in a relationship. In a past life, Bunny has traveled the world with her music as Lindsey Saunders. From receiving a Gibson Les Paul from a kind stranger at the Pinetop Music festival in Arizona, to meeting one of the infamous members of the Beach Boys in the Airport after playing the Copenhagen Songwriters Festival, she\u2019s always sure to travel with a bit of whimsy in her back pocket. When attending Bunny\u2019s live show, it doesn\u2019t take long to see why she claims it was the guitar that chose her - not the other way around. Bunny\u2019s unconventional chord crafting has earned her a Taylor Guitar Artist Partnership with notable performances at events such as the Sundance Film Festival, Boulder International Film Festival, Durango Songwriters Expo, SXSW and CMJ Music Marathon.

Here, he quotes no less a source than theologian Frederick Buechner: \u201cThe place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world\u2019s deep hunger meet.\u201d \u201cAll Things Possible means something different than when I was first starting out as a musician,\u201d Schultz says. \u201cWhen I first got signed, I thought that if 10 people bought my record, that would be \u2018all things possible.\u2019 But today, using this platform for myself to sell more records is not as inspiring to me. I can only accomplish good things if God is in them, and God shows up. I want to pray those prayers.\u201d As Schultz describes it, the road to All Things Possible began, quite literally, on the road. In 2007, he dipped his toe in the Pacific Ocean and began a punishing 3,500-mile bike ride across the U.S. to raise money for orphans and widows via the James Fund. Here\u2019s how Schultz recalls that bipedal leap of faith that kicked off a 14-date concert tour: \u201cWe took off from the Pacific and I thought, \u2018God is in this.\u2019 Forty miles into it, I\u2019m out of shape, but I\u2019m thinking, \u2018God is still into this.\u2019 And then I got to the first mountain and I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not sure God is into this anymore!\u2019\u201d But if his muscles ached and doubts nagged, Schultz got over it at his first stop, a church outside Palm Springs, Calif. There he played for only 400 people, a modest crowd by Mark Schultz standards. Yet unexpected inspiration carried him up a mountain of another sort. \u201cI did a set list I\u2019d never done before; I told stories I\u2019d never told before,\u201d Schultz says. \u201cThe minister took an offering and afterwards he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re used to, but for his little church, it\u2019s really good.\u2019 They had raised more than $20,000.\u201d While Schultz has always been a powerful encourager through his music, experiences like that took him to new places he wanted to express through new songs. Yet the Colby, Kansas native crafted many compositions for All Things Possible the way he\u2019s always done it\u2013at a chapel piano in Nashville where he\u2019s written since his pre-recording artist days as a youth group leader. \u201cIt\u2019s right around the corner from my house,\u201d Schultz says. \u201cI go to the little chapel where I\u2019ve written almost every one of my songs, and I just repeat a line, and usually tears are running down my face. My best songs are written when I don\u2019t plan them out.\u201d Take \u201cHaven\u2019t Even Met You Yet,\u201d a driving slice of organ-and-piano fueled country rock Schultz crafted for his then-unborn son: \u201cThis is where your story starts/ You\u2019ve already stolen my heart \u2026 I don\u2019t remember life before you at all, and the funny thing is, I haven\u2019t even met you yet.\u201d \u201cI just get tears in my eyes thinking about him,\u201d Schultz says of little Ryan Samuel\u2013and with poignant reason. \u201cI\u2019ve never met my bloodline in this world; it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got my biological mom or my dad. I remember my wife saying, \u2018He looks just like you,\u2019 and I looked in his eyes, and he smiled. My knees just buckled. He\u2019s the first part of me that I\u2019ve ever seen in someone else. I play that in concert and it gets a standing ovation. The thing that\u2019s so exciting for me is that I can\u2019t wait until he gets older, and he can sing his song for his kids.\u201d Yet other songs for \u201cPossible\u201d took flight across the Atlantic, as Schultz and his wife Kate, an OB-GYN, spent a yearlong sabbatical after she completed her medical residency. Take the snappy tune \u201cI Gave Up,\u201d the first one written for the album: \u201cWe\u2019d been in Europe for a while; everything was slower and relationships are pretty prized, while stuff is not prized. And my wife looked at me and said, \u2018Everything we own is in a garage in Nashville. So do you miss anything?\u2019 I said, \u2018No I don\u2019t miss anything.\u2019 And right there was a shift: We have to pay more attention to the relationships, the things that matter, and less to the things that are gong to crumble in time.\u201d When the tune came, Schultz wasted no time catching it, though it took some late-night finesse. \u201cI jumped out of bed and soon I was on the street in Florence, out in the street singing into a recorder at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d Of course, it helps when you\u2019re a songwriter abroad to find a piano, and Schultz (who couldn\u2019t exactly ship one to Europe) found instruments in the most surprising places. \u201cWhen we got to Florence I was climbing the walls. I had to find a piano somewhere. And Kate said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry if we pray about it, we\u2019ll find one.\u2019 So we were eating dinner and there was this very old church across the street, with frescos on the wall.\u201d Schultz went to investigate, and found out that the church not only had a piano, but also was holding a worship service for American college students the next day. The former youth leader stepped up; \u201cI played one song, and then another, and one kid said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re playing an awful lot of Mark Schultz songs.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah, I know.\u2019\u201d Schultz eventually became the church\u2019s temporary worship leader, and grew attendance at the youth service from 5 kids to 30 by the time he left four months later. Another unlikely surprise awaited Schultz in Italy: He found out that his wife qualified for Italian citizenship, since her great-grandfather was an Italian citizen. \u201cSo she got a dual citizenship in Italy, and because I\u2019m married to her, I was able to get one, too. And my kid is an Italian citizen, and he didn\u2019t do any work at all!\u201d Some kids, though, have a lifetime of struggle ahead. Ask Schultz to sum up the album\u2019s theme in one song, and he points to \u201cOne Day,\u201d which got its start while he was on stage singing his hit \u201cI Am.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m looking out in the audience and halfway back, I can see kids in wheelchairs. There\u2019s this one kid in a wheelchair with his fists clenched and his arms thrown up in the air and tears running down his face. And I got choked up. Right at that moment I thought, \u2018Kid you\u2019re going to get your own song.\u2019\u201d The refrain, in typical Schultz fashion, spotlights bigger possibilities and hope beyond human limitations. \u201cOne day we will touch the healer\u2019s hand/ One day we will be whole again.\u201d \u201cWhen I sing it, I think of the kid in the wheelchair, and how when he gets to heaven, he gets to kick that wheelchair to the ground and walk away from it,\u201d Schultz says. \u201cNo matter what you\u2019re going through\u2014cancer, a disease, or being in a wheelchair\u2014it\u2019s powerful to think there\u2019s an endgame to that.\u201d", "otherInfo": "Tickets are now buy one get one free.

However, in 1986 the bars and clubs of Dublin were quite literally crawling with demented rockabillies and quiffed-up mutants. There were plenty of live bands for them to follow too (for those, at least, who weren\u2019t making the weekly trek to psychobilly \u2018Mecca\u2019 The KLUBFOOT at London\u2019s Hammersmith Clarendon), The Klingonz (who quickly moved to London to save on bus fares!), Sharkbait (who disbanded at their peak when lead singer Dave Finnegan landed a leading role in Alan Parker\u2019s motion picture \u2018The Commitments\u2019),there were Punky and \u2018Cramp-ish\u2019 bands like The Gorehounds, Kill-Devil Hill and the Boneshakers, while The Kroozers, Those Handsome Devils and The Crazy Wolves stayed closer to a \u2018traditional\u2019 1950\u2019s sound. Spellbound history - original line-up The Spells original line-up, circa 1984.You can view lots more old pics in our pictures section or on our message forums Spellbound was formed in 1986 by brothers Frankie and Adrian Hayes, who came from Bray, Co Wicklow, 15 miles south of Dublin City. Unlike other Irish bands of their time, Spellbound decided to head directly to mainland Europe, where their 1988 debut album \u2018Mystical Madness\u2019 was very well received and notched up many thousands in sales (amazingly, that album was never released in their home country). The boys blazed a brief trail across the rockabilly and psychobilly festivals of Germany and Scandanavia before, it seemed, vanishing back into the \u2018Hellfire\u2019 woods of County Wicklow. Spellbound history - new line-up Spellbound as they appear now...lots more pics in our pictures section or on our message forums Tentative moves toward a re-union were made in 2003 when guitarist friend Doyley (Klingonz, Demented are Go) contacted the Hayes brothers to inform them that copies of \u2018Mystical Madness\u2019 appeared to be changing hands on the internet for astronomical sums and to suggest he sit in on some gigs, if they could find a bass player. They drafted in Simon Farrell (ex- Sharkbait) and this was the line-up that appeared at Die-In-Style\u2019s \u2018Kings of Psychobilly 3\u2019 At Speyer, Germany in November 2003. Unfortunately, both Doyley and Adrian were forced to drop out soon after due to existing commitments, and were replaced by Dave Mc Donald (ex- Kroozers) and Brian O Higgins (a drummer Simon worked alongside while touring with American rockabillies The Blue Moon Boys) Their most recent album, \u2018A Fistful of Spells\u2019 is the result of ever-increasing calls from fans for that long-awaited follow-up to \u2018Mystical Madness\u2019. The 2005 Spellbound line-up, while remaining true to the style and spirit of the original, brings the band bang-up-to-date with a new batch of original songs, alongside some (previously unrecorded) versions of old-school, rockin\u2019-psycho classics.

The collective was signed to Prophecy Production, for which they recorded two albums \u2013 an EP titled \u201cPlan Be\u201d, released in 1998, which was made of four tracks and was more like a warm-up before the debut album than anything; and the follow-up, called \u201cA New World?\u201d \u2013 a full-length album, which was released in 1999 under the same Label, after which the group ended their activity for no apparent reason. The group did not receive any proper advertising and consequently has not achieved any success in the underground circles and finding any information about them is almost impossible nowadays. Much like later era IN THE WOODS\u2026, DRAWN explored an intriguing kind of music, that blends the tendencies and moods of Metal with psychedelic, progressive and ambient music, albeit Christer Cederberg, who was not the key figure behind ITW\u2019s songwriting, has his own vision of composing music in this style. The group\u2019s only full-length is impressively futuristic and forward-thinking, fusing contradicting elements to conceive a conceptual, spontaneous creation and can very well be considered one of the most innovative Norwegian projects. Their sombre, dark, atmospheric and eerie sound is unique and can not be compared to anything else, however, fans of IN THE WOODS\u2026 and OPETH, as light as the similarity between DRAWN and these band is, will find the engaging music of this group to be fascinating enough.

Tim grew up in Butte, MT in a household that did not support his musical career. He quickly learned if he wanted to make a reality of out his passion to sing and play guitar, he had to escape Big Sky Country. He packed his bags and made his way to the heart of country music, Nashville, TN. Soon after living in Nashville, a rodeo performance caught the attention of David Letterman. David was so impressed by Tim\u2019s music, he personally invited Tim to perform on The Late Show with David Letterman. Montana continued to write and record which earned him a worldwide publishing deal with the Spirit Music Group. This led to an introduction with ZZ Top\u2019s Billy Gibbons. The two of them collaborated on multiple different tracks including, \u201cThis Beard Came Here to Party\u201d which was the anthem for the Nashville Predator\u2019s 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Tim followed up with writing on Kid Rock\u2019s current single, \u201cTennessee Mountain Top\u201d and \u201cGreatest Show On Earth\u201d as well as Mac McAnally\u2019s current hit, \u201cAmarula Sun.\u201d In September 2017, Tim released his single, \u201cHillbilly Rich.\u201d Rolling Stone called the song an, \u201can ode to fantasies about telling off your boss, making it rain, and having everything all at once.\u201d Shortly after the song was released, Tim performed the single live on Fox & Friends.

He is most well known for his work with the band B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones, which he has described as \"a mixture of acoustic and electronic music with a lot of roots in folk and bluegrass as well as funk and jazz.\" Fleck, who is named after famous Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, was drawn to the banjo when he first heard Earl Scruggs play the theme song for the television show Beverly Hillbillies. He received his first banjo at age fifteen from his grandfather (1973). Later, Fleck would enroll in New York City's High School of Music and Art where he studied French horn. Almost immediately after high school, Fleck traveled to Boston to play with Jack Tottle and Mark Schatz in Tasty Licks. It is with Tasty Licks that Fleck played on his first major album. During this period, Fleck released his first solo album (1979) \"Crossing the Tracks\". It was Fleck's first foray into progressive bluegrass composition. Fleck would play on the streets of Boston with bassist Mark Schatz until the two formed Spectrum: the Band in 1981. Fleck toured with Spectrum until 1981. That year, Fleck was asked by Sam Bush and company to join New Grass Revival. Fleck performed with New Grass Revival for nine years. During this time, Fleck recorded another solo album, \"Drive.\" It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the then first-time category of Best Bluegrass Album (1988). After a 1988 phone call with bassist Victor Wooten, Fleck and Wooten formed B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones, rounded out with harmonica player Howard Levy and Wooten's percussionist brother Roy \"Future Man\" Wooten, who plays synthesizer-based percussion. Saxophonist Jeff Coffin joined the group with the album \"Left of Cool\". With the Flecktones, Fleck has been nominated for and won several Grammy awards. Fleck has shared Grammy wins with Asleep at the Wheel, Alison Brown, and Edgar Meyer.

She played Carnegie Hall at 12; at 13 signed with Rounder Records and later issued her debut, Secrets, and garnered the first of many nominations for Mandolin Player of the Year.

An alias of the guys behind Transa and Cascade. 2 . The illegitimate love child of Trevor Bennett's many and varied musical interests and influences. A singer and composer from a young age, Trevor has balanced with his love for industrial and hard rock a heavy involvement in classical music, choral and a capella singing, musical theatre, operatic performance, and dabblings in jazz, electronica, and metal. Early studies in piano and trumpet led to the guitars, bass, and eventual forays into programming and sequencing which make up the bulk of catcher's palette. What began as Trevor's solo endeavour has evolved into two separate musical entities - first, the studio construct, still primarily the domain of the vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, where his vocal layering and melodic and textural forays are played out to the fullest. The flip side of the project is the live band, a collective which is only made richer and more immediate by the emotional and musical contributions of all members - each a profound and talented player in his own right. Together, there is a commitment to the material and an attention to detail that make for a dynamic, engaging, and memorable performance. http://catcher.ca 3. An Indie Rock band formed in 1994 and based in Glasgow, Scotland. The band has had numerous lineups but essentially revolves around the songwriting of singer/guitarist Michael Barry.

After a few years apart, Reed and Young settled down in Los Angeles, recorded a short demo, and began playing locally. The demo found its way into the hands of super-producer Johnny K (Plain White T's, 3 Doors Down), and they cut the bulk of their first EP at NRG Studios in just one day. \"My favorite music is recorded that way,\" continues Reed. \"You get in a room, plug in, and cut songs live. The energy of the recording comes directly from the physical performance, and it puts the listener into that specific time and place.\" This self-titled Michigan Rattlers EP attracted glowing reviews from No Depression, Bluegrass Situation, B3 Science, and Rolling Stone, who named the band one of their \u201cTen New Country Artists You Need To Know\u201d in 2016. They spent the rest of that year and much of the next touring in support of this release. In September 2017, Pianist Christian Wilder was added to the band\u2019s lineup. Now a trio, the group headed into the studio to record their newest EP, Wasting the Meaning. Comprised of three cover songs, the project was conceived as a way to explore deeper into the recording process and pay homage to some of their favorite songwriters. The bands first full length record, \"Evergreen\", was released in September of 2018. Extensive touring followed in support of the release. January 2019 saw the addition of Tony Audia on drums as a full time member, rounding out the four-piece group. In another year of heavy touring, the band played headlining shows across the country, as well as support dates for artists such as: Bob Seger, Greensky Bluegrass, and Justin Townes Earle.", "otherInfo": "Michigan Rattlers at Globe Hall"}, {"Address": "18300 W Alameda Pkwy, Morrison, CO 80465", "Artist": "WAVEDASH ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8735547.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.6664666, -105.2048546], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Electronic", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Red Rocks Amphitheatre", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "SLANDER presents The Eye Strikes Back"}, {"Address": "18300 W Alameda Pkwy, Morrison, CO 80465", "Artist": "Dylan Matthew ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8617556.jpeg", "Coordinates": [39.6664666, -105.2048546], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "R&b/soul, Rnb-soul, Singer-songwriter, R&b, Pop", "Time": "7:00 PM", "Venue": "Red Rocks Amphitheatre", "moreBioInfo": "Singer-Songwriter/Producer/Engineer https://open.spotify.com/artist/6d0ZjIp5L7Ygy2l02HskRX", "otherInfo": "SLANDER presents The Eye Strikes Back"}, {"Address": "900 Baseline Rd, Boulder, CO 80302", "Artist": "Colorado Music Festival ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/8259556.jpeg", "Coordinates": [40.000023, -105.2819456], "Date": "2021-07-27", "EventDate": "Jul. 27th, 2021", "Genre": "Classical", "Time": "7:30 PM", "Venue": "Chautauqua Auditorium", "moreBioInfo": "Under the artistic vision of Maestro Peter Oundjian, the Colorado Music Festival thrills audiences of more than 20,000 each season with programming that embraces the most beloved classical music repertoire, while integrating world music and the works of exciting modern composers.
