I first saw these guys at the Van Halen Rising book launch party. I had a chance to meet and play with the band. What a great group- very humble and having fun playing early Van Halen. After the show I sent Edward Van Halen a picture and he replied, \"who is that? he looks more like me than I do!\" If you have a chance to see Fan Halen- do it! The music, the look and the show is spot on!\u201d - Mark Stone \u201cI really enjoyed the band at the Van Halen Rising book release party...

Do yourself a favor and take a trip back in time with the boys for a rocking good time.\u201d - John Watkins 5150 \u201cI hired Fan Halen to play at my book launch party in Pasadena last fall. They performed for a crowd of old school Pasadena Van Halen fans -- I'm talking people who saw Van Halen years before they were famous, back when VH was a backyard party band. A tough crowd to please, right? Not for Fan Halen. I had numerous people come up to me and tell me how impressed they were with how faithfully Fan Halen reproduced the classic VH vibe and sound. I can't say enough good things about this band and its members. If you're having a party hire them, and if you're on the fence about going to see them ... buy a ticket now.

The five-song EP and accompanying videos showcase a singular style that\u2019s emerged from an upbringing steeped in funk, soul and classic rock.

Dane Drewis\u2019 2010 solo debut \u201cRock and Soul\u201d is both incendiary and nostalgic, combining the melodic feel of Motown and classic 70\u2019s rock with a vocal style that is described as a mix of Bruno Mars, John Mayer, and Jack Johnson. As the front man for Cuesta Drive for six years, Dane has developed a commanding stage presence and an exceptional ability to get a crowd on its feet. Born into a family of rock musicians, his guitar playing is reminiscent of the greats\u2014Santana, Jimmy Page, and Stevie Ray Vaughn\u2014with influences from later artists such as Sublime and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

After forming Cuesta Drive in college, Dane went on to write and compose three albums with the band before embarking on his solo project.

That tireless dedication to his craft is what has earned him a Grammy nomination, the chance to perform at world-renowned festivals, and acclaim from the titans of the industry. Hailing from Stockholm, Alesso won over his country from the very start of his career. His second single as the lead artist, 2012\u2019s \u201cCalling (Losing My Mind)\u201d with the legendary Swedish House Mafia\u2019s Sebastian Ingrosso and Grammy award-winning OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, was certified 2x Platinum in Sweden while also reaching no. 1 on Billboard\u2019s US Hot Dance Club Songs. He consistently released remixes, including the Alesso Remix to \u201cPressure\u201d by Nadia Ali, Starkillers, and Alex Kenji which was named the \u201ctune of 2011\u201d by Kaskade en route to a nomination for Best Progressive Track at the International Dance Music Awards. While continuing to release remixes, Alesso was fine-tuning his debut album Forever. In 2013, he released \u201cIf I Lose Myself\u201d with OneRepublic which was certified 4x Platinum in Sweden and \u201cUnder Control\u201d with Calvin Harris featuring Hurts which was certified Gold in the United States. Alesso\u2019s ascension was sped up with the success of 2014\u2019s \u201cHeroes (We Could Be)\u201d featuring Tove Lo. With his production genius and honest songwriting on full display, the track became a worldwide hit. Again, he reached no. 1 on Billboard\u2019s US Dance Club Songs and no. 11 on the Top 40. It was certified Platinum in the US. Alesso has established himself as an entertainer who isn\u2019t afraid to push himself, his music, and his genre to the limits. He did this with \u201cHeroes,\u201d combining an electric beat with emotions through lyrics and melody that are not in line with what the genre presents. Alesso creates songs that fans can listen to in their car, but that transform into something larger-than-life when he performs. For all of his commercial success, Alesso has also set himself apart for his live performances. With his music and visuals, Alesso creates experiences that have made him one of the genre\u2019s most celebrated performers. In 2012, he joined Madonna as the opener during her MDNA tour. He\u2019s also moved fans at the biggest festivals music has to offer like Coachella, EDC, Ultra, and Tomorrowland. He and Hailee Steinfeld released \u201cLet Me Go\u201d with Florida Georgia Line and Watt; reaching no. 9 on the US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart and cracked the US Billboard Hot 100. His collaboration with Anitta, \u201cIs That For Me,\u201d cracked the Billboard\u2019s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs\u2019 top 25. This song earned a Radio Disney Music Award nomination. Alesso recently made his long-awaited return to both Brooklyn, New York and San Francisco, California.

Carefully pointing out that he has \"always had a deep passion for music,\" you know that his adoration of house has been a gateway into the lives of thousands and thousands of people. Over the years promoting and playing an enormous amount of parties including BBC, Brass, MAC's Garage, Does Your Mama Know? and currently LA's biggest house club DEEP, Marques has changed the face of Southern California nightclubbing and the presentation of its music, sound and scene. Today, he spends much of his time taking the sounds that emanate from his soul around the world, or laying them down in the studio in remixes and original compositions. Yet, he always returns to the club scene in his hometown of Los Angeles. He grew up in a loving, musical family that exposed him to everything from unique Afro rhythm sounds, jazz and soul to psychedelic rock.

The group started eight years ago in L.A. when a group of Hollywood Misfits, led by none other than Colby Veil \u201cThe Bastard Son of the Sunset Strip\u201d, realized Rock fans young and old, generations of Guns n\u2019 Roses fanatics, craved the dangerous, electric, intense show that Guns n\u2019 Roses were notorious for. Without question, Hollywood Roses has perfected the art of capturing the raw energy of a bygone era in Rock N\u2019 Roll, and gives to the fans the power and frenzy of a true 80\u2019s Guns and Roses show. From the non-stop parties, to the week long chaos, the beautiful girls, and oceans of booze, there\u2019s little reason to question why in 1988 Guns n Roses we\u2019re dubbed \u201cThe Most Dangerous Band in The World!\" They were a reflection of the reckless world in which they lived, the gasoline for the high octane music that they created. Upon the release of their ground breaking debut album \u201cAppetite for Destruction\u201d -in which over 28 million records were sold -it was an almost instantaneous one-way rocket launch to the top. Lead singer Colby Veil\u2019s incredible likeness to Axl Rose both in both appearance as well as vocal prowess helped pave the way for Hollywood Roses to rise up to become \u201cThe Most Authentic Guns n Roses Experience.\" There were no wigs and costumes, just a group of musicians who not only channeled the energy that Guns n\u2019 Roses had, but has always performed a show that is undeniably a true flashback in time. The band also includes Robo Hyrn on guitar as \u201cSlash\u201d, Leo Cuevas on bass as \u201cDuff\u201d, \"Ashes\" on guitar as \u201cIzzy\u201d and Justin Sandler (Tattooed Millionaires, Beautiful Creatures). Hollywood Roses have rocked numerous festivals including the debut year of \u2018Rocklahoma\u201d which had record breaking attendance and coverage in \"Rolling Stone\" and SXSW. Hollywood Roses has also toured the US, most notably playing high profile venues in Hollywood Las Vegas, Arizona, Texas, The Midwest and more. In 2008, Colby Veil was hand-picked by Guns N Roses original drummer Steven Adler to lead Adler\u2019s Appetite for the 20th Anniversary of Appetite for Destruction. The tour kicked off at Hollywood's world famous Key Club. On stage, Colby was joined by none other than Izzy, Duff and of course Steven Adler, performing Guns N Roses hits to amazed fans. Celebrities were in attendance including guitar God Slash. This show launched the beginning of a world tour for \u201cAdler\u2019s Appetite,\" which hit venues in South America and the U.S. Live Hollywood Roses delivers the ultimate tribute to the \"Appetite for Destruction\" era of Guns N Roses.

In a nod to his musical roots, Malana was recorded and filmed live with a full band at the home of Dane\u2019s parents, and it\u2019s a family affair through and through: Dane\u2019s mother and father (who use to kill it back in the day in a band called Freedom) can be heard singing backup and playing bass, respectively. The five-song EP and accompanying videos showcase a singular style that\u2019s emerged from an upbringing steeped in funk, soul and classic rock.

His interim move to the Big Apple provided numerous opportunities to tour nationwide while writing the music and score for the animation project and Broadway musical, The Day There Was No More Music, touted by some to be the next Lion King. The animation version is currently in production stages. Becoming one of the most sought after concert and performance-show entertainers started long before Las Vegas. Jimmy Hopper began singing at the age of three at the top of his lungs from the back-yard swing in Virginia with his audience of six siblings. His mother tells the story that the neighbors would come out to listen and remind her that \u201cHe has the voice of an angel\u2026he\u2019ll grow up to be a singer.\u201d Prophetic words indeed. Fast forward through years of performances and his numerous jingles written for television and radio. Jimmy secured vocal training from Darlene Romano, an opera teacher who taught him \u201cproper technique\u201d but, as Jimmy aptly states, \u201cdidn\u2019t mess with my style.\u201d The two years of training increased his range to an astounding five octaves. His journey continued, from San Francisco in the late 90s where he was awarded \u201cPop Vocalist of the Year\u201d by the San Francisco Concerto Orchestra, to Las Vegas in 1998. Interestingly enough, it was his first year at the Rio Hotel singing rock ballads that he began singing opera. One music critic provided the most apt description when he said, \u201cHopper is Freddie Mercury meets Andr\u00e9a Bocelli.\u201d The white spiked hair is startling in contrast to the strong opera vocals which flow from his lips, when in the next breath he takes on symphonic rock that brings the house down. The rest of the story is rave reviews\u2014from the four years as the Bellagio\u2019s headliner in Las Vegas, to engagements across the country from Harrah\u2019s Lake Tahoe to New England\u2019s Big E music festival to the Hoku Amphitheatre in Kona, Hawaii.

Touring the US and 11 other countries both as a headliner, and supporting acts such as Bon Iver, Jewel, John Hiatt, Suzanne Vega, Seal Styx and Yes, the fiercely independent and hardworking artist has developed a loyal international fan base, has had his work appear in over 100 television shows and films, and recently had a solo acoustic track, \u201cSkyway Drive-In\u201d (from 2013\u2019s Ladera) cross over 6.5 million streams on Spotify. Since his debut, Alexander\u2019s last 4 records were produced with Billy Mohler (Grammy Nominated writer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist). Bliss, his 6th full-length studio record, and first self-production, was recroded at his new Buddhaland Studios located in Ventura County, CA. \u201cIt was an amazing experience to be at the helm in my own studio, at long last,\u201d said Alexander, \u201cthere are many first takes on this record, which led to the songs feeling organic and honest.\u201d Bliss is a timeless tribute to both the artist's classic rock influences and more recent contemporaries such as Jonathan Wilson, Ryan Adams and Conor Oberst. Alexander\u2019s crystalline tenor and deft acoustic guitar are at the heart of all the tracks. The folk-light opener 'Evergreen' blends Paul Simon and Ram-era McCartney in its fingerpicked cadence and vivid lyrical imagery. \"Something Real Never Dies\" which calls to mind 80's bands like The Church and The Cure, is a dreamy pop rocker about lost loves that 'circle around you again and again.' The ultra-dark \"I Will Die Alone\" sounds like a forgotten gem, unearthed in a time capsule from the early 60's, with a Ricky Nelson-meets-Morricone vibe that you'll just want to put on repeat. \"Heart of California\" is a sun-soaked ode to all things west coast, with its driving Wilco/Petty energy, and the gorgeous lapsteel, courtesy of Ojai mainstay Jesse Siebenberg, who was also featured on Ladera, as well as many tracks on the new album. Also returning from Ladera, is keyboardist Peter Adams, whose sonic explorations have graced records for Josh Groban, Tears for Fears, Ricki Lee Jones, Macy Gray and countless others. Bassist Vic Ruiz and drummer Josh Grolemund, also from Alexander's live band appear, as well as vocalists Justine Bennett, Jamie Drake and Sarah Pigion whose lush harmony vocals on \u2018Heart of California\u2019, \u2018Hold Me Helpess\u2019 and the title track add to the 70\u2019s palette considerably. Aaron Sterling (John Mayer, The Civil Wars, Taylor Swift) returning from 2010\u2019s Mono Solo, also provides drums and percussion to three tracks on Bliss. For all of the heartache and lessons learned on the album, the closing title track leaves the listener on a sublime note of peace and forgiveness, one that is mirrored in the cover image, hand-drawn by veteran rock and roll artist Alan Forbes. Following the release of Bliss, Shane Alexander will tour the United States in summer and return to Europe in late fall 2016. The Freedom Machine, the politically-charged new musical, written and directed by Emmy-winner Larry Carpenter, featuring songs written by Shane Alexander, is currently in pre-production in Los Angeles.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "2968 Randolph Ave Unit #2, Costa Mesa, CA 92626", "Artist": "the LINE ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/9496199.jpeg", "Coordinates": [34.093994, -118.3287394], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Math Rock, Indie Rock, Progressive Alternative, Punk, Rock", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Commissary Lounge", "moreBioInfo": "The age of jagged-edged experimentation is upon us. Not since the Warholian Factory was at maximum output has the need for unbridled creativity been more crucial. We are stuck inside, metaphorically, spiritually and physically, with nothing but digital distraction and screaming head noise for company. The only escape is to let the imagination run rampant, electrify the senses, fire the cannons of the loose mind at full fury and meet the challenges of now head-on with absolute belief that we are here to fucking live. As such, we choose theLINE. To navigate the uncertainty, to find safe passage through the maelstrom, to feel a much-needed sense of freedom. It\u2019s a big word. Freedom. But strip the song writing, recordings and face melting live shows of theLINE back to their skeleton and freedom is the core value you\u2019ll find at the heart of this band and the music they create. Freedom of expressionism, experimentalism and high-voltage rip-the-skin-off-your-skull energy-ism. This, now as was then, is what theLINE delivers. A quick look back. From the early 1990s through to 2001 theLINE released four full-length studio albums to critical acclaim and achieved cult status globally as a dynamic and dangerous four piece that wasn\u2019t limited to the sounds of the time. While the \u201cCalifornian punk\u201d movement swept just about every guitar band of the time into it\u2019s all consuming three chord hook and melody tsunami (and theLINE got tossed in there with them by those too lazy to know better) the truth is the band stayed ruthless and committed to developing their own sound. As founding member Donald Horne explains \u201cPlaying art punk in the 90\u2019s was an interesting place to be, the pop punk world was exploding and we were always grouped in with those bands, but since our records played more like a high tempo\u2019ed RUSH 2112 or an early Iron Maiden record, we had to forge our own way, which was fine with us. We did our thing and have no regrets.\u201d Despite enjoying eager support from a solid and loyal fan base, theLINE took an extended hiatus professionally to get some living done. But Ryan Immegart and co-founder Donald Horne continued writing music together with a view that reforming the band was inevitable when the timing became right. It\u2019s a friendship forged on the discovery of the unknown. \u201cWe\u2019ve been songwriting partners since high school and we push\u2019s each another\u2019s ideas to a place that neither of us can reach without the other. That\u2019s where the sound of theLINE is born right there,\u201d says Immegart. Fast forward to today. Ryan and Donald, along with the unyielding energy of bassist Collin Schlesinger and drummer Jonah Immegart, form theLINE with arguably it\u2019s most formidable and creatively diverse lineup. Not to mention it\u2019s a family affair since Jonah is Ryan\u2019s son and Collin is practically his son-in-law. Says Immegart senior: \u201cUltimately we are pushing to write music that is timeless. There\u2019s no schtick. We\u2019re building upon the experimental foundations of our past with an expansive energy. We\u2019re here to break boundaries and genres that are all parts 70\u2019s prog, 80\u2019s punk, the art punk of the early 90\u2019s and churn it into something unknown, unpredictable and completely un-shit, and still with meaty hooks that\u2019ll rip right into you.\u201d", "otherInfo": "ChaserThe LineFourth In LineTBA21+$12 pre $15 dosDoors at 8On sale now Commissary Lounge is located at:2968 Randolph Ave Unit #2Costa Mesa, CA 92626 21+/ Full Bar For Venue Info, Tickets, all the latest show announcements and contests:Facebook, and @commissarylounge on IG"}, {"Address": "1623 1/2 N Cahuenga Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028", "Artist": "Natalie Gelman ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11357586.jpeg", "Coordinates": [34.093994, -118.3287394], "Date": "2021-07-24", "EventDate": "Jul. 24th, 2021", "Genre": "Folk, Singer Songwriter, Folk Rock, Americana, Alt Rock, Folk-pop, Pop Rock, Singer-songwriter, Alternative, Alt Country, Pop Folk", "Time": "8:30 PM", "Venue": "Hotel Cafe Record Release Show!", "moreBioInfo": "Attraction is inexplicable. It\u2019s pheromonal, quasi-spiritual, physiological and physical. For songwriter-pop artist Natalie Gelman, the pull to music has almost been innate. As an eight-year-old, she freely roamed the wilds of New York City, stoking the fire of her artistry, spurred on by violin and piano lessons, and her innate singing and songwriting gifts. The Ojai, California-based artist has aptly titled her milestone release, Moth To The Flame. The 13-song album is a sublimely melodic and heartfelt blend of polished production, telepathic musicianship, and finely crafted pop with emotionally raw lyrics and storytelling. Natalie\u2019s songwriting recalls sophisticated-but-still-pop tunesmiths such as Jewel, Sara Bareilles, and Jason Mraz. Her songs are subtly lush, detailed with ethereal atmospherics, majestic cello flourishes, chiming electric guitars, stately piano, and layers of dreamy vocals. The first single, Better Days, opens with a Motown-y bass hook and then blossoms into balmy, uplifting pop-rock. This track\u2019s feel-good energy is harnessed in its message of connection, inclusion, and unity. \u201cThis one really sums up the message of my music and my philosophy on life\" Natalie says about Better Days, \"I really believe in not giving up -- especially on yourself.

With a new member, a new vibe, and new songs made to get people moving and grooving all night long, the next chapter of the Dogs starts now. As the Dogs\u2019 realized their talents could expand far more than just 12 bar blues and guitar solos, they decided to develop something new. Coming from the city where surf/garage/psych bands are never in short supply, the last few months had felt repetitive and stale, like the band was idling. Trying on some dance-floor rhythms and sugary bass lines more influenced by classic funk and disco, their sound transformed. With the spark of this newfound energy and the space to push their songwriting and playing to new levels, Surf Disco was born. As you can taste bits and pieces of the classic and memorable rock n\u2019 roll sound the Dogs grew up on, this newborn fusion they have created is guaranteed to get you off your feet and it is reflected in the sophisticated groove changes and experimental structure of 2020 single, \u201cDog Days\u201d\u2014funk guitar and buttery vocals pointing to a refined, more mature sound that the Dogs are ready to further unveil.

She grew up in a traditional household, but quickly developed a rebellious spirit, which resulted in all too frequent encounters with the Iranian Morality Police. After an almost disastrous ending to a high-speed chase, for the crime of attending a party, it became obvious that Faith was a free spirit that could not be contained and leaving Iran was the only solution. Her journey to America was complicated and took multiple attempts but she eventually made it and for the first time, she had the power to be herself and make her own decisions. It didn\u2019t take long for Faith to embrace EDM once she arrived in Los Angeles. The life of a DJ represented everything that was denied to her \u2013 it was the life she was finally able to choose. She got her first chance by being discovered by top EDM agent Leo Corson while spinning vinyl on the sidewalk outside of a local record store in the San Fernando Valley. She was invited to perform as the opening act for an event called Sin City Massive. It was huge and she played a Hard House / Hard Trance set to a crowd of a couple thousand eager ravers. The fans loved her energy on stage and the artist Lady Faith was born. At the time, the North American rave scene was primarily located in warehouses, seedy clubs, in the forest or desert where the location of the event was unknown to the DJ beforehand. Faith performed at a countless number of these underground venues for many years growing with the North American scene, as we know it today. This dedication and perseverance is the reason why she performs and headlines on such high-profile events and festivals today all over North America. As further proof of her dedication to the harder styles, Lady Faith was invited to headline the Q-Dance Stage at Electric Daisy Carnival in 2012. This was such an amazing experience for her as she had the opportunity to play on a major festival with hundreds of thousands of people in attendance. Today, Faith has performed with almost all of the top Hardstyle acts and has headlined extensively both domestically and internationally, bringing her own brand of American Hardstyle to the world. Over the years, Lady Faith has represented and supported the growing Hardstyle scene throughout the continent of North America. Lady Faith is a DJ like no other DJ \u2013 she will rock you to the bone with her high-energy sets and fantastic skills on stage. She has a growing collection of tracks including chart toppers such as Moxie and Queen Bitch of the Universe, with many more in the works.

It was formed in 1980 by Jairo Varela, who became producer, director, songwriter, vocalist and guiro player. It also included Nicolas Cristanelo, on the piano; Alexis Lozano, on the trombone; Francisco Garcia, on the bass; Luis Pacheco, on the congas; as well as vocalists Jorge Bassam and Hector Viveros. Grupo Niche's first album: \"Al Pasito\" was released that same year, 1980, and placed their native Colombia in a modest position in the salsa world. \"Querer Es Poder\" was Grupo Niche's second album, released in 1981, one year immediately after the first. The group's success was growing larger. \"Trateno\" became the group's third album, which featured \"Atrato Viajero\", one of Varela's compositions of his teen years. And, in 1984, Grupo Niche released \"No Hay Quinto Malo\", which featured their signature song, \"Cali Pachanguero\". But, perhaps Grupo Niche's best recording was their next release, \"Se Paso!\", produced in 1985 under the New York Latin Records label. In 1986, the band incorporated Puerto Rican vocalist Tito Gomez, who had previously worked with the famous Puerto Rican salsa group, la Sonora Poncena, and Ray Barretto, the Godfather of Latin Jazz. Later that year, 1986, Grupo Niche released \"Me Huele A Matrimonio\". Afterward, yet another Puerto Rican joined, the pianist Israel Tanenbaum, who would eventually separate from the group and join a Niche spin-off band: Orquesta Guayacan. Grupo Niche is known for both its vigorous, uptempo dance music as well as slower-paced romantic numbers. Among its best known hits are \"Cali Pachanguero\", \"Del Puente Pa'll\u00e1\", \"Sin Sentimientos\", \"Una Aventura\", \"Etnia\", \"Gotas de Lluvia\", \"Han Cogido la Cosa\", \"Mi Pueblo\", Hagamos Lo Que Diga Corazon, \"Duele Mas\", \"Nuestro Sue\u00f1o\", and the famous cumbia \"Canoa Rancha\". Some of the most famous singers from Niche throughout its changing history include Tito Gomez, Moncho Santana, Charlie Cardona as well as Willy Garcia and Javier Vasquez, now members of the group 'Son de Cali'. They have been very successful, and some of their songs are considered Classics of Salsa Music. The group still enjoys some of its past successes, and, as of 2006, is on tour, making worldwide presentations, and singing their most memorable songs.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "4212 W Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90029-2110", "Artist": "Jackie Beat ", "ArtistImage": "https://assets.prod.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png", "Coordinates": [34.0938307, -118.282422], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "No genre available", "Time": "11:30 AM", "Venue": "El Cid", "moreBioInfo": "No artist bio available", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "11003 Sports Arena Dr, Pico Rivera, CA 90601", "Artist": "Scotty Boy ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11382143.jpeg", "Coordinates": [34.0257089, -118.0459845], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Nu Disco, Techno, House Music, Tech House, Deep House, House", "Time": "12:00 PM", "Venue": "Festival Colombiano 2021", "moreBioInfo": "Scott Schroer aka SCOTTY BOY is a veteran DJ and Producer with over 25 years in the music scene under his belt.

Now releasing a new album titled Mama\u2019s Hometown, Celso has established a solid career, becoming one of the busiest and most respected blues artists in Southern California. Brazilian guitarist Celso Salim had his first contact with the guitar when he was six years old. At the age of 12 the talented young musician started to listen to his first Blues records, which changed his life forever. Since then Celso knew what he wanted to be, a Blues guitarist. For years he studied guitar hours each day, learning from old records by artists such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Freddie King, BB King, and Johnny Winter. A little later he began listening to 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s artists like the Allman Brothers Band, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. At age 17, Celso moved to the US for the first time, spending 3 years studying music and performing live shows. During this period he was exposed to other genres like Soul, Jazz, Folk and Country. This time would later have great influence on Celso\u2019s music. In Brazil, Celso has built a solid fan base, releasing 5 solo albums since 2001 and is considered to be one of the best guitarists in the country. He has also toured and recorded with prominent artists in the Brazilian Blues/Rock scene. Frequently featured among top Brazilian acts, Celso has performed at it's biggest festivals and venues. He has toured Europe and opened for legendary artist B. B. King as well as Deep Purple and John Hammond. He has also toured with bluesman Larry McCray and performed with blues legends Magic Slim and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith (Muddy Waters drummer).

Her song \"Who Can See the Blue the Same Again?\" was released earlier in 2005 as a single, paying tribute to the tsunami survivors and raising much needed money for The Tsunami Fund of The PRASAD Project.

The highly engaging four-piece dynamically performs around one microphone, where each instrument and voice crafts a specific part of each story; creating intimate, savory folk music that warms the heart and feeds the soul.\u201d -Nicholas Edward Williams, Earthtone Booking- The Riverside originated in Southern California where founding member, Jacob Jeanson (songwriter & guitar), was attending Westmont College in 2012. In his senior year, the band formed in hopes of winning Santa Barbara\u2019s battle of the bands. As an energetic and engaging folk band with foot stomping musical companions, the group was able to win the competition and release their first album with the winnings. In the following years, Jake got to play with many talented friends and personalities which helped mold the band\u2019s vision and created time to grow in tasteful and intentional songwriting; a nostalgic yet refreshing charm that leads listeners across a grand frontier of warm and beautiful scenery. However, the band was able to make the jump to full time when his wife Lorien Jeanson (mandolin & harmony) was added to the lineup. Lorien is originally from the redwood forest and farmlands of Northern California, but ended up attending the same college as Jake, where they met and fell in love. The duo swiftly began touring with a rotating cast of friends; playing in theatres, venues, festivals, and living room concerts across the United States. Regardless of their current friend lineup, the group aims to create a magical and organic vibe which translates into the feeling of the music, often singing and playing around a single old fashioned microphone, seamlessly blending the musical composition of their harmonies and instruments. Since 2012, the band has released 4 homegrown records and an EP, with more songs and albums in the works. Growing up and being raised listening to the likes of The Eagles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Jake and Lorien grew an appreciation and aim for group harmonies and heartfelt authenticity , while also striving to be amazing live performers like their modern influences , a few being Fleet Foxes, Mandolin Orange, and The Head and the Heart.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "168 N Marina Dr, Long Beach, CA 90803", "Artist": "Scott Ellison Band ", "ArtistImage": "https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/11353983.jpeg", "Coordinates": [33.7471979, -118.1150232], "Date": "2021-07-25", "EventDate": "Jul. 25th, 2021", "Genre": "Blues Rock", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Venue": "Scott Ellison Band Opening for Josh Smith--Malainey's Grill", "moreBioInfo": "A talented singer-songwriter, guitarist, and blues-rocker, Scott Ellison was born on February 13, 1954, in Tulsa, OK. By the '70s, Tulsa had become an unexpected hotbed of blues-based rock bands as proven by both Eric Clapton and Freddie King's backing bands hailing from the area. It was the perfect match for Ellison with his heavy guitar shredding blues style. It was around that same time that Ellison began playing with legends in the business, such as country singer Jesseca James (Conway Twitty's daughter) in 1977 and renowned bluesman Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown in 1981. Ellison relocated to Los Angeles, CA by the mid-'80s, however, keeping his music career going by playing with The Box Tops. The Shirelles, Marvalettes, JJ Jackson, The Drifters, The Coasters, Gary \"US\" Bonds and Peaches & Herb. By the '90s he had formed his own blues band and opened for the likes of Joe Cocker, Roy Orbison, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Leon Russell, Bobby Bland and Buddy Guy. It was also around this time that Ellison began issuing his first solo albums, including the titles \u201cChains of Love\u201d(1993) and \u201cLive at Joey\u2019s\u201d(1995). Shortly after returning back home to Tulsa in the mid-nineties, Ellison issued his third release, \u201cSteamin\u2019\u201d(1997) followed by \u201cOne Step From the Blues\u201d(2000), which featured several other Tulsa musicians backing him. In 2001 Ellison issued his first release for the Burnside label, \u201cCold Hard Cash\u201d, which was produced and co-written by longtime Robert Cray producer Dennis Walker. The album proved to be highly successful, and was followed with \u201cBad Case of the Blues\u201d(2003). The early 2000\u2019s were a very successful time for Scott playing at giant festivals, including playing The Montreal Jazz and Blues Festival in front of 40,000 screaming people. The later 2000\u2019s brought 2008\u2019s\u201dIce Storm\u201d produced by Earwig Records. Another album that not only received great reviews, but it contained Scott\u2019s first #1 Blues Hit: \"Cadillac Woman\u201d. Scott's biggest thrill as a performer was opening up for BB King, at the Performing Arts Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2009. BB King called Scott out to play twice during his show. Quite a thrill for Scott: \"I'll never forget that moment. It was the musical thrill of my life, having your idol call you out on stage!\" His last CD, \"Walkin Through The Fire\", was produced on his own label JSE Records Inc. This CD received rave reviews. Songs from \"Walkin Through The Fire\" were written with Walt Richmond and Charles Tuberville, who both co-produced the CD. Walt has toured and recorded with Bonnie Raitt, and most recently toured and played keyboards on JJ Cale's and Eric Clapton's Grammy winning album: \"Road to Escondido\". Walt also toured and recorded on Eric Clapton's last 5 CD\u2019s including: \u201cClapton\u201d (2010), \"Old Sock\" (2013), Eric Clapton and Friends \"The Breeze\" (An Appreciation of JJ Cale). In addition to solo records and playing with other artists, Ellison has also penned songs that have appeared in such hit TV shows as Sister Sister, Eye on L.A., and the soap opera Santa Barbara, as well as the soundtrack to the Ben Affleck motion picture Reindeer Games, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Joan of Arcadia, Saving Grace, Smash and four songs on 2012\u2019s hit TV show Justified on the FX Network. Scott was also pleased to see himself listed in the film credits for the world wide release of the movie \"Feast of Love\" starring Morgan Freeman in September 2007. Scott co-wrote, sang, played and co-produced his song \"Don't Push Your Luck\" that appears early in the movie. Scott just recently struck gold again with another song co-written by Scott in which he sang and performed \"Jesus Loves Me\" (Baby Why Don't You) in the new Blockbuster feature film \"Home Front\" starring Jason Statham, James Franco, Winona Ryder and Kate Bosworth. It became a single from the movie on JSE Records. Scott's previous CD released by Red Parlor Records on May 12, 2015 is called \"Elevator Man\". Produced by Walt Richmond, Eric Clapton's keyboard player on Eric's last 5 CD's. Scott was inducted into The Oklahoma Blues Hall of Fame in May 2013. He continues to tour in the US and Canada, performing around 200 shows a year. On June 13, 2017, Red Parlor Records will release Scott's newest CD called \"Good Morning Midnight\".

He toured the west coast, the midwest, and sporadic shows along the east coast in support of this first release. In 2012, he funded his second album using the crowdsourcing platform, Kickstarter.

Mike Vitale set up his own tours along the west coast playing wineries, venues, bars, and colleges in support of this self-titled effort.

Fox Parkinson's Research Foundation as a one-year-long campaign to raise money for Parkinson's Research.

Jefferson Starship, the name created by Kantner for his 1971 solo debut \u201cBlows Against The Empire\u201d recording, has endured 40 years as one of rock\u2019s most legendary bands. That recording was the first and only to ever be nominated for literary science fiction\u2019s Hugo Award \u2026 a stellar achievement. Co- founder David Freiberg also started the legendary Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Fillmore era San Francisco band who often shared the bill with the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. David is a world famous singer, producer, composer and multi-instrumentalist. He was also a member of Jefferson Airplane, and co- wrote one of Jefferson Starship\u2019s all-time biggest hits, \u201cJane\u201d \u2013 which he performs. Donny Baldwin became part of the San Francisco music scene in the early 70s. From 1973 to 1978 Donny was with the Elvin Bishop Band. During this time he toured and recorded six albums, which included the #1 hit single, \u201cFooled Around and Fell In Love\u201d. Donny was a member of Jefferson Starship from 1981 to 1989 and rejoined in 2008. In January 1994, he joined the Jerry Garcia Band. He has toured, recorded and played with Artists such as Kenny Logins, Pablo Cruise, Chuck Berry, Van Morrison, Ronnie Montrose, Greg Allman, Heart, Lydia Pense & Cold Blood, 38 Special and Eddie Money. Chris Smith joined Jefferson Starship in 1998, instantly winning the job of keyboardist, having toured with The Supremes and Lou Bega. Chris has gone on to place music in film and television including the #1 rated series \u201cCSI.\u201d In 2000 he assumed the seeming impossible task of playing piano and (synth) bass simultaneously \u2026 a feat only duplicated by the legendary Ray Manzarek of the Doors. Chris has been keyboardist longer than any in the band\u2019s fabled history. Cathy Richardson joined Jefferson Starship in 2008, and anchors the historic \u2018role\u2019 made famous by Grace Slick. She is an award winning music artist, graphic artist, and clothing designer. Her professional credits include fronting her own successful rock band, producing and releasing seven albums on various indie record labels. She was nominated for a GRAMMY Award for Art Direction of her band\u2019s 2003 release, \u201cThe Road to Bliss,\u201d which also received two DIY Awards (Do It Yourself in Film, Books and Music) for Album Art of the Year and Producer of the Year. Her latest release, \u201cDelusions of Grandeur,\u201d topped the 2007 DIYs when she won both Album and Producer of the Year. She portrayed Janis Joplin in the original Off Broadway cast of the hit show \u201cLove, Janis\u201d and also in Chicago, Sag Harbor, NY, San Francisco, Phoenix and Tucson.

Discovering vintage country music through his grandfather\u2019s record collection, he was bitten with the urge to form his own original group and write his original songs. The first iteration of the West of Texas band began in 2003, and the group shared the stage with other purveyors of \u201creal\u201d country music, such as James Intveld, Red Meat, Wayne Hancock, Big Sandy, 1100 Springs, among others. The original group released a 3-song EP in 2009 and began working on a full-length album. Unfortunately, singer Jerry Zinn had health problems that forced a seven-year hiatus for the group. When Zinn recovered and found himself able to sing again, an exciting new lineup of West of Texas assembled in 2019, just before the Covid-19 pandemic shut down live music across the globe.

Born and raised in San Francisco, he grew up with an immense appreciation and love for music. In fact, he taught himself to play piano at the age of four and at fifteen started songwriting. By the following year he taught himself how to play guitar, and developed his talents into his signature style today. Considered a \u201cYouTube Sensation\u201d to his fans and musical peers, he is acknowledged as a pioneer of the acoustic R&B /soul movement on the internet. Passion was one of the first Asian-Americans to go viral online with his famous original songs \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201cWell Done,\u201d and his acoustic covers of \u201cSo Sick\u201d and \u201cCater 2 U\u201d featuring Melvin. His subscriber base has exceeded 170,000 followers and has over 26 million channel views. Passion is well versed in travel as he has toured across North America and internationally in more than a dozen countries. He has performed with artists including Colbie Caillat, Kirk Franklin, Bobby Valentino, Jo Koy, Ernie Halter, Alain Clark, and Goapele among others. In addition to his writing and vocal talents, he is also an up and coming producer, creating tracks for Taboo (Black Eyed Peas), Slim (112), Megan Rochelle & more. Aside from his love for music, Passion has a heart for people. After doing volunteer work in Ghana in 2007, he was inspired to initiate the Empty Suitcase Project in Tanzania: a music and art project that believes in providing kids with an opportunity to find their own creative passions. For more information, check out the Empty Suitcase project Facebook Page here: http:// www.facebook.com/pages/The-Empty-Suitcase-Project/356118058470 Passion believes that music has the power to change things. He says, \u201cAs artists, we carry some type of leadership. It's a wonderful thing to be heard, but it's also a responsibility.\" Passion feels that although popular music sounds good, it lacks in substance and believes that the music industry needs more positive role models which is where his slogan, \"Music With A Message\" derives from. In late 2011, Jeremy Passion teamed up with producer Jesse Barrera (Formerly from San Diego based band, My American Heart) and independently released his first full-length album \"For More Than a Feeling\u201d that reached as high as #4 in the R&B/Soul Charts on iTunes and a concept EP which reached the #9 spot on the R&B/Soul Charts entitled \u201cPixelated\u201d dedicated to people in long- distance relationships.", "otherInfo": "No event info available"}, {"Address": "6617 S.

By the '70s, Tulsa had become an unexpected hotbed of blues-based rock bands as proven by both Eric Clapton and Freddie King's backing bands hailing from the area. It was the perfect match for Ellison with his heavy guitar shredding blues style. It was around that same time that Ellison began playing with legends in the business, such as country singer Jesseca James (Conway Twitty's daughter) in 1977 and renowned bluesman Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown in 1981. Ellison relocated to Los Angeles, CA by the mid-'80s, however, keeping his music career going by playing with The Box Tops. The Shirelles, Marvalettes, JJ Jackson, The Drifters, The Coasters, Gary \"US\" Bonds and Peaches & Herb. By the '90s he had formed his own blues band and opened for the likes of Joe Cocker, Roy Orbison, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Leon Russell, Bobby Bland and Buddy Guy. It was also around this time that Ellison began issuing his first solo albums, including the titles \u201cChains of Love\u201d(1993) and \u201cLive at Joey\u2019s\u201d(1995). Shortly after returning back home to Tulsa in the mid-nineties, Ellison issued his third release, \u201cSteamin\u2019\u201d(1997) followed by \u201cOne Step From the Blues\u201d(2000), which featured several other Tulsa musicians backing him. In 2001 Ellison issued his first release for the Burnside label, \u201cCold Hard Cash\u201d, which was produced and co-written by longtime Robert Cray producer Dennis Walker. The album proved to be highly successful, and was followed with \u201cBad Case of the Blues\u201d(2003). The early 2000\u2019s were a very successful time for Scott playing at giant festivals, including playing The Montreal Jazz and Blues Festival in front of 40,000 screaming people. The later 2000\u2019s brought 2008\u2019s\u201dIce Storm\u201d produced by Earwig Records. Another album that not only received great reviews, but it contained Scott\u2019s first #1 Blues Hit: \"Cadillac Woman\u201d. Scott's biggest thrill as a performer was opening up for BB King, at the Performing Arts Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2009. BB King called Scott out to play twice during his show. Quite a thrill for Scott: \"I'll never forget that moment. It was the musical thrill of my life, having your idol call you out on stage!\" His last CD, \"Walkin Through The Fire\", was produced on his own label JSE Records Inc. This CD received rave reviews. Songs from \"Walkin Through The Fire\" were written with Walt Richmond and Charles Tuberville, who both co-produced the CD. Walt has toured and recorded with Bonnie Raitt, and most recently toured and played keyboards on JJ Cale's and Eric Clapton's Grammy winning album: \"Road to Escondido\". Walt also toured and recorded on Eric Clapton's last 5 CD\u2019s including: \u201cClapton\u201d (2010), \"Old Sock\" (2013), Eric Clapton and Friends \"The Breeze\" (An Appreciation of JJ Cale). In addition to solo records and playing with other artists, Ellison has also penned songs that have appeared in such hit TV shows as Sister Sister, Eye on L.A., and the soap opera Santa Barbara, as well as the soundtrack to the Ben Affleck motion picture Reindeer Games, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Joan of Arcadia, Saving Grace, Smash and four songs on 2012\u2019s hit TV show Justified on the FX Network. Scott was also pleased to see himself listed in the film credits for the world wide release of the movie \"Feast of Love\" starring Morgan Freeman in September 2007. Scott co-wrote, sang, played and co-produced his song \"Don't Push Your Luck\" that appears early in the movie. Scott just recently struck gold again with another song co-written by Scott in which he sang and performed \"Jesus Loves Me\" (Baby Why Don't You) in the new Blockbuster feature film \"Home Front\" starring Jason Statham, James Franco, Winona Ryder and Kate Bosworth. It became a single from the movie on JSE Records. Scott's previous CD released by Red Parlor Records on May 12, 2015 is called \"Elevator Man\". Produced by Walt Richmond, Eric Clapton's keyboard player on Eric's last 5 CD's. Scott was inducted into The Oklahoma Blues Hall of Fame in May 2013. He continues to tour in the US and Canada, performing around 200 shows a year. On June 13, 2017, Red Parlor Records will release Scott's newest CD called \"Good Morning Midnight\".

Born and raised in San Francisco, he grew up with an immense appreciation and love for music. In fact, he taught himself to play piano at the age of four and at fifteen started songwriting. By the following year he taught himself how to play guitar, and developed his talents into his signature style today. Considered a \u201cYouTube Sensation\u201d to his fans and musical peers, he is acknowledged as a pioneer of the acoustic R&B /soul movement on the internet. Passion was one of the first Asian-Americans to go viral online with his famous original songs \u201cLemonade\u201d and \u201cWell Done,\u201d and his acoustic covers of \u201cSo Sick\u201d and \u201cCater 2 U\u201d featuring Melvin.

For more information, check out the Empty Suitcase project Facebook Page here: http:// www.facebook.com/pages/The-Empty-Suitcase-Project/356118058470 Passion believes that music has the power to change things. He says, \u201cAs artists, we carry some type of leadership. It's a wonderful thing to be heard, but it's also a responsibility.\" Passion feels that although popular music sounds good, it lacks in substance and believes that the music industry needs more positive role models which is where his slogan, \"Music With A Message\" derives from.
